<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>
<p>The Daily Mail, MailOnline, and Mail on Sunday are owned by DMG Media (formerly Associated Newspapers), a subsidiary of the Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT). In addition to the Daily Mail, MailOnline, and Mail on Sunday, DMG Media publishes the Metro and its website, metro.co.uk. The Daily Mail and General Trust also owns companies including events firm DMG Events, risk modelling company Risk Management Solutions, and a 49 percent stake in Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC, which publishes financial magazines. The Daily Mail, MailOnline, the Mail on Sunday, and Metro’s offices are in the same building in Kensington, London. DMG Media has offices around the United Kingdom, as well as in Dublin, New York City, and Sydney.</p>
<p>Daily Mail and General Trust is a publicly traded company. However, the company has been largely controlled by the Harmsworth family since Alfred and Harold Harmsworth founded the Daily Mail in 1896. Harold Harmsworth, then-chairman of the trust, was given the aristocratic title of “the 1st Viscount Rothermere” in 1919. All subsequent chairmen have had the same hereditary title, including Harold Harmsworth’s great grandson and current chairman, the 4th Viscount Rothermere (often referred to in the U.K. as “Lord Rothermere”).</p>
<p>The site runs advertisements and sponsored content.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>The tabloid-style dailmail.co.uk publishes hundreds of articles daily. The site features articles published in the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday’s print editions, as well as content produced exclusively for the website by MailOnline’s newsroom. Headlines are generally long and often provocative, sometimes to the point of sensational. They are often printed in large type with capitalised words. Photographs make up much of the site’s content. A sidebar on the right side of many pages, titled “Don’t Miss” (formerly Femail Today”) and widely referred to in the United Kingdom as the “sidebar of shame,” features attention-grabbing celebrity gossip headlines and photographs. Popular topics include crime in Britain, the royal family, and celebrity bikini shots. The site also publishes articles produced by The Associated Press, Reuters, and the Press Association.</p>
<p>Sections include News, Sport, U.S. Showbiz, Health, Science, Femail, and Money. The “Femail” section features content geared toward women. The Columnists section publishes opinion pieces by roughly 30 columnists at the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday, as well as guest columnists, including British TV host Piers Morgan.</p>
<p>MailOnline articles range from British news stories (“Campaigners call on Theresa May to ban eating DOG MEAT in Britain as they claim the practice is on the rise”) and U.S. news stories (“Republicans fear Democratic 'blue wave' could hit them hard in safe seats where suburban women are angry at Trump and anyone who backs him”) to tabloid gossip (“Kim Kardashian gets back to business with racy underwear post for Yeezy... as VERY nasty feud with Kourtney over money and motherhood explodes on Twitter”).</p>
<hr>
<h3>Credibility</h3>
<p>Articles on dailymail.co.uk are generally written by Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday, or MailOnline reporters. Articles are often based on firsthand reporting and credible third-party sources, but also frequently rely on tips, tweets, and other social media posts, and anonymous sources. News articles often link to outside sources, including The Sun, the BBC, the New York Daily News, and the New York Post’s Page Six. Health and Science sections frequently do not link to reports cited but are generally accurate. Images are mostly attributed.</p>
<p>Although the site’s long and occasionally speculative headlines highlight particularly controversial or salacious facts, NewsGuard found that headlines on the site generally reflect the content of articles accurately.</p>
<p>Columnist and opinion articles include the writer’s name, in capital letters, in the headline, signalling that what follows is opinion.</p>
<p>When reporting on news, the site’s articles and headlines are generally written from a point of view. For example, news coverage in the days leading up to a January 2019 parliamentary vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal featured headlines such “Remainer MPs plot 'a very British coup': Tories Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve are accused of being behind plan to sideline May after crunch Brexit vote despite warnings it will KILL the government.” News headlines and coverage in this three-day window consistently presented May and her Brexit deal in a positive light, while denigrating politicians opposing her deal. This has been a consistent viewpoint in news articles in recent months. In November 2018, the site ran an article titled “Fury at preening Tory saboteurs: Angry backlash against Brexiteer plotters bidding to bring down Theresa May as moderate MPs warn a coup will destroy the government, damage the economy and jeopardise Brexit altogether.”</p>
<p>In November 2016, the Daily Mail received widespread criticism for a front-page cover headlined “ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE.” The headline referred to three British judges who had ruled that the government would require the consent of Parliament before it could trigger Article 50 and exit the European Union. The article is still available in the News section of dailymail.co.uk with the headline “Enemies of the people: Fury over 'out of touch' judges who have 'declared war on democracy' by defying 17.4m Brexit voters and who could trigger constitutional crisis.”</p>
<p>Although consistent with the tradition among many European newspapers of taking sides in political controversies, a newspaper’s website is accessible to anyone on the internet, even to those who might not be as familiar with its political perspective as readers from the paper’s home country.</p>
<p>Beyond political news, other articles on dailymail.co.uk are frequently infused with opinion. Celebrity news regularly contains the writer’s opinions about the individual’s beauty or appearance, habits, lifestyle, and fashion choices. A January 2019 news article “How Meghan's favourite avocado snack - beloved of all millennials - is fuelling human rights abuses, drought and murder” argued that although Meghan Markle — a frequent dailymail.co.uk target — “has rightly been praised for making the fusty old Royal Family more socially and ethically aware…for someone who wants to save the planet, she’s committed something of a faux pas with avocados.” After describing the “problems” associated with avocado consumption, the article ends by suggesting that, “given the damaging cost of ‘avocado fever,’ might it not be better to eat them more sparingly — and not, for example, serve them up on silver platters? Since Meghan’s guest was invited to high tea, surely it should have been a case of let him eat cake.”</p>
<p>Although dailymail.co.uk’s mix of opinion and news in political coverage is standard fare for many European news organisations, its unreserved expression of opinion when reporting on a wide variety of subjects and people is such that NewsGuard has concluded that the website does not meet its standard for handling the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>
<p>MailOnline, the Daily Mail, and the Mail on Sunday are regulated by the UK’s Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), through which publications contractually agree to be held liable for breaching IPSO’s Editors’ Code of Practice, which includes standards around issues such as accuracy, privacy, harassment, and discrimination.</p>
<p>Dailymail.co.uk has published hard-hitting articles that have had far-reaching impact. For example, in September 2016 the site broke the story of former U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner’s underage sexting scandal with a 15-year-old girl. The article prompted an FBI inquiry, which in turn led to a renewed inquiry into the use of a private email server by Hillary Clinton, then-Democratic nominee for U.S. President.</p>
<p>The Daily Mail, MailOnline, and Mail on Sunday have won numerous prizes in recent years. In 2017, the Daily Mail won Newspaper of the Year at the National Press Awards. The judges stated that “From crusading reports on press freedom to Brexit, the sepsis scandal, the madness of drivers using mobile phones, wasteful foreign aid spending, betrayal of Afghan interpreters, the harm caused by 'plastic poison' and the battle to end the witch-hunt against British troops, the conviction of the paper's commentary and campaigning in 2016 was matched only by its energy. It is also never afraid to have a strong opinion.” The Mail on Sunday won the same award in 2016. In 2018, the Daily Mail won “Campaign of the Year” at the British Journalism Awards. That same year, Mail on Sunday reporters also won prizes at the British Journalism Awards in “Business, Finance and Economics Journalism” and “Popular Journalism.”</p>
<p>However, in recent years, dailymail.co.uk has also published some content that has damaged reputations, caused widespread alarm, or constituted harassment or invasion of privacy.</p>
<p>For example, a November 2017 article headlined, “BREAKING NEWS: ‘Gunshots fired’ as armed police surround Oxford Circus tube station and shoppers flee ‘after lorry ploughs into pedestrians’” relied on information in a 10-day old tweet, while crediting the information to eyewitnesses. Despite police activity at Oxford Circus that day, gunshots were not fired and there was no lorry incident. The MailOnline article and its tweet were widely shared on social media. Although MailOnline posted a correction shortly after publishing the information, IPSO ruled that its actions violated its Editors’ Code. IPSO’s ruling stated that a publication must “demonstrate that it has taken appropriate care over the accuracy of the information it publishes.”</p>
<p>The ruling took issue with the fact that "the specific claims that ‘witnesses at the scene described seeing a lorry on the pavement surrounded by police,’ and that ‘the pavement was said to be covered in blood,’ reported in the article had come from a tweet about an unrelated event. The ruling further stated that “these claims were significant, as they mischaracterised the nature of the incident and misrepresented reports from eye-witnesses” and that “the publication had failed to take care over the accuracy of the article and the information published in the tweet.” The ruling also noted that the MailOnline’s correction “was published promptly following notification from IPSO that the article had received complaints.”</p>
<p>In December 2015, former Daily Mail columnist Katie Hopkins wrote that members of a Muslim family barred by U.S. officials from boarding a plane from London to Los Angeles had ties to the al-Qaida terror group. Hopkins described brothers Mohammed Tariq Mahmood and Mohammed Zahid Mahmood as “extremists” with terrorist ties. Later that month, a second column written by Hopkins published a photograph of the family’s home and suggested that Mohammed Tariq Mahmood's son was behind a Facebook page containing extremist content. In December 2016, a year later, MailOnline paid damages to the family and released a correction clarifying that members of the Mahmood family “are not extremists, nor do they have links to Al Qaeda.”</p>
<p>In April 2017, the Daily Mail agreed to pay damages to Melania Trump for a 2016 article suggesting that the American first lady formerly worked as an escort. In a statement, the Daily Mail and MailOnline wrote, “We accept that these allegations about Mrs Trump are not true and we retract and withdraw them.”</p>
<p>These incidents, while limited in number given the volume of stories published by the site, are significant in their damaging impact and demonstrate significant misfires in a process that should better ensure the accuracy of stories of this import before they are published to dailymail.co.uk's vast audience. For this reason, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not consistently meet the standard for gathering and presenting news and information responsibly.</p>
<p>The bottom of the site links to a “How to Complain” page, which provides clear directions for reporting factual inaccuracies to the site and submitting complaints to IPSO. The site publishes corrections and clarifications, either in italics below the corrected article or as a separate post titled “Corrections &#x26; Clarifications.” The site does not have a dedicated corrections page, but the “News” page features a link to the most recently published standalone correction.</p>
<p>The site sometimes deletes articles without promptly publishing a correction. For example, in July 2018 the site published an article headlined “Powder Keg Paris: A devastating report reveals 300,000 illegal migrants are living in one French Suburb… ANDREW MALONE explores the tensions in a community at odds with mainstream society.” The article, criticised on Twitter for containing numerous factual errors, was deleted from the website in August 2018. In February 2019, the site published a correction in its online corrections column, six months after the deletion of the article and two weeks after the publication of IPSO’s ruling on the case.</p>
<p>Despite these shortcomings in its corrections procedures, because of the site’s participation in IPSO, its clear guidelines for reporting errors, and its general practice of publishing corrections, NewsGuard has determined that the site meets its standards for regularly publishing corrections.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Transparency</h3>
<p>Articles sometimes list the name of the writer, but generally do not provide biographical or contact information. Bylines link to other articles written by the reporter. Bylines occasionally include a Twitter icon, linking the reporter’s Twitter page. Articles regularly include generic bylines, such as “Daily Mail Reporter.”</p>
<p>Following a conversation with NewsGuard in January 2019, DMG Media added a button at the bottom of the page, linking to the DMG Media website’s “Our leadership team” page. The page features detailed biographical information about DMG Media’s management team, as well as its editors for all publications. NewsGuard has therefore determined that the site now meets its standards for disclosing information about leadership. The Contact Us page features general email addresses, contact forms, telephone numbers, and an address for DMG Media’s offices in London.</p>
<p>The bottom of the site features the disclosure "Published by Associated Newspapers Ltd: Part of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday &#x26; Metro Media Group.” The Copyright statement reads “©dmg media” and links to DMG Media’s website. The Contact Us page also clearly states the website’s ownership information.</p>
<p>Advertisements, sponsored content, and online discounts are generally clearly labeled.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>First published in 1896, the Daily Mail is one of Britain’s most influential and widely read daily newspapers, which The Week attributes to the publication’s “short articles, punchy prose and an editorial lens that put the news in context.” Once notorious for its support of German and Italian fascists, including Adolf Hitler, the Daily Mail now has a Conservative political stance. Under Paul Dacre, who served as the paper’s editor-in-chief from 1992 to August 2018, the Daily Mail has been highly critical of the European Union, and its steady stream of anti-EU articles preceding the Brexit referendum is considered to have had a direct impact on the vote. Geordie Greig succeeded Dacre as editor-in-chief in September 2018.</p>
<p>The Daily Mail’s digital-only counterpart, MailOnline, was launched in 2003. Former editor-in-chief of Fox News Digital Noah Kotch has served as MailOnline’s editor-in-chief since July 2018.</p>
<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label determined that dailymail.co.uk did not regularly correct or clarify errors. After a conversation with IPSO in December 2018 and a review of the site’s corrections policy and procedures, NewsGuard has determined that the site meets the standard for that criterion.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3>Editor’s Note:</h3>
<p>NewsGuard has made changes to the dailymail.co.uk Nutrition Label shown above, which reflect the discussions we have had with a senior Daily Mail news executive who insisted that we not use his name. These discussions began in January 2019 when the senior Daily Mail news executive says he first became aware of our label. The label was published in August 2018, and before that NewsGuard made three separate attempts to get dailymail.co.uk’s comment on what we were drafting, but those efforts were not responded to.</p>
<p>That said, it is our responsibility, not those we write about, to get it right.</p>
<p>This label now has the benefit of the dailymail.co.uk’s input, and our view is that in some important respects their objections are right and we were wrong, which we think demonstrates the value of the transparency and accountability that imbues what we do.</p>
<p>The senior Daily Mail news executive wrote NewsGuard a long, point by point letter summarising the complaints and the views that he expressed in the discussions we had with him. However, he declined to allow us to publish the letter, which is what we would have preferred. Thus, what follows is a review of the points he made in our discussions and in the letter, followed by our reaction to them.</p>
<p>As you will see below, we disagreed with some of the senior Daily Mail news executive’s complaints. But we agreed with some of his points, including that he makes a persuasive case that we were wrong in our assessment that dailymail.co.uk “repeatedly” publishes content that is clearly and significantly false. Please read our explanation for our change of view above. As a result of the change that we are making in our determination of that criteria and one other explained below, as well as a change that the dailymail.co.uk made in its transparency practices following the publication of our original rating, the dailymail.co.uk’s point score (www.newsguardtech.com/ratings/criteria-for-and-explanation-of-ratings.) is now such that it receives an overall rating of green instead of red.</p>
<p>We are glad to have had this dialogue, although, again, we wish we could have had it in advance of our publication. We are also gratified that another important change that we are making that gives the website it higher score is the result of dailymail.co.uk changing one of its key transparency practices to meet the standards we have articulated in our criteria – something that has now happened with more than 500 websites and which is one of the positive results we hoped for when we envisioned NewsGuard.</p>
<p>A summary of the senior Daily Mail news executive’s objections and our explanations for changes we made and did not make are listed below, according to which of the six criteria for which dailymail.co.uk received a negative rating in the original Nutrition Labels:</p>
<p>1.  Repeatedly publishes false news:</p>
<p>The senior Daily Mail news executive complained that we had overstated and relied too heavily on the number of complaints against the Daily Mail, MailOnline, and Mail on Sunday that had been verified by the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), and, in fact, that the newsrooms’ voluntary participation in IPSO’s process was evidence of its dedication to high standards. After reflecting on his comments — and following discussions with some of the U.K.-based journalists whom we are consulting as we prepare to launch in the United Kingdom — we agree. We have changed this rating to green.</p>
<p>We should not be over-relying on IPSO’s process for our judgment on this criterion, nor should we rely as heavily on the number of verified complaints without giving more consideration to the volume of articles published. With that in mind, the senior Daily Mail news executive also stated that dailymail.co.uk published 144,000 articles over the last year. While we do not believe measuring a set percentage of “false” articles is appropriate, some consideration of volume is appropriate when considering whether a website repeatedly publishes content that is clearly and significantly false. Because the content on a website is also cumulative – it does not disappear daily – consideration should also be given to whether the website corrects and/or takes down content discovered to be false. In other words, because NewsGuard is attempting to inform online users of the overall reliability of a website, the best measure of “repeatedly” should include how likely is it that on any given day a reader will see false content. Therefore, NewsGuard has now determined that dailymail.co.uk does not repeatedly publish content that is clearly and significantly false.</p>
<p>2.  Gathers and presents news and information responsibly:</p>
<p>The senior Daily Mail news executive did not address this criterion separately from whether dailymail.co.uk repeatedly publishes false content. His basic argument was that giving the website a demerit on one was the same as giving it a demerit on the other, and that neither was justified. However, there is a difference, which is why these are two separate criteria. As explained above in the Nutrition Label, some of the incidents involving the dailymail.co.uk’s publishing of false stories were highly significant – the false story about Mrs. Trump, for example, or the false story about an apparent terrorist attack in a crowded area of London. And as the label explains, “These incidents, while limited in number given the volume of stories published by the site, are significant in their damaging impact and demonstrate significant misfires in a process that should better ensure the accuracy of stories of this import before they are published to dailymail.co.uk’s vast audience. For this reason, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not consistently meet the standard of gathering and publishing news and information responsibly." Thus, we did not change this rating.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Handles the difference between news and opinion responsibly:</li>
</ol>
<p>The senior Daily Mail news executive objected to our judgment here on the accurate grounds that many newspapers, especially those in the United Kingdom, have long-held politically oriented viewpoints, whether conservative or liberal, and that this is a widely accepted practice in British journalism. He’s right. And the same holds for much of Europe in terms of newspapers – and much of the world in terms of digital-only news websites. However, many such websites disclose their point of view, or agenda, which is one important way NewsGuard determines if they are handling the difference between news and opinion responsibly. Dailymail.co.uk makes no such disclosure of its conservative orientation. See the full definition of this criteria here: www.newsguardtech.com/ratings/criteria-for-and-explanation-of-ratings. We think such disclosure – to people who might be seeing the website on the internet from anywhere in the world and, therefore, might not be familiar with the traditions and pedigree of the website publishing the article they are seeing on a news feed or in a search – is important.</p>
<p>More important, given the tradition of political side-taking in so many European countries that might make dailymail.co.uk’s habit of doing so unexceptional, is the way, as explained in the Nutrition Label, dailymail.co.uk infuses so many other areas of news coverage with high-octane opinion.  For this reason, we did not change our decision about this criterion, although we did expand on our reasoning.</p>
<p>4.  Avoids deceptive headlines:</p>
<p>The senior Daily Mail news executive maintained that the website’s headlines are not deceptive – and that they accurately reflect what is in the ensuing story. After undertaking a new review of the website and considering also the argument that a few arguably deceptive headlines (or at least headlines that overstate the importance of the story) need to be considered against the volume of stories published on dailymail.co.uk, we agree. We made a mistake and have changed the rating.</p>
<p>5.  Reveals who’s in charge, including possible conflicts of interest:</p>
<p>We are glad to report that the senior Daily Mail news executive agreed with this assessment and that as of January 29, 2019 the website had added information about its editorial leadership. Thus, we have changed this rating to green.</p>
<p>6.  The site provides names of content creators, along with either contact or biographical information:</p>
<p>The senior Daily Mail news executive maintained that a news website providing not only a byline but also contact information or biographical information (a basic transparency requirement of the Trust Project [www.thetrustproject.org]) could compromise the safety of his staff. We do not see how providing an email address or basic biographical information summarising the reporter’s professional experience — a widespread practice — would endanger his staff. He also said that NewsGuard did not give a demerit to The Economist for this criteria, although it does not have bylines. The NewsGuard Nutrition Label for economist.com pointed out that although it does not have bylines attached to each article, the site lists names, biographies, and contact information for the editors and reporters responsible for particular areas of coverage and lists the specific beats that they cover, which we think satisfies the transparency standard as defined above.</p>
