It is funded primarily by foundations, including the Ford Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, Lucille Packard Foundation, and Laura and John Arnold Foundation. Funding also comes from reader contributions. Rewire says that it does not accept advertising or corporate donations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site focuses on reproductive and sexual health, and covers what it calls “the intersection of racial, environmental, immigration, and economic justice.” Primary topics include LGBTQ issues, science, politics, law, and policy. News, analysis, commentary, and investigations are written by staff and freelance journalists. They also produce videos, documentaries, and podcasts.</p>\n<p>Podcasts include “Boom! Lawyered,” which focuses on the U.S. Supreme Court. Another podcast, “Choice/Less,” covers teenagers, sex, and abortion law. For example, it examined the impact of state laws that require teenagers to involve a parent or guardian in an abortion decision. “The Breach” podcast covers topics such as taxes and voting rights, and in September 2018 produced a three-part series on pregnancy, drug use, and tribal sovereignty in a rural Montana town. Non-podcast investigations have included how Cincinnati public school students with disabilities do not receive needed services.</p>\n<p>The site includes Legislative Tracker, a database of laws and litigation related to sexual and reproductive health and abortion rights.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>A staff of editors, reporters, and producers, as well as three dozen freelance contributors, create content. Rewire.News is pro-reproductive rights, but stories are well sourced and include original reporting. “We are nonpartisan, but not neutral,” wrote Rewire.News’ president and editor-in-chief Jodi Jacobson in an email to NewsGuard. “We will report on people in any party, any policymaker, law, or organization that flouts evidence in word, deed, or practice.” Rewire.News has partnerships with the University of West Virginia and Indian Country Today, an online site on Native American news, among others.</p>\n<p>Although positions on social issues, such as abortion, transgender and immigration rights, put Rewire.News at odds with the Trump administration, it is not reflexively anti-administration. A 2018 story headlined “Is the U.S. Government Revoking Passports for Trans People? It’s Complicated,” interviewed government officials, as well as a dozen transgender individuals who reported problems in obtaining or renewing passports. It concluded the “bureaucratic hell” transgender individuals go through to get government identification did not signal a new anti-transgender Trump policy at the State Department. Instead, it was a function of “whims and biases” of government employees processing applications, which was “just as true under the Obama administration.”</p>\n<p>The site runs corrections, with an explanation of the error at the top or bottom of the story. It includes updates, which run at the top of the story. Editorials and commentary appear in their own sections.</p>\n<p>A documentary, “Care in Chaos,” won Best Documentary Short at the 2017 Nevada International Film Festival. The site also won the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association’s Excellence in Online Journalism Award for “Cakes for the Klan? Conservatives Craft a Trojan Horse in Supreme Court’s LBGTQ Discrimination.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>All stories carry author names. The About Us section lists all staff members, with name, title, photograph, and links to previous stories and biographies. There are email addresses and Twitter handles for most. Freelance contributors are listed in a Contributors section. Readers can send inquiries through a Contact Us link. It provides an email address for story tips.</p>\n<p>The site discloses its status as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. It lists its board of directors. The site states that it does not accept advertising, corporate donations or money from organizations or advocacy groups, and that it does not endorse any political candidates.</p>\n<p> “We do not serve on boards, our writers do not accept speaking fees, we do not run advertising emails from the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or the Democratic Party. No funder or organization has any role whatsoever in our editorial process, nor does our board,” said Jacobson. Rewire.News has reported critically on Planned Parenthood, including pushback on a staff unionization effort.</p>\n<p>The site posts five years’ of IRS Form 990 tax filings. Although Rewire.News does not provide a list of the foundations that fund it on the site, a list is available on request, “We have not listed these, because we are really small, and until about two years ago, we were all getting death threats and hate mail for the reporting we do on sensitive subjects,” said Jacobson. “Our funders are listed on our 990s, but we didn’t want to make it easy for people to harass them.” She shared a copy of the full 990s with NewsGuard and said the site plans to become part of the Institute for Nonprofit News, a network of about 200 nonprofit newsrooms across the U.S. whose members include ProPublica. Rewire.News plans to list foundation supporters.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Initially known as RH Reality Check, the site launched in 2006 as a blog of the United Nations Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded with a gift from media mogul Ted Turner. It promotes issues set out as important by the UN, such as meeting its Sustainable Development Goals to combat climate change, promoting global health initiatives, and advancing equality for women and girls. The site incorporated and became a registered nonprofit in 2009, was renamed Rewire in 2016 and Rewire.News in 2018.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nKarin Halperin\n\nEdited by:\nJim
