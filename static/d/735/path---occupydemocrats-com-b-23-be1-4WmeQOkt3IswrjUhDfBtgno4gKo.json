(BuzzFeed News reported in August 2017 that Occupy Democrats gets the most weekly engagements on Facebook of any liberal page.) Occupydemocrats.com has not been regularly updated since late 2017, while the Facebook page remains active. A Spanish language version, diariolatinoamericano.com, also continues to post new content.</p>\n<p>Huffington Post reported in August 2016 that most of Occupy Democrats’ advertising income came from its website rather than the Facebook page. In addition to Occupy Democrats, Omar Rivero owns the liberal news website Washington Press and liberal social network Liker. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Occupy Democrats site describes itself as a “political organization and information website that provides a counterbalance to the Republican Tea Party.” Its content is avowedly liberal and often framed with attention-grabbing, emotive headlines designed to entice clicks.</p>\n<p>Articles published on the site in September 2017 included “John Legend Just Gave The Best Response To The Jimmy Kimmel-Trumpcare Controversy,” “Trump Just Told A HUGE Lie About Trumpcare. Obama’s Speechwriter’s Response Is Perfect,” and “The US Attorney Trump Fired Just Launched A New Show And The Promo Is HILARIOUS (WATCH).”</p>\n<p>Sections on the site include Economy, Politics, and Human Rights.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Occupy Democrats stories are often based on inaccurate, partial, or misleading interpretation of its sources, which is why NewsGuard has concluded that it has repeatedly published false information and does not gather and report news responsibly.</p>\n<p>In January 2016, for example, the site ran an article entitled “Virginia Republican Wants Schools To Check Children's Genitals Before Using Bathroom.” Neither the Republican state lawmaker, Mark Cole, nor his bill, HB 663, actually called for such an inspection. Rather, the bill required that restrooms be designated for use by individuals whose anatomical sex matches the gender designation. </p>\n<p>In January 2017, Occupy Democrats posted a story headlined “US Intelligence Just Confirmed Trump Is Being Actively Blackmailed By Russia.” The article concerned the publication of the Steele dossier, which alleges a conspiracy between President Donald Trump and the Russian government. The source for the post was a CNN article that stresses that the dossier contains “allegations,” rather than anything “confirmed.” The CNN article does not mention anything about Trump being “actively blackmailed.”</p>\n<p>Another article, from April 2016, is entitled “IT BEGINS: Watch Cops Drag Girl Out Of NC Bathroom For ‘Not Looking Like A Woman’” and suggests a woman’s removal from a bathroom was linked to the passage of North Carolina’s “bathroom bill.” While the woman in the video does appear to have been removed from a bathroom for her style of dress, fact-checking site Snopes showed definitively that the video that forms the basis of the story was published earlier than the bathroom bill’s passage.</p>\n<p>Although all the above articles were flagged as false by other fact checkers around the time of their publication, none have been corrected, clarified, or retracted. Occupydemocrats.com does publish some clarifications and updates, but because of its regular failure to correct inaccurate stories, NewsGuard has concluded it does not adequately publish corrections.</p>\n<p>Headlines on Occupy Democrats often misrepresent stories. One article from September 2017 entitled “Mike Pence Just Made Up A Fake Thomas Jefferson Quote To Sell Trumpcare On Fox” accuses Pence of lying and “pull[ing] a shady trick” by attributing a quote from Thoreau -- “Government that governs least governs best” -- to Jefferson. This is a clear exaggeration of a mundane misattribution: The quote is regularly, if erroneously, attributed to Jefferson.</p>\n<p>Another article from the same month was headlined “Special Counsel Mueller Just Met With The House Committee In Charge Of Impeachment,” implying the meeting concerned the possible impeachment of President Trump. In fact, Mueller met with only two members of the House Judiciary Committee, and the article itself noted that “It’s unknown what the Special Counsel discussed” with the lawmakers and that “the House Judiciary Committee has an oversight role over Mueller’s activities” as special counsel.</p>\n<p>A headline from May 2017, “FOX News’ Ratings Are PLUMMETING For Downplaying Trump’s Treason,” states a conclusion that is not supported in the article. The story’s source, The Associated Press, does not suggest Fox’s coverage of the Trump administration has caused a ratings decline, instead citing the firing of its most popular personality, Bill O’Reilly.</p>\n<p>Occupy Democrats is an explicitly opinionated website, regularly attacking the Trump presidency and ending articles with a link to a petition demanding Trump’s impeachment. However, the site frequently publishes cherry-picked, misreported information in a highly partisan fashion, as exemplified by the articles cited above. NewsGuard has therefore determined that Occupy Democrats fails to responsibly handle the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the Miami New Times in September 2017, Omar Rivero said that “over 99 percent of our content is 100 percent factual.\" However, an October 2016 analysis by BuzzFeed News found a fifth of posts on Occupy Democrats to be “false or misleading,” making it the “least accurate” liberal Facebook page BuzzFeed analyzed. </p>\n<p>Two NewsGuard emails asking about the site’s corrections policy, use of misleading headlines, and reporting of factually incorrect or distorted information, and its handling of the difference between news and opinion were not answered.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles on Occupy Democrats name their authors and provide contact details. The site discloses that it was founded by the Rivero brothers, but does not explicitly name them as owners. The site’s managing editor, Colin Taylor, is named in his author bio, but a list of the site’s leadership and staff is otherwise unavailable. Advertising is clearly labeled.</p>\n<p>Two NewsGuard emails asking about the site’s lack of transparency about its ownership, leadership, and editorial staff have not been answered.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Miami New Times reported in September 2017 that Occupy Democrats was designed to be a platform that could promote “Occupy Wall Street values” within the Democratic Party. The Occupy movement was a political movement protesting income inequality. It took its name from its strategy of “occupying” public spaces, most notably New York City’s Zuccotti Park.</p>\n<p>In 2016, the owners of liberal Facebook page Addicting Info sued the Rivero brothers, alleging they had been promised 40 percent of Occupy Democrats’ advertising revenue as part of a content sharing agreement. The Riveros denied the claims and a confidential settlement was reached in January 2017.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBron Maher\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Eric
