The site is affiliated with The Daily Caller News Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit created by the founders of the The Daily Caller. The Foundation produces content that it makes available for free to outside news sources, much of which is reproduced on dailycaller.com. A June 2017 Washington Post article flagged this practice, highlighting that, while legal, it enables The Daily Caller to produce content aimed at making a profit while decreasing its tax obligation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Most coverage centers on politics and the media, often featuring stories either favorable to President Trump and conservative causes or unfavorable to liberal politicians and media outlets. For example, articles in July 2018 included “Nancy Pelosi, DCCC Push Blatant Lies In Fundraising Emails,” “Poll: Majority of Democrats Believe A Straight-Up Conspiracy Theory,” and “Donald Trump Jr. Calls Out ‘Weak Republicans’ For ‘Hysteria’ Over Trump’s Economy.” The site also covers business, sports, entertainment, and “guns and gear,” within a section labeled Outdoors.</p>\n<p>In response to an inquiry about whether there is a conservative slant in The Daily Caller’s reporting, which is not explicitly acknowledged on the site, Geoffrey Ingersoll, the site’s Editor in Chief, told NewsGuard, “Our bias is mostly in selection, but we also hold members of the GOP to account as well.” Ingersoll pointed to eight stories, including the July 2018 posts, “Conservative Guest on MSNBC: Trump Has Made The Party ‘Dumber, Crueler, More Dishonest’” and “Maria Butina’s Oligarch ‘Funder’ Identified, And He Has Links To The Trump Campaign.” Ingersoll noted that The Daily Caller never endorses a candidate or explicitly picks sides in elections. </p>\n<p>Content takes the form of articles and videos, compiled through both original interviews and reporting from outside news organizations, such as CNN, Reuters, and Breitbart. The site publishes opinion pieces, generally by conservative columnists, including Ann Coulter. It also publishes content from its fact-checking website, checkyourfact.com, and its gossip website, smokeroom.com</p>\n<p>Stories and headlines often feature inflammatory and sensationalized language, such as the June 2018 stories, “Comedian Eviscerates Dem Hollywood Initiative” and “Trump Demolishes Critics of His Kim Meeting.” Asked about this type of wording, Ingersoll said this phrasing was a byproduct of constant media and politics coverage: “Digital reporters, and this is true of right-of-center, moderate, and left-of-center outlets, who cover soundbites, political snippets, and cable back-and-forths, tend to use this kind of headline construction.”</p>\n<p>The site has two separate shopping sections: The Daily Caller Shop, selling technology and lifestyle products, and The Daily Dealer, featuring sponsored products.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Many articles are fact-based, backing claims with original reporting and outside sourcing. The Daily Caller has a record of breaking news, including a 2016 story revealing the FBI would interview Hillary Clinton about her email practices, and a 2018 piece exposing the man behind the anonymous Twitter account, Sleeping Giants. Most opinion stories appear in a separate section from news content, containing a disclaimer at the bottom of each article that “The views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of The Daily Caller.”</p>\n<p>While much of The Daily Caller’s content meets basic standards of ethical and credible reporting (which is why NewsGuard judged that it generally gathers and presents information responsibly), many stories and headlines distort information in a sensationalized and misleading manner.</p>\n<p>One story, which was challenged by ProPublica, the investigative journalism nonprofit, called into question the responsibility of The Daily Caller’s reporting. Jason Kessler, a white supremacist activist who in August 2017 organized the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, previously wrote three articles for The Daily Caller, in April and May of 2017. One of Kessler’s articles covered a May demonstration by white nationalists in front of the Charlottesville statue of Robert E. Lee, without disclosing that he had participated in the protest. Days after the August 12, 2017, death of Heather Heyer at the Unite the Right rally, Ingersoll, who became editor August 1, 2017, removed all posts by Kessler, without explanation. </p>\n<p>Asked by NewsGuard why the posts were taken down without notice, Ingersoll said that at the time, he had been furious about Kessler’s articles, and deleted them thinking the retraction would speak for itself. He said he was unsure why he did not follow up with a post explaining what had happened, but that if he could go back, he would have written an explanation. He added that The Daily Caller had since improved its vetting process for freelance contributors, and that “one freelancer gone wrong should not define an entire outlet.”</p>\n<p>\"Are we really going to allow 12 or 24 or even 36 posts in an ocean of content to reflect the editorial constitution of an organization?\" Ingersoll asked NewsGuard. \"Aside from being textbook fallacious,\" he continued, \"I think our news and enterprise reporting should be judged in its own right.” NewsGuard agrees, which is why we determined that the site does not repeatedly publish false news and corrects mistakes responsibly, and that it generally gathers and presents news and information responsibly.</p>\n<p>The website has also published content that arguably promotes violence and prejudice. In January 2017, it posted a video compilation of cars pushing liberal protesters out of the way, with the caption “Study the technique; it may prove useful in the next four years.” The video resurfaced after Heyer was struck and killed by a car while counter-protesting white activists at Unite the Right, and was again removed from The Daily Caller without explanation.</p>\n<p>News stories appear with incendiary wording, such as an article that appeared on the homepage in July 2018, with the headline “SCIENCE: Atheists Are More Likely To Rape You.” Clicking the link led to an article with a different headline, “Study: Religion Curbs Sexual Aggression In Men,” which summarized a study published in the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. The study found that college men at one southeastern college who participate in religious activities are less likely to engage in sexually aggressive behavior. The study measured religiosity by frequency of attending religious services, but it did not make direct claims that atheists, as an overall group, were more likely to commit rape. The study also stated that the results could not be generalized to a broader population.</p>\n<p>Another July 25 article, about a plastic straw ban passed in San Francisco, ran with the headline “San Francisco Joins Nationwide Fatwa Against Plastic Straws.” The use of the word “fatwa,” defined by Merriam-Webster as “a legal opinion handed down by an Islamic religious leader,” is a possible reference to the fact that one of the co-sponsors of the ordinance, Supervisor Ahsha Safaì, is Iranian. The article then discussed irrelevant details about a crackdown against knife violence by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, a Muslim whose parents emigrated to the U.K. from Pakistan. Although the article does not explicitly discuss the backgrounds of Safaì or Khan, the decision to invoke Khan’s unrelated action from months earlier, coupled with the choice of the word “fatwa,” imply an anti-Islamic critique. Asked about the word choice, Ingersoll said “we've used the word fatwa before to denote an almost religious zealotry [with reference to] a policy agenda. Same goes with the word ‘jihad,’ that we've used to describe an almost irrational, zealous pursuit of a policy goal.”</p>\n<p>A September 2017 story headlined “NFL Owner Says He Is ‘F<strong>*</strong>g Livid’ At Players Who Protest The National Anthem,” quoted the outrage of an anonymous “NFL owner.” The article did not reveal until its last paragraph, below a photograph, that the “owner” was actually one of more than 360,000 Green Bay Packers “shareholders” who need only pay $250 to receive a certificate symbolically qualifying them a shareholder. Asked by NewsGuard about this, Ingersoll said that “Readers get the joke. Such tongue-in-cheek posts shouldn't be a reflection of our pursuit of otherwise straight-laced journalism.”</p>\n<p>Stories are often warped or cherry-picked to support the ideologies of the authors and the website, such as a July 2018 piece originally headlined “Abortion Groups Claim Abortion Pill Is Totally Safe. Guess They Haven’t Seen The FDA’s Latest Numbers.” The article initially cherry-picked conclusions from a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) study about mifeprex, a pill used to terminate pregnancies, but was rewritten and appended with an Editor’s Note after NewsGuard asked about some of its inaccuracies.</p>\n<p>The original article cited the FDA study, claiming it “shows that 22 women have died in 2018 from taking the abortion pill.” In fact, the study reported that although 22 deaths were “associated” with the pill since it was approved in 2000, “adverse events cannot with certainty be causally attributed to mifepristone because of concurrent use of other drugs, other medical or surgical treatments, co-existing medical conditions, and information gaps about patient health status and clinical management of the patient.” The updated article, with the new headline “Abortion Groups Claim Abortion Pill Is Totally Safe. Here Are The FDA’S Latest Numbers,” now correctly states that the 22 deaths occurred “since the pill was approved,” and now includes the FDA’s caveat about the inability to causally trace the adverse effects to mifeprex. The Daily Caller article still does not mention that the 22 deaths were out of approximately 3.4 million women using the drug since it was approved, representing only 0.0006% of women.</p>\n<p>While The Daily Caller has been recognized for breaking news, it has done so in a way that many would consider a deviation from journalistic norms. For example, a July 2018 article revealed that Matt Rivitz was the man behind Sleeping Giants, an anonymous Twitter account that pressed brands to stop advertising on Breitbart, a conservative news site. In its exclusive report, The Daily Caller published the names and personal information of Rivitz’s wife and friends. The New York Times reported that since the revelation, Rivitz had received “a barrage of threats and harassment.” Ingersoll told NewsGuard that the site typically does not name those close to a subject, but “considering the integral nature of how their digital signature factored in to us [identifying] Mr. Ravitz [sic], I considered it an important admission of evidence to support the thesis.” Ingersoll added that the information was publicly available. </p>\n<p>Dailycaller.com contains a corrections policy, which states that “minor corrections will be noted at the bottom of the article and major factual corrections will be noted at the top.” “I take challenges to our accuracy and credibility with the utmost seriousness,” Ingersoll told NewsGuard. “I have written many updates and corrections since on both sides, so any assertion that we do not correct or update or add editor's notes to articles after the fact is flat out false.”</p>\n<p>Based on the various examples of distortion and cherry picking, NewsGuard concluded that The Daily Caller does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly or avoid deceptive headlines.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site has an About Us page listing the names and email addresses of its editorial and corporate staff. The Contact Us page also provides contact information for general inquiries. Articles name the authors, linking to a profile page with other stories written by them, and sometimes their photograph and Twitter handle. Profiles also provide a link to send writers an email, but in late August 2018 the links rerouted to a story, rather than opening a window with an email address.</p>\n<p>The site discloses that it receives funding through advertisements, but it does not identify the owner(s) of the private company. The site explains that it is connected to The Daily Caller News Foundation, but it does not identify any of the foundation’s donors, which it is not required to do. Ingersoll told NewsGuard: “In a world as divisive as politics and journalism, Foundation leadership opts not to disclose out of concern for their privacy.”</p>\n<p>Advertisements are labeled and distinguished from other articles, and sponsored posts, housed in the “Daily Dealer” section, disclose that “We do have partnerships with affiliates, so The Daily Caller may get a small share of the revenue from any purchase.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Tucker Carlson, a Fox News host, and Neil Patel, former chief policy advisor to Vice President Dick Cheney, founded the site in 2010. Carlson stepped down as editor in chief in 2016, but maintained his ownership stake, while Patel serves as publisher.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n\nEdited by:\nGordon
