Loeb School of Communications, a nonprofit organization that offers journalism classes and workshops. </p>\n<p>Unionleader.com generates income from advertisements and subscription fees. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The website offers fact-based news, sports, politics, business, entertainment, and arts coverage in the Manchester region. On a typical day, the website published stories about police seeking a vandal who painted two swastikas in a Manchester park, parental anger in a school district where fifth-graders were surveyed about their gender identity, and advice to drivers on how to avoid hitting deer. </p>\n<p>The Union Leader publishes national and international news from Reuters, Tribune News Service, and The Washington Post.</p>\n<p>The paper’s opinion section leans conservative. In 2016, it endorsed Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson for president, marking the first time in over a century that it did not endorse a Republican for the nation’s highest office.</p>\n<p>Every four years, when the U.S. president is elected, the newspaper’s coverage of the often-pivotal New Hampshire presidential primary has enormous influence.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Unionleader.com stories attribute information to a variety of reliable sources, including police and government officials, community residents, and experts in their fields. The website posts editorials, cartoons, and labeled columns in a separate opinion section. Headlines accurately represent content.</p>\n<p>In 1997, the paper won a precedent-setting case when the state Supreme Court ruled that private corporations serving a public function are subject to New Hampshire’s Right to Know Law. The decision came from a case in which the newspaper sued to force the New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority to provide documents about a project that was partially financed by the agency.</p>\n<p>The website does not have a posted corrections policy, and NewsGuard could not find visible corrections posted on the site. Carl Perreault, the Union Leader's director of online operations, told NewsGuard that the outlet recently updated its website, and that older articles, including those with corrections, will be re-published when the overhaul is completed.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Names and contact information for Union Leader managers are published on the website. Articles display the names of the authors and  link to email addresses for staff writers.</p>\n<p>The website does not clearly state that it is owned by the Union Leader Corp. and does not mention the Nackey S. Loeb School of Communications. Perreault said the Union Leader is well-known to its readers, and the site discloses its corporate ownership with a legal copyright notice at the bottom of each page. That “makes it pretty clear to the people who've been reading us for the past 100 years,” he said. </p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored content are distinguishable from editorial content. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Union Leader was first published as the Manchester Democrat in 1842, and has existed under names including Manchester Union, Union Democrat, and Manchester Daily Union.</p>\n<p>It took its present name when newspaperman William Loeb purchased it in 1946. Loeb’s widow, Nackey Scripps Loeb, succeeded her husband as publisher of the Union Leader and sister paper, The New Hampshire Sunday News, when he died in 1981.</p>\n<p>Nackey Loeb was a granddaughter of E.W. Scripps, a founder of the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nLillian Childress\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Peggy
