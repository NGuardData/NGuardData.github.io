An About Us page on the site says it is run by “two moms inspired by the life of Andrew Breitbart,” the conservative commentator and founder of the far-right news site Breitbart.com, who died in 2012.</p>\n<p>According to a December 2016 invitation to a Michigan-area Tea Party meeting, the “two moms” are Patty McMurray and Leisa Audette. McMurray and Audette are both Michigan Tea Party activists, and served together as leaders of Red Heels on the Ground, a local Tea Party group.</p>\n<p>The site runs ads and sells merchandise.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard sent questions about the site’s ownership through its Contact Us page, a Facebook message, a Twitter direct message, and email and did not receive a response. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>100PercentFedUp says it is “exposing the lies of the left &#x26; [mainstream media] propagandists.” The site’s editors aim to do this by publishing stories on politics and the culture wars from a conservative perspective. The site groups its content under topic pages labeled Government, Left News, Education, Politics, and Humor.</p>\n<p>The site does not do original reporting. Instead it offers commentary on news from other outlets, including the Daily Caller, Fox, ABC, and Reuters.</p>\n<p>100PercentFedUp publishes articles lifted from other sites. For example, in July 2018 the site published a story copied from DailyMail.com under the headline “CHRISTIAN DOCTOR with 26-yr Medical Career FIRED For Saying ‘People Cannot Choose Their Gender.’”</p>\n<p>100PercentFedUp made no mention that the story was originally published on DailyMail.com except for adding a “Daily Mail” tagline at the end of the post.</p>\n<p>Another July 2018 story with the headline “DELAWARE: MUSLIM ACADEMY STUDENTS Asked To Leave Public Pool After Breaking This One Rule...Principal Outraged” is a copy of a USA Today article. 100percentfedup.com’s article starts with the sentence “Should everyone have to follow the rules of a public pool, or should some people be exempt because they have their own set of rules?” The story then continues “According to USA Today,” and the rest of the story is content taken directly from the USA Today story. </p>\n<p>NewsGuard sent questions to 100PercentFedUp about the site’s practice of copying stories from other outlets through its Contact Us page, a Facebook message, a Twitter direct message, and an email and did not receive a response. </p>\n<p>The banner that runs at the top of all of the site’s pages has a picture of the “two moms” with Andrew Breitbart, though Breitbart never had any affiliation with the site.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard sent questions to 100PercentFedUp about the site’s use of Breitbart’s likeness to promote itself through its Contact Us page, a Facebook message, a Twitter direct message, and an email and did not receive a response. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>100PercentFedUp has a history of publishing misinformation as well as misleading and inaccurate headlines.</p>\n<p>For example, the site published a story in March 2017 with the headline “HORRIBLE! TOP DEMOCRATS Refuse To Stand For Gold Star Widow [Video].” 100PercentFedUp reported that while President Donald Trump honored the widow of Chief Petty Officer William “Ryan” Owens during a 2017 address to Congress, Democrats “sat emotionless refusing to honor the fallen” while Republicans stood and applauded.</p>\n<p>However, footage from the event, including footage the site embedded in the story, showed Democrats standing and applauding for Owens, although not as long as Republicans. Fact-checking sites Snopes.com, Factcheck.org, and Politifact.com all found the claim that Democrats didn’t stand and applaud to be false. As of August 2018, the story had not been corrected.</p>\n<p>A May 2016 story on the site, headlined “London’s New Muslim Mayor Threatens Trump: Allow Muslims Into U.S. Or They Will Attack America,” is an example of the site’s tendency to distort facts. The anonymous author of the story wrote: “How very moderate and tolerant of Sadiq Khan, to make one of his first acts as London’s new Mayor to threaten the United States.” However, what Khan actually said was not a “threat” against the U.S. “Donald Trump's ignorant view of Islam could make both of our countries less safe,” Khan said. “It risks alienating mainstream Muslims around the world and plays into the hands of extremists.” </p>\n<p>100PercentFedUp publishes misleading headlines. For example, a February 2018 headline read “MICHAEL MOORE? Fight Over Man’s Flatulence Forces Flight to Make Emergency Landing [Video].” Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore had nothing to do with the story in question, and was seemingly included to mislead readers into clicking on the article, which began with the words “No, not Michael Moore…” 100PercentFedUp took down the story, without any correction or retraction notice, after NewsGuard sent questions to the site about it. </p>\n<p>NewsGuard could only find one example of the site running a correction, which the site said was in response to a fact check of the story by Factcheck.org.</p>\n<p>100PercentFedUp did not respond to questions about corrections or the stories listed above sent through the site’s Contact Us page, a Facebook message, a Twitter direct message and an email. However, the site added a corrections policy after NewsGuard contacted it.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site does not provide information about its ownership or financing and does not attach author names to stories. The site does not list its editors, managers, or writers. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site was launched in 2012 for Tea Party activists. An archived version of the site from 2012 said “We will be announcing our next rally COMING TO A TOWN NEAR YOU….VERY SOON!” It also asks readers to email the site “if you are interested in hosting a rally in your state.” </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nJosh Keefe&#x26;emsp;Joyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
