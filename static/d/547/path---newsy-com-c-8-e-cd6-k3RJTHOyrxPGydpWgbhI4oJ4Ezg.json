Scripps Company, a Cincinnati-based media company, owns the site. Newsy generates revenue from advertising. Cable providers also pay fees to use the site’s content on their networks.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The website provides videos and four-paragraph summaries of top global news stories, with sections for top headlines, policy, culture, and science/technology. Newsy was founded to produce reporting on national and international news tailored to an audience of 18-34 year-olds, according to the Scripps annual report.</p>\n<p>The site states that it strives to “deliver more – more context, more solutions and greater understanding on the people and events that shape our world,” and to “find answers and put them in perspective so you can make up your own mind.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Newsy operates a staff of more than 70 people out of its six offices in Cincinnati, Columbia, Missouri, Chicago, New York, Denver, and Washington. News stories are generally objective and tend not to stray from the facts, rated “high” in terms of its level of factual reporting from the fact-checking site Media Bias/Fact Check. Stories corroborate information from multiple sources, linking to original sources, where applicable. Headlines reflect the content of stories and videos accurately. If a story does contain an error, Newsy updates the webpage with a correction at the bottom. The site properly attributes photos and video clips to their original sources.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Each story lists the name of its reporter with a link to the staffer’s biography, often including the reporter’s Twitter contact information. The entire Newsy staff is named and pictured on the “team” section of the site. The site discloses who owns it in a section on the bottom. Though the Newsy site itself does not describe how it is financed, Scripps discloses full financing information in its annual report. Advertisements are clearly labeled and differentiated from the site’s journalistic content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Entrepreneur Jim Spencer founded Newsy.com in 2008 after holding high-level positions at Ask Jeeves, AOL, and NBC. The E.W. Scripps Company acquired Newsy in 2014.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newsy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newsy.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-warner/newsycom-the-future-of-mo_b_575271.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-warner/newsycom-the-future-of-mo<em>b</em>575271.html</a></li>\n<li>Scripps 2017 Annual Report</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/external/readwriteweb/2010/05/10/10readwriteweb-missouris-newsy-changes-journalism-on-the-ipa-296.html?ref=technology&src=me\" target=\"_blank\">https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/external/readwriteweb/2010/05/10/10readwriteweb-missouris-newsy-changes-journalism-on-the-ipa-296.html?ref=technology&#x26;src=me</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jim-spencer-88014/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jim-spencer-88014/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2009/09/newsy-the-news-is-broken-but-we-can-fix-it/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wired.com/2009/09/newsy-the-news-is-broken-but-we-can-fix-it/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"newsy.com","author":"Sarah Brandt","date":"2018-07-20T14:05:59.087+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/newsy.com/"}}
