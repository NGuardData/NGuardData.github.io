Gizmodo is part of the media conglomerate Univision Communications, which owns the leading Spanish-language television network in the U.S. </p>\n<p>Deadspin runs a few display ads on its home page. It also generates revenue by featuring  sponsored content, and products from Gizmodo Media’s in-house marketing team, Kinja Deals. Deadspin also sells its own T-shirts and hoodies.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Deadspin’s longtime slogan has been “sports news without access, favor, or discretion.” The site’s writers rarely publish traditional game recaps or standard interviews with athletes. Instead, they publish posts around a specific highlight or a bizarre interaction caught on camera during a broadcast. They also write analyses of teams, trends, and strategies, often using statistics, snark, and profanity to back up their arguments. </p>\n<p>The site also covers off-the-field issues, including advertising, labor relations between athletes and team owners, and the legal troubles of athletes and sports media personalities, often from a pro-labor, anti-corporate perspective. The site also publishes a podcast and some video series.</p>\n<p>The site has some non-sports content, including news from other Gizmodo Media sites, as well as stories that are sports-related, such as a story on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s credit card debts to pay for baseball tickets. </p>\n<p>The staff writes humorous blog posts about non-sports content, sometimes to highlight a viral video or to pick favorite products. Headlines representative of this style include, “Basic Mixed Drinks, Ranked,” “Baseball Jersey Numbers, Ranked,” and “Planets, Ranked.”</p>\n<p>The site’s headlines sometimes contain profanity, usually for humorous purposes, and run misleading, sarcastic headlines for comedic effect. For example, South Korea’s rout of Germany in a World Cup soccer match in 2018 was titled “South Korea Killed Germany And Tossed The Dead Body Out Of The World Cup.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site breaks news and publishes in-depth features. In 2013, the site published an expose demonstrating that the story about Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te’o’s recently deceased girlfriend, which had been widely reported on during that year’s college football season, was a hoax. In 2015, the site published a story showing that “No More,” the nonprofit, anti-domestic violence initiative championed by the NFL, was effectively a marketing campaign that did no real field work. In April 2018, Deadspin’s video editor compiled a video of dozens of anchors at television stations owned by Sinclair Broadcasting reading the same script decrying “one sided news stories plaguing our country.” The video, titled “Sinclair’s Soldiers in Trump’s War on Media,” went viral and prompted widespread coverage and criticism of Sinclair’s editorial policies. </p>\n<p>Deadspin makes corrections. In 2014, the site ran a story alleging that Republican senate candidate Cory Gardner lied about his high school football career. After the main source of the story recanted and Gardner’s campaign produced evidence that he had, in fact, played high school football, Deadspin corrected the story and wrote a follow-up describing how the story was botched. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Deadspin lists all its writers and editors with links to their email addresses and Twitter accounts on an “About” page. The site’s advertising is clearly distinct from editorial content.</p>\n<p>Deadspin has an active comment section and writers usually publicly respond to criticism or questions posted there by readers.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Deadspin was a part of Gawker Media Group from its inception in 2005 to Gawker’s bankruptcy in 2016.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJosh Keefe\n\nEdited
