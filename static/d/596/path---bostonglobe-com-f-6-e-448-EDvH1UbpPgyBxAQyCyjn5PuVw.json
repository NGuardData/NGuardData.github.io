(The Times paid $1.1 billion for the paper in 1993). Bostonglobe.com earns revenue through advertising and subscriptions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Globe covers local and national news, sports, politics, and lifestyles. Local news segments include “Globe Local,” which reports on general news in Massachusetts towns, and “Blotter Tales,” which detail bizarre incidents from police log books in Boston suburbs. The Globe regularly produces multipart investigative features on issues including racism and the Catholic Church. The newspaper also reports on national politics from its Washington bureau.</p>\n<p>Opinion and editorial pieces are generally left-leaning. In the 2016 presidential election, The Globe endorsed Hillary Clinton, writing that Donald Trump would be “unworthy of serving as register of deeds.”</p>\n<p>The “Lifestyle” section publishes news and reviews of restaurants, entertainment, and travel both in New England and around the world. The paper also produces a Boston Globe magazine.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>A robust staff of reporters, columnists, and photographers create content for the Globe.  Headlines on bostonglobe.com are straightforward, factual, and reflect the content in stories. Stories in the Globe regularly feature multiple sources, in-person interviews, and experts.</p>\n<p>The Globe has won 26 Pulitzer Prizes. The paper received international acclaim and a Pulitzer in 2003 for its coverage of the Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal. The reporting led to the resignation of Cardinal Law, the Archbishop emeritus of Boston and  inspired the Oscar-winning movie, “Spotlight.”</p>\n<p>In 2004, the Globe printed graphic photographs that appeared to show U.S. soldiers raping Iraqi women during the Iraq War. Other news organizations had declined to run the photos, believing them to be unverifiable. The Globe ran the photos, and it was quickly discovered that they were from an internet pornography site. The Globe printed an apology and explanation of the mistake.</p>\n<p> In 2018, one the Globe’s prominent columnists, Kevin Cullen, was accused of fabricating  several details in his story about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, claiming that he had been at the scene. In June 2018, he was suspended without pay for three months after a review of his work, and was to return as a general assignment reporter for two months before returning to his role as columnist.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The Globe names the authors of its stories and its editorial and senior staff. Readers can find biographical information about staff and contact them by email, phone, or social media. Opinion pieces are clearly marked as such. All articles include bylines with links to the authors, and often the reporter’s Twitter account, too. The Globe provides a corrections policy and corrections are regularly published both online and in print. Advertising and sponsored content are clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Globe was started by six Boston businessmen in 1872. Boston.com, a precursor of the publications current website, launched in 1995.The site was created in 1998.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2013/08/03/billionaire-red-sox-owner-john-henry-buys-boston-globe-for-70-million-from-new-york-times/#56fa06fa4daa\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2013/08/03/billionaire-red-sox-owner-john-henry-buys-boston-globe-for-70-million-from-new-york-times/#56fa06fa4daa</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/us/boston-globe-newsroom.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/us/boston-globe-newsroom.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/staff/mcgrory\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bostonglobe.com/staff/mcgrory</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/corrections\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bostonglobe.com/corrections</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/businessmain/boston-globe-once-bought-1-1-billion-sells-70-million-6C10835491\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nbcnews.com/businessmain/boston-globe-once-bought-1-1-billion-sells-70-million-6C10835491</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/boston-globe-1\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/boston-globe-1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://deadspin.com/boston-globe-columnist-gets-three-month-unpaid-suspensi-1826924213\" target=\"_blank\">https://deadspin.com/boston-globe-columnist-gets-three-month-unpaid-suspensi-1826924213</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/us/kevin-cullen-boston-globe-suspended.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/us/kevin-cullen-boston-globe-suspended.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/06/15/globe-after-extensive-review-suspends-columnist/SsU32LhLY5s07M3T7HnJcO/story.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/06/15/globe-after-extensive-review-suspends-columnist/SsU32LhLY5s07M3T7HnJcO/story.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/05/14/a_series_of_errors_on_lewd_images/\" target=\"_blank\">http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/editorial<em>opinion/oped/articles/2004/05/14/a</em>series<em>of</em>errors<em>on</em>lewd_images/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/may/14/pressandpublishing.iraq\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/may/14/pressandpublishing.iraq</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/tools/help/stafflist\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bostonglobe.com/tools/help/stafflist</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/corrections\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bostonglobe.com/corrections</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://bostonglobe.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/348/~/boston-globe---corrections-and-comments\" target=\"_blank\">http://bostonglobe.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/348/~/boston-globe---corrections-and-comments</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bostonglobe.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/348/~/boston-globe---corrections-and-comments\" target=\"_blank\">http://bostonglobe.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/348/~/boston-globe---corrections-and-comments</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"bostonglobe.com","author":"Evan Haddad","date":"2018-07-26T22:23:20.049+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/bostonglobe.com/"}}
