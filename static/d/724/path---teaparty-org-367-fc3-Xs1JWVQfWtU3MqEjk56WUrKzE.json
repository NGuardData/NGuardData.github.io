Tea Party Inc. reported approximately $1.5 million in revenue in 2017, all of which came from contributions and grants, according to the organization’s most recent tax filings. The site also runs advertising.</p>\n<p>Steve Eichler is founder, president, and chief executive officer of the organization. Eichler was formerly the executive director of the Minuteman Project, a controversial citizen-activist group, formed in 2004, that patrolled the U.S.-Mexico border to monitor illegal immigration. </p>\n<p>The Tea Party emerged in 2009 not as a centralized political party, but rather as a movement representing a set of beliefs and principles, which generally include a distrust in government and support for lower taxes and tougher immigration controls. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>TeaParty.org states that its mission is “to bring awareness to any issue which challenges the security, sovereignty or domestic tranquility of our beloved nation, The United States of America.” The site publishes dozens of stories daily, often taken from conservative websites. Stories typically advance conservative narratives, providing positive coverage of U.S. President Donald Trump and other Republicans, while criticizing the mainstream media and Democrats.</p>\n<p>A Projects section of the site invites readers to sign petitions with titles such as “Indict Obama Now!” and “Join The Impeachment Defense Team.” Visitors can also register to write blog posts for the site on the Command Center section.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Although TeaParty.org sometimes produces its own stories, the site mostly aggregates content from other sources, including sites that have published false information and promoted conspiracy theories, such as the Gateway Pundit and InfoWars. </p>\n<p>TeaParty.org has republished stories containing false information. On Nov. 1, 2018, the site published a story from Gateway Pundit that contained documents from somebody Gateway described as a “credible witness,” alleging that special counsel Robert Mueller had sexually assaulted her. The documents, which claimed to provide a detailed account of how the alleged assault took place, were uncorroborated, and the story soon fell apart. CNN reported that journalists and “internet sleuths” had connected the documents to conspiracy theorist Jacob Wohl. Hours after publication, Gateway Pundit removed the documents from the site and published an editor’s note saying that it was “currently investigating these accusations.” As of  February 2019, TeaParty.org had not removed the story or documents from its site. </p>\n<p>TeaParty.org also has published stories from InfoWars, run by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones,  that promoted the “QAnon” conspiracy theory, which maintains that Q, an anonymous user who drops cryptic clues in the online message board 4chan, is privy to government secrets related to the Deep State. One story on TeaParty.org maintained that the true identity of Q was “hijacked by the deep state to spread disinformation using his reputation.” Another story claimed that “QAnon has made it clear that whistleblower Edward Snowden has left Russia and is currently in Hong Kong.” Another story repeated QAnon’s suggestions that Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff was being blackmailed for a “death cover-up” and was “concerned he might be implicated in a pedophilia ring.”</p>\n<p>Several news outlets, including the Washington Post and the BBC, have covered the QAnon conspiracies theories and found them to be unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p>Headlines on the site are frequently misleading. For example, in August 2018, TeaParty.org published an article headlined \"Pelosi sinks to new low, tells Dems: if you have to lie to voters to win, do it.\" The article, taken from the Conservative Tribune, referred to an interview now-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave to MSNBC in which she said, “Do whatever you have to do, just win,” but she did not, as the headline states, explicitly tell Democrats to “lie.” After the fact-checking organization PolitiFact challenged the story, the Conservative Tribune changed its original headline and ran a correction. TeaPary.org removed the story as well, but did not issue a correction or retraction notice. </p>\n<p>The TeaParty.Org Exclusives section has run stories under headlines including “PROOF Democrats Paid for RUSSIAN HACKING, Big Conspiracy to Impeach Trump” and “BREAKING: FBI Data Dump Just Exposed Obama’s Nasty Mission To Clear Hillary.” The two stories, like others in the section, do not deliver what the headlines promise — instead soliciting donations and linking to online polls that ask readers questions such as, “is this the biggest witch hunt of our generation?” </p>\n<p>Because TeaParty.org consistently uses content from unreliable sources, publishes false information, and misstates facts to advance its agenda, NewsGuard has determined that it repeatedly publishes false information, does not gather and present information responsibly, and does not responsibly handle the difference between news and opinion. </p>\n<p>TeaParty.org does not articulate a corrections policy. The site sometimes runs corrections on content from other publishers. However, NewsGuard could not find examples of corrections for TeaParty.org’s original stories and blog posts, </p>\n<p>TeaParty.org did not respond to NewsGuard’s two emails seeking comment on its editorial standards, including its publishing of false stories and its approach to corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Although TeaParty.org attributes the stories it takes from other news outlets, the site does not consistently name the authors of its original content. The About Us page names and provides information about the organization’s CEO and lists a general email and mailing address.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<p>The site does not appear to name major donors and therefore does not meet NewsGuard’s standard for nonprofits to disclose details about its ownership and financing.</p>\n<p>TeaParty.org did not respond to three emails from NewsGuard seeking comment on its lack of disclosure about its ownership and content creators. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site was created in 2004, according to its About Us page. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a
