It was founded by venture capitalist John Thornton with $4 million in seed money. According to the site’s Who Funds Us section, The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation has given more than $2.2 million since the site was founded in 2009, while Thornton has given approximately $2 million. Other donors include Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, Walmart, and the Bill &#x26; Melinda Gates Foundation. </p>\n<p>According to 2016 tax documents posted on the site, Texas Tribune collected more than $6.2 million in contributions and grants over the year. Its total revenue was nearly $7 million. </p>\n<p>The site also runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Texas Tribune covers politics and public policy including health care, the economy, energy, the environment, education, immigration, transportation  -- “pretty much every line in the state budget,” the site says in its mission statement. Its state capital bureau in Austin has approximately 15 staffers.</p>\n<p>The site reports on national stories from a Texas perspective. In June 2018, for example, the Tribune analyzed how the retirement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy would affect the Texas Senate race between Republican U.S. Sen.Ted Cruz and Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke.</p>\n<p>As a Texas-based publication, the Tribune in 2018 closely covered the U.S. policy of separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border. A package of stories called “Families Divided” featured in-depth, on-the-ground reporting. That coverage was funded in part by the Pulitzer Center for International Journalism.</p>\n<p>The Tribune has frequently partnered with other not-for-profit journalism outlets. “No Place to Run,” which explored child sex trafficking victims, was produced as an episode of “Reveal,” a podcast and public radio program from the Center for Investigative Reporting. The Peabody Award-winning “Hell and High Water” was published with ProPublica.</p>\n<p>The site is known for its database reporting, which has shed light, for example, on Texas officials’ outside financial interests. TexasTribune.org syndicates its content for free to all media outlets in Texas and has a national partnership with the Washington Post.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Texas Tribune has a corrections page listing all corrections made to published articles, with the story’s date and an explanation of the correction. Headlines are fact-based, and stories are well-sourced.</p>\n<p>In 2018, the site won three national Edward R. Murrow Awards: “Beyond The Wall,” a March 2017 documentary that explored why people were crossing the Mexican-American border; “No Place to Run,” an examination of sex trafficking in Texas; and “Sold Out,” a series that explored the sex trafficking of American children.</p>\n<p>The site won 26 awards for its journalism in 2017, including “Hell and High Water,” a look at the lack of hurricane preparedness in Houston, in partnership with ProPublica, a journalism nonprofit.</p>\n<p>In July 2018, the Texas Tribune announced that it would be partnering with Time magazine for three months to cover the “family separation crisis” on the U.S.-Mexican border. The Tribune stated that its reporters, photographers, and videographers would join Time journalists to report on “the families who continue to cross the border, the near-failed states they’re fleeing, the private prison companies charged with their detention, and the giant smuggling ecosystem that keeps supplying workers and drugs to the American marketplace.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Content creators are clearly listed on each page.  Sponsored content is clearly labeled. The site lists its staff -- editorial and non-editorial -- on a staff page, including the site’s leadership team.</p>\n<p>The site lists everyone who has ever donated to the Texas Tribune, going back to ts founding in 2009. The site says it discloses a company’s donation if it is mentioned in a TexasTribune.org story.</p>\n<p>All of the Tribune’s required funding forms -- including annual reports and audits -- are published on the site. An ethics code also lists the organization’s policies on anonymous sourcing, impartiality, and conflicts of interest.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Thornton founded The Texas Tribune in 2009, and told National Public Radio a year later that he had considered purchasing a for-profit news venture but “came to the conclusion that public service journalism is not a very good business and, in fact, it’s a public good.” He added: “I really did become passionate about this idea that an informed society, a functioning democracy, requires public service journalism.”</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written
