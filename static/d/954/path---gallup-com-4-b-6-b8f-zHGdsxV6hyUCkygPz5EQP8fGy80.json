The website earns revenue from client fees, subscriptions, and product sales. In addition to polling, Gallup sells data and consulting services. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The News section of the site offers dedicated pages for business, politics, world affairs, education, social issues, and the economy. Each page is broken down into subcategories. The tab on social issues, for example, includes 15 subcategories, including abortion, crime, and immigration.</p>\n<p>Articles during summer 2018 included a neutral analysis of Gallup polling about Roe vs. Wade and abortion rights, President Donald Trump’s foreign policy, and the biggest causes of employee burnout. Other articles were pegged to a poll showing an increase in the percentage of parents who feared for their children’s safety in school, and to a poll that measured sentiment about political protesting. “Sixty percent of self-described liberals versus 21 (percent) of conservatives say they have had the urge to demonstrate something,” the article reported, “reflecting underlying approaches to society built into those two ideologies.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Gallup company has a long-established reputation as a professional public-opinion polling organization. The website covers a range of important matters of public policy and culture, through the lens of polling and other data. Stories are written in a neutral manner, without any apparent bias or political spin. A 2018 sampling includes: “More U.S. Commuters Get to Work Without Cars Than in Past,” “Estimating the Risk of Modern Slavery in 2018,” and “Some U.S. Teachers Consider Career Change Over Safety Fears.”</p>\n<p>Gallup posts a corrections policy that includes an email address for readers to report errors. Corrections explain the mistake, and are included as editor’s notes at the bottom of erroneous stories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Gallup.com’s Contact Us page offers general telephone numbers, email addresses, and an electronic message form. Although the site does not have a comprehensive directory for its editorial staff, information about writers is available by clicking on their bylines. Biographies are provided for the editor in chief and other staff members and contributors.</p>\n<p>Gallup.com’s advertisements for its products are clearly distinguished from editorial content. The site does not run ads from other companies.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>George Gallup launched the poll in 1935, and founded the Gallup Organization in 1958. The new company continued to conduct polling but developed a larger market research operation. George Gallup Jr. took over the company from his father in 1966. The Gallup Organization was sold to Selection Research Inc. in 1988. Selective Research was founded by Donald Clifton, who pioneered the use of psychological interviews to identify individual talents.</p>\n<p>The Gallup Poll correctly predicted its first presidential election -- Franklin Roosevelt’s second presidential election victory in 1936. But Gallup’s record has been mixed. The poll incorrectly forecast that Thomas Dewey would defeat Harry Truman in the 1948 presidential election, and in 2012, it got the race between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney wrong as well. After an internal review, Gallup said it would no longer conduct “horse race” polls for the presidential election, opting instead to focus on issues polls.</p>\n<p>The Gallup company was embroiled in scandal in 2012, when the U.S. Justice Department alleged that as a government contractor, Gallup bilked the government out of at least $13 million. The company paid a $10.5 million fine.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note:</em><em> This Nutrition Label has been updated to reflect that Gallup has added a corrections policy to its
