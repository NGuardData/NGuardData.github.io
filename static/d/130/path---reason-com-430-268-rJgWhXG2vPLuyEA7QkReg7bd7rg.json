The foundation is supported by contributions from individuals, foundations, and corporations, as well as event fundraisers. Reason.com is financed with advertising, sponsored content, and user donations. According to its fiscal year 2017 tax filings, Los Angeles-based Reason Foundation collected more than $11.5 million in contributions and grants.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Reason’s tagline is “free minds and free markets,” and the publication describes itself as an “alternative” to liberal and conservative opinion magazines by “making a principled case for liberty and individual choice....”</p>\n<p>Articles primarily cover U.S. government, politics, and culture, with a particular focus on regulatory policy and government spending. In August 2018, some of the site’s top-read articles were titled: “Sorry If You’re Offended, but Socialism Leads to Misery and Destitution” and “As Plastic Straw Bans Gain Momentum, Will Balloons Be Next?”</p>\n<p>At the top of the site, Reason.com has tabs for Reason TV, which produces short documentaries and editorials; its blog called Hit &#x26; Run; and a link for subscribers to find online copies of the print magazine. Reason TV productions sometimes exhibit a mocking or sarcastic tone while providing context from a libertarian perspective about current events. Its video “Desperate Mayors Compete for Amazon HQ2,” for example, includes two fictitious mayors groveling to woo Amazon with offers that included renaming the town after Amazon and $20 billion in kickbacks. </p>\n<p>Reason.com’s home page categorizes online content into five sections that regularly change. These have included Mass Shootings, Surveillance, Donald Trump,  Brett Kavanaugh, FBI, Russia, and College PC. Another section takes users to The Volokh Conspiracy, a blog that was previously published on the Washington Post’s site and includes articles written by lawyers and law professors who are, in the words of The Volokh Conspiracy, “generally libertarian, conservative, centrist, or some mixture.” </p>\n<p>Reason.com has covered the Trump administration in line with its libertarian philosophy. For example, an August 2018 piece titled, “Trump's Ridiculous Military Parade Is Already Three Times Over Budget” began, “The absurd military parade that literally only one person wants to see happen this November will cost an estimated $92 million—more than three times what the White House initially said would be highest possible price tag for the event.” In June 2018, Reason.com published a piece titled, “Trump’s Plan to Privatize the Post Office Deserves a Serious Look.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>For decades, Reason has published work produced by some of the best-known libertarian voices, including author Ayn Rand, economist Milton Friedman, author-economist Thomas Sowell, and more recently, PayPal co-founder and entrepreneur Peter Thiel. The publication has been credited with proposing ideas that later became the basis of new businesses or government initiatives. In 1972, Reason published a piece that provided research arguing for the deregulation of taxis and jitneys, decades before the rise of on-demand, ride-sharing services such as Lyft and Uber.</p>\n<p>In 1971, the magazine published “The case for education vouchers,” which argued in favor of giving families vouchers to use in choosing their children’s schools. “The tax system, by forcing the poor and the middle class to pay for public schools even if they desire to patronize other schools, effectively prices other schools out of the market,” the article says. Reason also gave space to some of the early arguments calling for the deregulation of airlines and privatization of space travel. </p>\n<p>While Reason does cover libertarian candidates and policies more than most media outlets, Reason.com editor-in-chief Katherine Mangu-Ward has said the publication is not a “house organ” for the Libertarian Party. “It’s pretty common for supporters of (2016 Libertarian Party presidential candidate) Gary Johnson, Rand Paul, or others to be mad at various Reason writers on any given day because we’ve critiqued their favorite candidates on some policy issue,” she said in a 2016 Poynter interview with James Warren, who is Executive Editor at NewsGuard. </p>\n<p>Sometimes, Reason.com headlines can express opinions, such as the August 2018 article titled, “In the Feud Between Donald Trump and John Brennan, It’s a Shame They Can’t Both Lose,” but they are usually straightforward and represent the content in articles.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard did not find a corrections policy published on Reason.com but examples of corrections made to stories were found. They are usually published at the bottom of articles saying, “CORRECTION,” with a brief explanation of what was updated.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site is clear about its libertarian viewpoint and discloses its relationship to the Reason Foundation in a Donate section found at the bottom of every page. Reason.com has a Staff section that includes the names and titles of the site’s managing editors and producers, as well as reporters and contributing writers. Email addresses are provided for most of the site’s leadership, and clicking on their names takes readers to their biographies. Advertisements are clearly labeled.</p>\n<p>On the Reason Foundation site, Reason.org, the foundation’s officers and trustees are provided, including billionaire businessman and political donor David Koch, a foundation trustee, who retired from his executive role with Koch Industries in 2018.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Reason was founded as a print magazine by college student Lanny Friedlander in 1968, according to his New York Times obituary in 2011. The print magazine began with a circulation of a few hundred copies, which has increased to nearly 50,000 along with approximately 4 million monthly website visits, according to Reason Foundation’s tax filings.</p>\n<p>Reason.com was created in 1995, and Katherine Mangu-Ward has worked as its editor-in-chief since 2016. Nick Gillespie led the print magazine as editor-in-chief from 2000 to 2008 before becoming editor-in-chief at Reason.com and Reason TV. He is now editor at large for the print magazine.</p>\n<p>In 2014, the magazine made headlines for its cover art that used a database to customize every magazine with a satellite photo of each reader’s neighborhood and their home circled. “Everybody, including our magazine, has been harping on the erosion of privacy and the fears of a database nation,” Gillespie told The New York Times. “It is a totally legit fear. But they make our lives unbelievably easier as well, in terms of commercial transactions, credit, you name it.”  </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nMacaela Bennett\n\nEdited by:\nJim Warren&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Koch brothers' foundation network explained <a href=\"https://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/10/30/18713/koch-brothers-foundation-network-explained\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/10/30/18713/koch-brothers-foundation-network-explained </a></li>\n<li>The Kochs Are Inching Closer to Becoming Media Moguls <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/business/media/koch-brothers-time-meredith.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/business/media/koch-brothers-time-meredith.html </a></li>\n<li>TIME INC.
