Giuda was national coalitions director for Newt Gingrich's 2012 presidential campaign and co-founded TeaParty365, a conservative activist organization based in New York. The website earns revenue through advertising. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>American Military News (AMN) reports on issues related to the U.S. military, foreign affairs, and military lifestyle. Sections feature the latest news from regions of  military interest, including the Korean peninsula and the Middle East. The website also provides coverage of national security issues such as developments on the U.S.-Mexico border, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, and international cyber attacks.</p>\n<p>In addition to original content, the site runs military-related stories from other publications, including Bloomberg News and The Los Angeles Times. Readers can also find news and information related to the various divisions of the military.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site covers military news in a straightforward manner, stating that its “journalistic integrity means that readers will get the facts without bias, ‘interpretation’ or agenda.” American Military News also states that “there are many voices vying for attention in the media today; there are always both critics and supporters of those in power. Our news reporting does not give voice to those making noise for the sake of headlines, nor do we give credence to political fighting, gossip, news-turned-entertainment or the dramatization of news.”</p>\n<p>Although the site mainly publishes even-handed stories about military issues and events, its coverage of non-military topics tends to reflect a partisan view. For example, the site has published stories about former Senator Al Franken and other Democrats involved in sex scandals but has largely ignored similar stories about Republicans. A January 2018 story reported on the 20-year anniversary of the scandal involving President Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. Yet American Military News has not published stories about sexual-assault allegations made against President Trump and did not cover the allegations that nearly derailed the U.S. Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.</p>\n<p>The site states that it covers people who “wield direct power,” but when covering American leaders, story selection can be unbalanced. A search for “President Trump” on the site found only stories with positive headlines, including several based on Trump tweets and quotes from speeches touting his accomplishments. The site’s coverage of prominent Democrats such as President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton often focuses on their political blunders.   </p>\n<p>Opinion and editorial sections are clearly distinguished, but because AMN sometimes presents a one-sided view of non-military news without disclosing its political orientation, NewsGuard has determined that it does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. Asked about the site’s handling of news and opinion, Editor-in-Chief Melissa Leon told NewsGuard in an email: “Our topic coverage is consistent with our mission statement.” </p>\n<p>The site has a record of taking down inaccurate content. In May 2016, for example, it removed from the site an article headlined “Donald Trump sent his own plane to transport 200 stranded marines.” The article relied on a report from conservative commentator and Trump confidante Sean Hannity on Hannity.com, who claimed that in 1991, Trump sent his own plane to rescue U.S. Marines who had been stranded after Operation Desert Storm. The Washington Post in August published a detailed report debunking Hannity’s claim. The Post reported that a Trump-branded plane had picked up the Marines, but the planes were part of the Trump Shuttle service -- which Trump did not own at the time, and which the U.S. military had chartered.</p>\n<p>When the site removed the article, it explained it was doing so due to “multiple corrections and general confusion.”</p>\n<p>AMN’s corrections policy states that AMN regularly fact-checks sources and encourages readers to suggest corrections. AMN told NewsGuard that since the Trump airplane story was taken down in 2016, it has not had to correct any errors.</p>\n<p>The website sources stories from established publications, such as The New York Times and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, but sometimes relies on social media for information. It lists the names of notable figures who have contributed to the publication, including U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo when he was a congressman. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>AMN names editorial and senior staff, including its CEO and editor-in-chief. Articles include the names of the writer. Advertising is clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>AMN launched in 2015.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nJoyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;Eric
