Lisa Sugar is a former ad buyer who started PopSugar as a blog, while Brian Sugar is a former digital media executive. Cinader worked in software development and was a managing editor of the J. Crew catalog. Venture capitalist Michael Moritz of Sequoia Capital is an investor and board member. Lisa Sugar oversees all editorial operations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>PopSugar states its mission is to \"create media that powers the optimism and dreams of women around the world.\" The site offers news on celebrity couples, TV shows, and movies, as well as reviews of beauty and fitness products. PopSugar also covers fitness, fashion, and parenting with workout and eating plans, personal essays on motherhood, and fashion trends.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>In 2018, PopSugar was accused of using photos from bloggers and \"influencers\" without consent and subbing in their own affiliate links. The company took the pages and images down and apologized, saying a feature that had been built during a “hackathon” was left live by mistake. CEO Brian Sugar said the company would return any money it earned from the affiliate links. </p>\n<p>The site does not list a corrections policy; it did not respond to two emails seeking comment about its approach to corrections.</p>\n<p>Headlines accurately reflect the content of articles.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>PopSugar identifies the writer of each post, and provides social media contact information. Readers also can contact the staff through a web form on the site. Sponsored content is marked as \"presented by,\" \"sponsored by\" or \"paid for by.\" Editor’s notes at the bottom of shopping stories state that \"PopSugar often has affiliate partnerships so we may get a share of revenue from your purchase.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Lisa Sugar started the site in 2005. In addition to the website, PopSugar runs a quarterly subscription box service known as PopSugar Must Have and a makeup line called Beauty by PopSugar.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nCrystal Yednak\n\nEdited by:\nJim Warren&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://corp.popsugar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://corp.popsugar.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-himi-lisa-sugar-20161005-snap-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-himi-lisa-sugar-20161005-snap-story.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/author/Lisa-Sugar\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.popsugar.com/author/Lisa-Sugar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/building-an-empire-brian-lisa-sugar-of-popsugar/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/building-an-empire-brian-lisa-sugar-of-popsugar/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/profiles-strategies/2015/01/popsugar-co-founder-on-thered-carpet-karma-and.html?page=all\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/profiles-strategies/2015/01/popsugar-co-founder-on-thered-carpet-karma-and.html?page=all</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/19/17252196/popsugar-instagram-stolen-affiliate-links-photos-rewardstyle-shopstyle-response\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/19/17252196/popsugar-instagram-stolen-affiliate-links-photos-rewardstyle-shopstyle-response</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/TV\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.popsugar.com/TV</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/Movies\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.popsugar.com/Movies</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/HM-x-Moschino-Collection-44748653\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/HM-x-Moschino-Collection-44748653</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"popsugar.com","author":"Crystal Yednak","date":"2018-11-12T20:58:47.997+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/popsugar.com/"}}
