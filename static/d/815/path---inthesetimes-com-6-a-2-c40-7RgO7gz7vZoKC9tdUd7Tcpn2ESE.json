According to its most recent 990 filing with the Internal Revenue Service, In These Times had revenue of nearly $1.9 million in 2016, most of which came from contributions and grants. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>According to Inthesetimes.com’s About page, the site promotes a progressive mission, rooted in the belief that “to thrive, a progressive political movement needs its own media to inform, educate and orient itself.” </p>\n<p>The publication offers original reporting, analysis, and commentary on politics in the U.S., occasionally publishing stories with an international focus. Typical stories cover up-and-coming left-leaning politicians such as New York Congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic Socialist, and political and social issues including immigration, human rights, economic justice, and drug policy. </p>\n<p>The site often covers developments or pursues angles that may be overlooked in the mainstream media, with articles such as “Thousands of Amazon Delivery Drivers Won’t Be Eligible for the $15 Wage,” “The Trucking Industry Is a ‘Sweatshop on Wheels,’” and “Trombones on the Picket Line: Lyric Opera Orchestra on Strike for the First Times in 50 Years.”</p>\n<p>The site features a Labor section, with coverage of issues affecting labor unions and the U.S. workforce, and an Act Locally section focusing on activism at the state and local levels. </p>\n<p>Inthesetimes.com also covers culture from a progressive perspective. For example, a September 2018 article examined misogyny and sexual assault through the lens of Netflix’s adult cartoon series BoJack Horseman. An August 2018 story reviewed an art installment depictingclimate change.  </p>\n<p>A Magazine section of the site publishes articles from print issues of In These Times and allows readers to view the cover image of each edition, dating to 2001.</p>\n<p>Inthesetimes.com solicits submissions of articles focused on corruption and economic injustice, among other issues, with reporting funded by a grant from the Leonard C. Goodman Institute for Investigative Reporting. A Goodman Institute page, linked at the bottom of Inthesetimes.com’s homepage, contains examples of work previously funded by the Institute, including “The Missing Native Vote,” “The Myth of New Orleans' Charter School 'Miracle,’” and “Pregnant Behind Bars.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Although written from a liberal point of view, longform articles on inthesetimes.com are typically deeply reported -- drawing heavily on credible third-party data and research, public records, and interviews with experts and others. Shorter features and columns are usually well-documented as well. Headlines accurately reflect the content in articles.</p>\n<p>Because the site discloses its ideology and does not regularly misstate or distort facts to make its case, NewsGuard has determined that Inthesetimes.com responsibly handles the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<p>The site runs corrections, typically appearing at the bottom of articles. In addition, corrections are sometimes inserted between parentheses within the text. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles include the name of the writer, with a link to a page containing the author’s contact information and a short biography. The site’s About page leads with a mission statement outlining its liberal point of view and agenda. The page also lists the site’s editors, content creators, directors, and other staff, linking to detailed biographies.</p>\n<p>The About page describes the magazine’s history and provides a list of high-profile authors, journalists, and politicians who have written for In These Times, including writer and activist Naomi Klein, Kurt Vonnegut, and one-time Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern.</p>\n<p>A Sponsorship page includes the logos of some of the sites financial supporters, and the About page names all of the site’s founding sponsors. The site does not post an up-to-date list of donors, stating that it now has “thousands” of sponsors, many of whom are individual readers. </p>\n<p>Advertisements are clearly distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Socialist author and historian James Weinstein founded In These Times magazine in 1976 to \"identify and clarify the struggles against corporate power now multiplying in American society,” the site states. Original supporters included Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the trove of Vietnam War documents known as the Pentagon Papers to The New York Times; left-wing intellectual Noam Chomsky; and journalist Barbara Ehrenreich.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJon Allsop\n\nEdited by:\nSarah Brandt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2016/942/889/2016-942889692-0e984d00-9.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2016/942/889/2016-942889692-0e984d00-9.pdf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/about/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/advertise/\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/advertise/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/politics/\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/politics/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/labor/\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/labor/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/act-locally/\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/act-locally/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/investigative/\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/investigative/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/article/16773/the_missing_native_vote\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/article/16773/the<em>missing</em>native_vote</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/culture/\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/culture/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/article/21453/bojack-horseman-season-five-netflix-metoo-weinstein-cosby-mad-men-sopranos\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/article/21453/bojack-horseman-season-five-netflix-metoo-weinstein-cosby-mad-men-sopranos</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/article/21335/climate-change-art-kendler-birds\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/article/21335/climate-change-art-kendler-birds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/archives\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/archives</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/investigative/\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/investigative/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/14198/leaked_confidential_honeywell_document_say_obama_administration_connections\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/14198/leaked<em>confidential</em>honeywell<em>document</em>say<em>obama</em>administration_connections</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/features/ice-abolish-immigration-child-detention-private-prison-profiting.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/features/ice-abolish-immigration-child-detention-private-prison-profiting.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/features/dsa_democratic_socialists_of_america_growth_alexandria-ocasio-cortez-bernie-sanders.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/features/dsa<em>democratic</em>socialists<em>of</em>america<em>growth</em>alexandria-ocasio-cortez-bernie-sanders.html</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/features/janus_supreme_court_unions_investigation.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/features/janus<em>supreme</em>court<em>unions</em>investigation.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/about/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/sponsorship/\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/sponsorship/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/community/profile/322304\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/community/profile/322304</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/contact/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">http://inthesetimes.com/about/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"inthesetimes.com","author":"Jon Allsop","date":"2018-10-24T13:47:38.150+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/inthesetimes.com/"}}
