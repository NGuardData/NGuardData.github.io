Before Pluralist’s launch, the company’s focus had been its platform for fan-created articles on sports which are then published on sites like Sports Illustrated and Yahoo Sports Europe. Advertisements appear on the site.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site focuses on political news largely aggregated from other sources, such as CNN, NBC News, The Daily Beast and the Wall Street Journal. It has also featured or summarized on-air segments and interviews from Fox News and from comedy shows focused on politics, such as Netflix’s “The Break with Michelle Wolf.” Responding to an email from NewsGuard, Pluralist managing editor Juan Leon said the site has done some original reporting, such as an interview with Dan Shapiro, U.S. ambassador to Israel under President Obama. All stories include a video about a recent top story which, however, is often unrelated to the article it accompanies. For example, all stories in early July 2018 led with a video about the resignation of Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>While the site has not been accused of spreading false or misleading information, its most shared stories often paint conservatives and President Donald Trump in a negative light. For example, one article written by editorial intern Steve Barnum about a Washington Post story was headlined “Donald 'Hire American' Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club Wants to Hire 61 Foreigners.” Another story, summarizing a piece from The Atlantic on Trump’s foreign policy, said he was “flouting the expertise of technocrats for the sake of making a splash and letting other nations know who's boss.” The prevalence of stories and headlines like these led NewsGuard to determine that the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>Leon disagreed that the site has a political slant: “The mission of Pluralist is to cover the ideological debate in the United States from a smart non-partisan perspective,” he said.” We aim to call out philosophical inconsistencies and highlight examples of intellectual honesty. As we find our voice, I think you will see these values more clearly reflected in our work.”</p>\n<p>As of June 2018, the site’s staff was small, consisting of the three founding editors along with interns and freelancers tasked with producing “about 10 stories a day,” according to Leon. When asked about making corrections to stories, Leon told NewsGuard its policy would be to disclose corrections at the bottom of the article, but admitted that the site had yet to implement this policy.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Pluralist is inconsistent about identifying content creators. Stories by the site’s founding editors -- Leon, former Huffington Post contributor Adaam James Levin Areddy (cq) and former Jewish Telegraphic Agency reporter Andrew Tobin -- are credited for their work. Many stories, however, are attributed only to Pluralist. In response to an email from NewsGuard, Leon said the website is still under development and editors have “requested a staff page that will feature the masthead and the names of our writers, along with contact information.”</p>\n<p>One section, “Perspectives,” includes opinion pieces and editorials from other sites which are not labeled as opinion on Pluralist. Leon said the site is in “process of getting the capability to add a graphic to our articles that identifies them as opinion before readers click in.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Pluralist.com was launched in 2018.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJohn Gregory\n\nEdited by:\nJim Warren&#x26;emsp;Joyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/PluralistMedia/jobs/626262301057255/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pg/PluralistMedia/jobs/626262301057255/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/90min#section-overview\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/90min#section-overview </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/15/minute-media-raises-17-million-for-sports-and-esports-digital-publishing-platform/\" target=\"_blank\">https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/15/minute-media-raises-17-million-for-sports-and-esports-digital-publishing-platform/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/15/minute-media-nabs-17m-to-expand-its-user-generated-sports-media-platform/\" target=\"_blank\">https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/15/minute-media-nabs-17m-to-expand-its-user-generated-sports-media-platform/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.12up.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.12up.com/ </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.israel21c.org/israeli-sports-platforms-turn-everyone-into-a-sports-journalist/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.israel21c.org/israeli-sports-platforms-turn-everyone-into-a-sports-journalist/ </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pluralist.com/posts/1418-milo-yiannopoulos-tomi-lahren-will-make-secret-cameos-in-anti-abortion-film-roe-v-wade?view_source=channels_page&view_medium=[latest]\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pluralist.com/posts/1418-milo-yiannopoulos-tomi-lahren-will-make-secret-cameos-in-anti-abortion-film-roe-v-wade?view<em>source=channels</em>page&#x26;view_medium=[latest]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pluralist.com/posts/1412-5-wrestlers-say-jim-jordan-knew-about-sex-abuse-trump-is-defending-him?view_source=channels_page&view_medium=[latest]\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pluralist.com/posts/1412-5-wrestlers-say-jim-jordan-knew-about-sex-abuse-trump-is-defending-him?view<em>source=channels</em>page&#x26;view_medium=[latest]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pluralist.com/posts/1406-michael-cohen-isn-t-counting-on-trump-to-pardon-him?view_source=channels_page&view_medium=[latest]\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pluralist.com/posts/1406-michael-cohen-isn-t-counting-on-trump-to-pardon-him?view<em>source=channels</em>page&#x26;view_medium=[latest]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pluralist.com/posts/1399-city-asks-residents-not-to-set-off-fireworks-to-avoid-triggering-parkland-survivors\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pluralist.com/posts/1399-city-asks-residents-not-to-set-off-fireworks-to-avoid-triggering-parkland-survivors </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pluralist.com/posts/637-110-certain-that-trump-will-nix-the-iran-deal-says-ex-israel-envoy\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pluralist.com/posts/637-110-certain-that-trump-will-nix-the-iran-deal-says-ex-israel-envoy </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pluralist.com/posts/945-co-owner-of-the-packers-on-how-the-nfl-is-disgracing-the-true-meaning-of-patriotism\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pluralist.com/posts/945-co-owner-of-the-packers-on-how-the-nfl-is-disgracing-the-true-meaning-of-patriotism </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pluralist.com/posts/1411-donald-hire-american-trump-s-mar-a-lago-club-wants-to-hire-61-foreigners\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pluralist.com/posts/1411-donald-hire-american-trump-s-mar-a-lago-club-wants-to-hire-61-foreigners </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/adaam-james-levin-areddy\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/adaam-james-levin-areddy </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amsterdamlost/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/amsterdamlost/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/andrew-tobin/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/andrew-tobin/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pluralist.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pluralist.com/about </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pluralist.com/posts/1104-white-house-official-defines-the-trump-doctrine-we-re-america-bitch\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pluralist.com/posts/1104-white-house-official-defines-the-trump-doctrine-we-re-america-bitch </a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"pluralist.com","author":"John Gregory","date":"2018-08-07T15:47:50.134+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pluralist.com/"}}
