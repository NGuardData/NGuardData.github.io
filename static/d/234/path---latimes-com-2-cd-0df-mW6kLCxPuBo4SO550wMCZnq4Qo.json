The San Diego Union-Tribune, the Spanish-language Hoy Los Angeles, and a handful of smaller newspapers were also part of the package.</p>\n<p>The website generates revenue from subscriptions, and advertisements, including sponsored content. A limited number of free articles are available before site users are charged for digital subscriptions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>LATimes.com covers local, state, and national and international news, with special sections devoted to California topics. It provides a broad range of local and national political coverage, along with entertainment, sports, science, and technology. The site provides Spanish-language coverage as well, through the section Los Angeles Times en Español. The Times publishes in-depth coverage of California issues of national and international significance, such as earthquakes and wildfires, the environment, immigration, and Hollywood’s entertainment industry.</p>\n<p>Videos and podcasts accompany some stories. National coverage is sometimes supplemented with articles from The Associated Press. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Los Angeles Times quotes reliable sources, including police, government officials, people with firsthand knowledge of events, subject experts, and documents. The Times maintains bureaus in the state capital of Sacramento and Washington. It also has staff reporters stationed around the world in Beijing, Beirut, Mexico City, and Mumbai, India.</p>\n<p>A link to a Corrections section appears at the bottom of the website. Readers can review lists of corrections, which include the date an erroneous story ran and an explanation of the mistake. Contact information for the Times’ readers’ representative is also included, as are correction notes labeled For the Record that run alongside stories</p>\n<p>Editorials, op-ed columns, and readers’ notes are packaged in a separate opinion section. Headlines accurately reflect story content.</p>\n<p>The Times has been operating with a reduced newsroom staff, down to 500 in November 2017 from 1,200 when the paper was at its peak, according to the Columbia Journalism Review, and a revolving door of editors and publishers. Yet it has continued to break big stories and win Pulitzer Prizes.</p>\n<p>The newspaper has won 44 Pulitzers in its history, including 16 during Tronc’s tumultuous ownership. In 2016, it won the Pulitzer for its breaking news coverage of the 2015 terror attack that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. In 2015, it won awards for Mary McNamara’s television and culture criticism and for feature writing for stories on the effects of California’s drought on six communities.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>An About/Contact page includes a masthead listing the owner, executives, and top editors of the Los Angeles Times.</p>\n<p>A staff directory link on the About /Contact page includes a list of editors and reporters. Most people’s names also link to their biographies, and, in the case of reporters and photographers, an archive of their work. In addition, reporters’ biographies and contact information are included at the end of their stories. </p>\n<p>Readers can email news tips and ideas to the Times, as well as reach a readers’ representative to ask questions. </p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored content are distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Los Angeles Times was founded in 1881 as the four-page Los Angeles Daily Times. For more than 100 years, Civil War veteran Col. Harrison Gray Otis and his descendants, the Chandler family, owned and operated the paper, launching latimes.com in 1996.</p>\n<p>Family ownership ended in 2000, when the Chandlers sold the Times Mirror Company to Tribune Co. of Chicago. A series of owners followed, as did financial difficulties that included bankruptcy. Soon-Shiong restored local ownership to the L.A. Times for the first time in more than a decade. He brought in veteran newsman Norman Pearlstine, who held top editorial posts at Time, Bloomberg, and The Wall Street Journal, as executive editor. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nKarin
