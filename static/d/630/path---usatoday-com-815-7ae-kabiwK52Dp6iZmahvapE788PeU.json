Inc., a McLean, Virginia-based chain of more than 100 news organizations around the U.S. Those news properties make up the USA Today Network, which Gannett formed in 2015. Its publications have won numerous awards, including three Pulitzer Prizes in 2018.</p>\n<p>Gannett also owns Newsquest, a company of more than 165 newspaper brands and 40 magazines in the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p>In the U.S. and the U.K., Gannett generates revenue through advertisements and subscriptions for its printed publications, websites, and other digital products.</p>\n<p>The company partners in the U.S. with advertisers to create branded content through its in-house Get Creative studio. Gannett also engages in affiliate marketing, a practice that earns USAToday.com commissions from vendors when customers purchase products through links on the website. The site discloses this arrangement at the top of affiliate-marketing articles.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>USAToday.com publishes national news stories and videos created by USA Today staff, and shares local news stories and videos from other Gannett news organizations. The website has a strong political news section, with separate Washington and Elections sections. In 2018 and the beginning of 2019, the website offered extensive coverage of the federal government shutdown and controversy over the wall proposed for the United States’ southern border. Political articles are interspersed with other news and human interest stories.</p>\n<p>USAToday.com publishes a 50 States section, featuring USA Today’s signature daily roundup of one story from every state. USA Today also creates virtual reality content that allows users to experience 360-degree videos from their computers and smartphones. It occasionally partners with local newsrooms throughout its network to produce in-depth multimedia reporting projects. </p>\n<p>Sections at the top of the website’s homepage include News, Sports, Life, Money, Tech, Travel and Opinion. Its travel section’s coverage of business travel is particularly strong.</p>\n<p>USA Today’s homepage also links to Grateful.co, a cooking and food blogging site that counts Gannett as its majority investor.</p>\n<p>The website publishes content from wire services such as The Associated Press and video content producers, including Buzz60.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The website’s original reporting is straightforward and objective. Stories quote reliable sources, such as police, government officials, people with firsthand knowledge of events, and subject experts.</p>\n<p>The USA Today homepage links to a list of corrections and clarifications, which provide an email address and phone number for users to propose additional corrections. The corrections are also posted at the top of relevant stories. USA Today also links to its “Our Ethical Principles” page from its homepage. Headlines accurately reflect story content.</p>\n<p>In 2018, staffs of the USA Today Network and the Arizona Republic won a Pulitzer Prize for explanatory reporting for a multimedia project called “The Wall,” which used text, photography, video, and audio to explore the southern border of the United States.</p>\n<p>The Cincinnati Enquirer and The Des Moines Register, both members of the USA Today Network, also won Pulitzer Prizes in 2018. The staff of the Enquirer won the local reporting award for coverage of the city’s heroin epidemic, and the Register won for editorial writing about the “damaging consequences” privatizing Medicaid had on poor Iowans.</p>\n<p>In October 2018, USA Today defended its publication of an op-ed column written by President Donald Trump on health care, which declared that Democratic plans to reform health care “would gut Medicare” and lead to health care rationing, statements that were debunked by multiple fact-checking organizations. Some media critics said the newspaper should not have published a column with false information.</p>\n<p>USA Today published a followup article, saying that the publication had fact-checked and edited the column, and that the White House had accepted proposed changes to it before it was published. Editorial page editor Bill Sternberg also wrote in a separate statement, “President Donald Trump’s op-ed was treated like other column submissions; we check  factual assertions while allowing authors  wide leeway to express their opinions.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>An About Us page on the website discloses that Gannett owns USA Today, and it names the president and publisher, as well as the editor in chief. A Staff Index page gives names, photographs and contact information for USA Today’s leadership, editors, reporters, photographers, and designers. The page also provides USA Today’s street address and main telephone number.</p>\n<p>Stories include the names of authors and link to short biographies, which include email addresses and links to social media accounts.</p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored content are distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>USA Today was first published in 1982, when it was viewed as an extraordinary, risky and ultimately successful attempt to create a national general-interest newspaper. The paper was a pioneer in the use of color-coded graphics and brief stories, which have since become commonplace. USAToday.com launched in 1995.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJosh Keefe\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Joyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
