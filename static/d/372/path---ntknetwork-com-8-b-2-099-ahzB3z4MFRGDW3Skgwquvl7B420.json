Trademarks for “NTK Network” and “NTK” -- NTK stands for “Need To Know” -- are listed as owned by Pounder Inc. In December 2017, The New York Times reported that NTK Network shares office space in Arlington, Virginia, with America Rising LLC and Definers Public Affairs.</p>\n<p>The site runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>NTK Network describes itself as a “news website that brings together data points from all platforms to tell the whole story.”</p>\n<p>Sections include Politics, Business, Life, World, and Polls. However, articles in every section relate to politics. For example, the Life section includes articles such as “3 New Polls Show Taylor Swift’s U.S. Senate Candidate Trailing Republican;” “The Worst NYT Columns of the Week;”  and “Report: Twitter ‘Shadow Banning’ Conservative Voices.”</p>\n<p>The Business section’s offerings include “America Has the World’s Most Competitive Economy;” “Why 3 House Democrats Voted for ‘Tax Cuts 2.0;’” and “Liberal Billionaire Complains About NYC Traffic, Tweets Idea to Hike Fares.” The Polls section tracks U.S. Senate, House, and gubernatorial races from sources such as CBS News, the Quinnipiac University Poll, and CNN.</p>\n<p>The site also publishes “NKT Fact Checks,” which mostly check claims made by Democratic politicians.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>NTK Network articles generally do not rely on original reporting, but credit and link to third-party news sources, such as NBC, the Financial Times, The Daily Mail, and The New York Times. Articles, which often include embedded video and social media posts, are generally fact-based and rely on credible sources and polls. Headlines accurately reflect content.</p>\n<p>However, despite its stated dedication to report all “angles” so that “readers have a complete understanding of what is happening,” the site has consistently published news stories that present Democrats in a negative light. NTK also published dozens of articles in 2017 and 2018 that were critical of Apple and Google, at the behest of Facebook, The New York Times reported on Nov. 14, 2018.</p>\n<p>In a lengthy report on Facebook’s internal struggles to handle the fallout over the platform’s role in the spread of misinformation and the Russian manipulation of Facebook during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, the Times reported that Facebook hired NTK’s owner, Definers Affairs, in October 2017 to conduct and promote opposition research on companies and individuals it perceived as rivals. Articles presented Google and Apple in a negative light and played down Russians’ use of Facebook. </p>\n<p>On Nov. 15, 2018, Facebook terminated its work with Definers, the Times reported. An unnamed Facebook spokesperson told the Times: “It is wrong to suggest that we have ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebook’s behalf, or communicate anything untrue.”</p>\n<p>Because the site was apparently used to promote Facebook’s interests without disclosing that to users, NewsGuard has determined that it does not gather and report news responsibly.</p>\n<p>News stories on the site that are openly critical of Democrats include, “Joe Biden, Democrats Top 2020 Pick, Admits He is an Old Man;” “Pennsylvania Democrat Caught on Tape: Dogs Are Smarter Than Police;” “Obama Blames Bush for His Economy, Takes Credit for Trump’s;” and “Hillary Clinton Won’t Go Away, and Democrats Don’t Know How to Make Her.” NewsGuard was unable to find examples of similarly negative coverage of Republican politicians.</p>\n<p>Most articles that report on polls show Republican candidates leading their Democratic opponents. For example, articles published between October 25 and November 1, 2018, included “Fox News’ Round of 5 Senate Polls is Good News for the GOP;” “Cruz Maintains Strong Lead Over O’Rourke in Latest Texas Poll;” and “New Poll Has Abrams Trailing Kemp in Georgia’s Governor Race.”</p>\n<p>All these articles are accurate, but the site does not typically report on polls that show Democrats ahead, and when it does, it adds some pro-Republican spin. For example, the article “New Poll: John James Cuts Stabenow’s Lead in MI-Sen. From 23 Points to 7,” speculates about whether Republican John James’ “last-minute surge” will be “enough to spur an upset” of veteran Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow in Michigan.</p>\n<p>Because the site does not acknowledge an agenda and cherry picks stories and facts to advance its point of view, NewsGuard has determined that NTK Network does not responsibly handle the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<p>The site does not have a stated corrections policy, and NewsGuard was unable to find examples of published corrections.</p>\n<p>NKT Network did not respond to two NewsGuard messages submitted through its contact form asking about the site’s handling of opinion and its corrections policy. NewsGuard also did not receive responses to messages sent to America Rising and Definers Public Affairs through general contact forms on their respective websites. The site did not respond to a separate message seeking comment on the Times’ article and on NewsGuard’s determination that it does not gather and present news responsibly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles generally do not identify the writer, featuring only a “NTK staff” byline. The site’s About Us page names the site’s editor in chief, managing editor, and political editors, as well as the editors’ Twitter handles.</p>\n<p>The site does not disclose its ownership. The page that identifies Pounder as editor in chief does not disclose Pounder’s affiliation, and potential conflicts of interest, with America Rising LLC, although his biographies on the other firm’s websites describe his work with Republicans.</p>\n<p>The website’s Contact Us page features a form through which readers can submit feedback and questions.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are clearly distinguished from news content.</p>\n<p>NKT Network did not respond to two NewsGuard messages submitted through its contact form asking about the site’s lack of information about ownership and content creators. NewsGuard also did not receive responses to messages sent to America Rising and Definers Public Affairs through general contact forms on their respective websites.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>NTK Network was co-founded in 2016 by Joe Pounder and other members of America Rising. The website’s domain was registered in April 2016. Pounder formerly served as research director of the Republican National Committee and worked on the presidential campaigns of Republicans Marco Rubio, Mitt Romney, and John McCain.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: Upon further review, and in light of information reported by The New York Times in November 2018 and reflected in this Nutrition Label, NewsGuard determined that NTK Network does not gather and present news and information responsibly.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric
