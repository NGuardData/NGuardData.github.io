When FreeTelegraph.com launched in August 2017, it did not include any disclosure about the Republican Governors Association’s role. A notation that the site is “Paid for by Republican Governors Association” was added a month later, following reports revealing that it ran the site.</p>\n<p>According to the Republican Governors Association’s 2016 federal filings, top donors to the association included: luxury hotel and casino operator Las Vegas Sands; health insurance provider Blue Cross Blue Shield; Koch Industries, whose owners Charles and David Koch frequently contribute to  conservative causes; and Mountaire Farms, one of the largest chicken producers in the U.S. </p>\n<p>Occasionally, content on the site is paid for by political advocacy groups other than the Republicans Governors Association, according to notes at the bottom of articles.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site’s About section says it is a “conservative news and commentary platform,” adding: “We strive to cover state-wide political issues like no other, getting you the stories you need to know to stay informed.” Sections include Top Stories, Politics, Budget and Taxes, Ethics, and Education. Most coverage centers on U.S. governors and gubernatorial candidates. </p>\n<p>Articles are composed of quotes taken from local and regional news publications, such as The Oklahoman and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, with commentary sometimes added at the end of articles. The commentary is mainly reproduced from conservative news sites including The Blaze, Daily Caller, and Washington Free Beacon. </p>\n<p>The Free Telegraph shares its content on social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter, on which it had a combined following of nearly 200,000 in October 2018. Those social media feeds — the primary place readers access its content — do not disclose the Republican Governors Association’s ownership of the Free Telegraph.</p>\n<p> <strong>Credibility</strong> </p>\n<p>The site does not produce original reporting. Instead, many articles are either based on, or are copies of, articles published on the Republican Governors Association's main website, RGA.org. RGA.org’s articles are not published with author names, so it is unclear who creates the content on FreeTelegraph.com. A handful of Free Telegraph articles have been sponsored by pro-Republican political groups including RGA Nevada PAC and Right Direction Wisconsin PAC.</p>\n<p>The Free Telegraph is pro-Republican in its story selection — consistent with the Republican Governors Association’s mission of “electing and supporting Republican governors,” but not apparent in the mission statement of FreeTelegraph.com. On a single day in October 2018, top headlines on the homepage included: “Colorado Democrat Jared Polis Continues To Excuse Violence Against Women;” “During First Debate, Fred Hubbell Misleads Iowans About His Tax Hike Plan;” and “New Report: Oklahoma Dem Gov Nominee Drew Edmondson Says DUI Offenders Should Not Be Eligible For Jail Time.” All three stories focused on criticisms of Democratic governors or gubernatorial candidates. </p>\n<p>Articles about Republicans emphasize the positive, such as “GOP Governor Pete Ricketts Fights For Tax Relief, Education Reform In Nebraska,” “WSJ: Republican Bob Stefanowski Has GOP On Offense In Connecticut,” and “Weekly Standard: Will Oregon Be The Next Blue State With A Republican Governor?”</p>\n<p>Although the site’s articles are generally based on verifiable information, headlines do not always represent the factual information in the articles.</p>\n<p>For example, in October 2018, the site ran an article headlined, ““Sh*thole,’ ‘Uh-Oh State,’ ‘Nutty,’ – Andrew Gillum’s Campaign Keeps Insulting Floridians.” The headline asserts that the campaign of Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum used all those phrases, but the phrase containing the profanity was attributed in the original source to a Gillum supporter, not a surrogate.</p>\n<p>An April 2018 article titled, “Top DGA Fundraiser Nancy Pelosi Says Dems Will Reverse Pay Raises, End Bonuses,” states as a certainty something that is far from apparent. The article concerns Democratic efforts to reverse the Republican tax cuts, but it is a leap to say Democrats want to “reverse” pay hikes in the private sector that some have attributed to lower taxes for businesses. </p>\n<p>FreeTelegraph.com does not articulate a corrections policy, nor could NewsGuard find examples of corrections.</p>\n<p>Because FreeTelegraph.com is not clear about its agenda or ownership, runs misleading headlines, does not issue corrections, and does not reveal anything about who is creating the content on the site, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not meet the standard for gathering and presenting information responsibly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>FreeTelegraph.com discloses both at the bottom of articles and in an About section that the site is “sponsored by” and “made possible through the generous support of the Republican Governors Association” — but it does not state that it is owned and run by the Republican Governors Association. </p>\n<p>When FreeTelegraph.com launched in August 2017, it did not include any disclosure about its connection to the Republican Governors Association. Sometime between the launch and Sept. 19, 2017, a disclosure about the Republican Governors Association was added, according to internet archives. (The Associated Press published an article revealing the site’s ownership on Sept. 19.)</p>\n<p>Asked in February 2018 about the site’s disclosure, Republican Governors Association spokesman Jon Thompson told Politico that the phrase “Sponsored by the Republican Governors Association” was added to the bottom of articles because it guaranteed greater visibility than merely placing the disclosure at the bottom of its homepage — since most readers access the site through individual articles rather than the homepage.</p>\n<p>However, in NewsGuard’s judgement, stating that the site is “Sponsored by the Republican Governors Association” is not the same as disclosing ownership. After all, many sites have sponsors who play no role in the editorial process.</p>\n<p>The site does not disclose any information about its editorial staff, including site leaders and content creators. There is also no contact information provided on FreeTelegraph.com.</p>\n<p>The Free Telegraph did not respond to NewsGuard’s questions, sent through Facebook messenger to the publication’s related page, about the Free Telegraph’s editorial practices, approach to corrections, headlines, and lack of transparency about its ownership, leadership, and content creators.</p>\n<p>The site does not run advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The domain freetelegraph.com was registered in July 2017 and internet archives show the site began publishing articles in the next few weeks.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nMacaela Bennett\n\nEdited by:\nKendrick McDonald&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>About section <a href=\"https://freetelegraph.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\">https://freetelegraph.com/signup/ </a></li>\n<li>Republican Governors Association <a href=\"https://www.rga.org/about/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.rga.org/about/ </a></li>\n<li>Republican Governors Association 2016 donors <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail_contribs.php?ein=113655877&cycle=2016\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail_contribs.php?ein=113655877&#x26;cycle=2016 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail_expends.php?ein=113655877&cycle=2016\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail_expends.php?ein=113655877&#x26;cycle=2016 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mountaire.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">https://mountaire.com/about/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bcbs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bcbs.com/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sands.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sands.com/ </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kochind.com/whatwedo/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.kochind.com/whatwedo/ </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li>New Report: Oklahoma Dem Gov Nominee Drew Edmondson Used Campaign Funds For Luxury Vacation <a href=\"https://freetelegraph.com/new-report-oklahoma-dem-gov-nominee-drew-edmondson-used-campaign-funds-luxury-vacation/\" target=\"_blank\">https://freetelegraph.com/new-report-oklahoma-dem-gov-nominee-drew-edmondson-used-campaign-funds-luxury-vacation/ </a></li>\n<li>During First Debate, Fred Hubbell Misleads Iowans About His Tax Hike Plans <a href=\"https://freetelegraph.com/during-first-debate-fred-hubbell-misleads-iowans-about-his-tax-hike-plans/\" target=\"_blank\">https://freetelegraph.com/during-first-debate-fred-hubbell-misleads-iowans-about-his-tax-hike-plans/ </a></li>\n<li>What They Are Saying: Democrat Stacey Abrams Faces Criticism After Admitting Illegal Immigrants Are Supporting Her Campaign <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20181017130544/https://freetelegraph.com/democrat-stacey-abrams-faces-criticism-after-admitting-illegal-immigrants-are-supporting-her-campaign/\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.archive.org/web/20181017130544/https://freetelegraph.com/democrat-stacey-abrams-faces-criticism-after-admitting-illegal-immigrants-are-supporting-her-campaign/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20181017130547/https://www.rga.org/saying-democrat-stacey-abrams-faces-criticism-admitting-illegal-immigrants-supporting-campaign/\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.archive.org/web/20181017130547/https://www.rga.org/saying-democrat-stacey-abrams-faces-criticism-admitting-illegal-immigrants-supporting-campaign/ </a></li>\n<li>With One Tweet, Melania Trump Shuts Down The Media <a href=\"https://freetelegraph.com/one-tweet-melania-trump-shuts-down-media/\" target=\"_blank\">https://freetelegraph.com/one-tweet-melania-trump-shuts-down-media/ </a></li>\n<li>Jared Polis Wants To Turn Colorado Into California?
