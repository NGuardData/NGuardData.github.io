However, PuppetStringNews.com is registered under his name, and photographs on the Puppet String News’ Facebook page match photos of Petersen that are published on his personal Facebook page.</p>\n<p>The site says only that it was founded by an anonymous “US NAVY vet, who served four years in the military, got out because he was tired of the world and it's (sic) current state.”</p>\n<p>Puppet String News runs a small amount of programmatic ads and solicits donations through a PayPal account.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Puppet String News publishes U.S. political stories from a far-right perspective, promoting conspiracy theories on major news of the day. The site often covers controversies that appeal to conservatives, such as a group of Central American migrants traveling to the U.S.-Mexico border, and efforts to stop illegal voting during U.S. elections.</p>\n<p>The site’s author describes his purpose on an About page stating, “Decided to get into alternative news to tell the truth to best of ability,” without disclosing a political point of view. The site publishes a running news feed, with stories that are typically a few paragraphs long and embedding videos and tweets. The unbylined stories do not contain original reporting, and instead insert commentary on reporting by other news outlets, such as Fox News, Breitbart, and The Gateway Pundit, or viral social media posts.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Puppet String News has repeatedly published false information and promoted conspiracy theories without evidence. Several stories on the site advance a debunked conspiracy theory that President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton have orchestrated the deaths of various figures distantly connected to them or their nonprofit foundation. In July 2018, for example, the site published a story claiming that two New Jersey citizens who died when an explosion occurred in their home, “were set to testify against the Clinton's (sic) to a Grand Jury this week sometime.” The writer stated as fact unfounded rumors that originated on the websites 4chan and 8chan and added, “we have more lives to add to the Clinton body count.” The independent fact-checking website Snopes debunked the false report. Local officials found no evidence of foul play in the explosion, which was caused by natural gas.</p>\n<p>Another story published in October 2018 cast doubt on the cause of a mass shooting that occurred at a Pittsburgh synagogue, killing 11 people and wounding six others. Without evidence, the author speculated, “it absolutely now feels that this shooting was Deep State organized...Because why would the casualty total be the date of the 2018 midterm election?”</p>\n<p>The site also published false claims about the group of thousands of Central American migrants traveling to the U.S.-Mexico border, often referred to as the “caravan,” in October and November 2018. In a story titled, “UN behind caravan, tells America to stand down to the caravan,” the site distorted comments from a United Nations special investigator on the human rights of migrants, who stated that the U.S. should consider the rights of individual migrants rather than taking collective action against them.</p>\n<p>Puppet String News reported instead that “the UN is basically telling America along with Mexico to stand down,” and falsely reported that billionaire philanthropist George Soros was funding the caravan, stating that “we obviously have Soros and his organizations behind this caravan.” In a separate story, the site referenced unspecified “documents” and repeated the  false claim that “we already know that the United Nations and Soros are working in tandem to flood America with these caravan invaders.”</p>\n<p>Puppet String News published several stories on Nov. 6, 2018, that misled users about voting procedures at some polling places in the U.S. midterm elections. One such story reported, “This can't be legal, Drop boxes for ballots being used in Oregon for midterms.” Drop boxes are part of the state’s official electoral voting system and are in fact legal. Regardless, the author assumes that, “This basically means that anyone can vote in the state of Oregon from illegals to kids, because technically anyone at these drop boxes being used in Oregon can drop in a ballot for the 2018 midterms.”</p>\n<p>Puppet String News has based many of its stories on the accounts of news sources that have been known to publish false information, including The Gateway Pundit, WND.com, and the pro-Russia site ZeroHedge.com. Stories on the site are not labeled as opinion and egregiously distort information to promote a far-right, conspiratorial viewpoint.</p>\n<p>The site publishes misleading headlines that perpetuate unfounded claims. For example, in November 2018 the site published the headline “UN/Soros funded caravan involves middle east refugees, DHS secretary confirms after intel brief.” There is no evidence that Soros, a frequent target of far-right and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, funded the migrant caravan. Another November 2018 headline said, “Former Obama Campaign staffer arrested for vandalizing Jewish Synagogues.” The suspect had worked as a volunteer, not a staffer, for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>The site does not run corrections. Puppet String News’ repeated publication of false content that has not been corrected, as well as questionably sourced stories that advance far-right conspiracy theories, has led NewsGuard to determine it does not gather and present information responsibly, or handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>Petersen did not respond to NewsGuard’s emailed questions seeking comment about the site’s history of publishing misinformation in headlines and articles, but instead sent a screenshot of a Media Resource Center release titled “Top Journalists that Serve on Soros-Funded Boards of Directors or Advisers.” The conservative media criticism group identifies NewsGuard co-CEO Gordon Crovitz as a member of an advisory board to nonprofit news organization ProPublica, which does receive funding from Soros’ Open Society Foundations. </p>\n<p>Peterson wrote, “HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. So you're another Soros version of Snopes,” in a reference to the fact-checking organization Snopes.com. He did not respond to an additional email that reiterated NewsGuard’s questions about the site.</p>\n<p>Soros is not an investor in NewsGuard. The full list of NewsGuard’s actual investors is available on the NewsGuard website: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.newsguardtech.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1541695293189000\" style=\"color:inherit;text-decoration:inherit\">www.newsguardtech.com</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site does not provide information about its ownership or leadership, other than stating that the site was created by a “US NAVY vet.” The site does not list authors of individual stories. The site’s few advertisements are clearly differentiated from editorial content.</p>\n<p>Petersen responded to NewsGuard’s inquiries about the site’s disclosure of ownership and content creators with an email that implied NewsGuard was funded by Soros. He did not respond to an additional email that reiterated NewsGuard’s questions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The domain was registered in February 2016, according to the Internet Corporation of
