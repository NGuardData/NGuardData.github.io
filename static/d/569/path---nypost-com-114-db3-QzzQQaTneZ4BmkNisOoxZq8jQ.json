The site generates revenue through advertisements.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>NYPost.com publishes articles and videos about local news, politics, sports, real estate, and technology. The paper’s well-known Page Six section features news and gossip about celebrities and New York City’s entertainment scene. Content from Page Six, which also has its own dedicated website, is prominent on the site. The site publishes a fashion and lifestyle section called Alexa, and runs national and international news from The Associated Press and Reuters.</p>\n<p>Stories are typically written in a punchy, light-hearted style. For example, a story about New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio spending a weekend at Bernie Sanders’ summer home opens with, “Well, at least it didn’t involve a dead guy,” a reference to the film “Weekend at Bernie’s.”</p>\n<p>The paper’s front page has a reputation for featuring provocative, over-the-top headlines. In May 2018, a visit to the White House by reality TV star Kim Kardashian was given the headline, “Trump Meets Rump,” a reference to Kardashian’s backside. Most famously, a 1983 article about a grisly murder was headlined, “Headless Body In Topless Bar.” Similar to other outlets controlled by Murdoch, the Post’s editorials and columnists skew conservative.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles are generally fact-based, include original reporting and often tout exclusive news on city government, celebrities and media personalities, and local crime. Some stories are based on reporting by other outlets and from social media posts. Its noted columnists include Michael Goodwin, John Podhoretz, and famed gossip columnist Cindy Adams.</p>\n<p>The paper faced criticism and a lawsuit for running a photo of two men it implied were suspects in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. The photo of two unidentified men near the scene of the explosion ran with the headline “Bag Men” and the subhead “Feds seek these two pictured at Boston Marathon.” </p>\n<p>The men were quickly identified and cleared by investigators, which the Post also reported. Editor Col Allan said in a statement at the time that the Post accurately reported that law enforcement agencies were seeking information about the men and never called them suspects.</p>\n<p>The men pictured by the Post sued the paper for defamation in June 2013. The suit was settled in 2014 for an undisclosed sum.</p>\n<p>The Post sometimes relies on unnamed “sources,” without further identifying them, to back up some of its exclusives, frequently on its Page Six gossip section.</p>\n<p>In 2006, a contributor and gossip columnist for Page Six, Jared Paul Stern, became the subject of a federal extortion investigation. Stern was accused of demanding payments from Ronald Burkle, a supermarket magnate and investor, to keep negative stories out of the newspaper. The Post removed Stern from the paper, describing him as “a rogue former freelancer” and “a disgraced journalist” after Stern threatened a lawsuit against the paper in 2007. Stern was not charged by federal prosecutors. After the incident, the Post said it would reduce its use of freelance gossip contributors, Variety and The New York Times reported.  </p>\n<p>The Post’s reporting has won awards, including state-level prizes from The Associated Press for several of its stories in 2017. One such report focused on sexual misconduct allegations against ex-Metropolitan Opera conductor James Levine. Reporting about a city initiative to improve struggling schools and hazing allegations within the the city’s fire department garnered two public service awards. The paper also won an AP award for business writing involving the financing of the Brooklyn home of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.</p>\n<p>The Post’s editorials are clearly labeled. No corrections policy is listed on the website. Some stories are marked as updated, but without details about what information is new or corrected.</p>\n<p>Two emails and two voicemails left for the Post’s Chief Digital Officer Remy Stern, and two emails to the Post’s newsroom seeking comment about its approach to corrections went unanswered. An additional email sent both to Stern and editor-in-chief Stephen Lynch seeking comment about the Post’s use of unnamed sources was also not returned.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Stories on NYPost.com regularly include the author’s name. Clicking on the name prompts a message box to appear allowing visitors to reach the story’s writer, although the feature is not available for all writers. Information to contact the newsroom is posted on the website, but names of most senior and mid-level managers do not appear on the site’s Contacts page.</p>\n<p>Two emails and two phone calls to Stern, the Chief Digital Officer, inquiring about how to reach writers and reporters were not answered.</p>\n<p>Sponsored content and ads are clearly labeled on the website.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The New York Post was founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton and is one of the nation’s oldest newspapers. Dorothy Schiff, the granddaughter of a wealthy investment banker purchased the newspaper in 1939 and turned it into a tabloid in 1942. </p>\n<p>Schiff, who became the first female newspaper publisher in New York, helped the Post win eight George Polk Awards between 1949 and 1966 for its local, national, and interpretive reporting. </p>\n<p>By the late 1960s, the Post was the only afternoon daily still published in New York City. After Schiff sold the paper to Rupert Murdoch in 1976, the newspaper added a morning edition and eventually ended its afternoon version. Murdoch added the Page Six gossip column and transformed it into a gritty daily tabloid. He controlled the paper until 1988. As he grew his television holdings in the United States, Murdoch was forced to sell the Post to comply with federal regulations barring cross-ownership of newspapers and television stations in the same city. </p>\n<p>A New York real estate developer bought the paper and ran it for five years until declaring bankruptcy. Murdoch returned to the paper in 1993, after he successfully lobbied federal regulators to keep the Post and his growing group of TV stations. </p>\n<p><em>Disclosure: NewsGuard Analyst Joe
