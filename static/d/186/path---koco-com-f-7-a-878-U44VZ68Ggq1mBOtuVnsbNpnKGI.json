Hearst operates more than 30 television stations around the U.S. and has stakes in other broadcasting companies, such as A+E Networks and ESPN. It also owns a variety of print and digital media ventures.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>KOCO.com features local news, sports, weather, politics, and entertainment stories, written by KOCO reporters, in addition to regional and national stories from external news organizations and The Associated Press. In spring 2018, KOCO regularly provided updates on the walkout by Oklahoma teachers over education funding in the state. The site also features special health sections on State of Addiction, covering the opioid epidemic, and Flu. Readers can post their own content on the “u local” page. The site streams reports from the KOCO television station live as well, and accompanies its articles with many photos and videos.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>A brief corrections policy on KOCO.com says the newsroom will “seek to quickly and thoughtfully acknowledge and address errors,” but NewsGuard could not find recent corrections published on originally reported articles. Tom Campo, a Hearst Television representative, told NewsGuard in a phone interview that all Hearst stations follow the posted statement of editorial guidelines, which includes correcting reporting errors quickly. The guidelines state such stories will include a notation of the correction.</p>\n<p>Articles link to external sources for information and often base reporting on first-person interviews. Headlines are straightforward and editorials are distinguished from news stories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>KOCO.com participates in the Trust Project (thetrustproject.org), in which news organizations commit to follow specific guidelines related to transparency.</p>\n<p>The station provides a list of its on-air journalists, along with their biographies and contact details on the site’s News Team page. However, NewsGuard could not locate similar details for newsroom and station managers. Tom Campo, a Hearst Television representative, acknowledged to NewsGuard in a telephone interview that some Hearst television station websites do not provide information about senior managers, and said that Hearst plans to update their websites to include that information.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>KOCO was founded in 1954 and was acquired by Hearst in its 1997 merger with Argyle Television.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSam Howard\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Joyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/27/business/hearst-to-buy-argyle-tv-in-a-rare-public-venture.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/27/business/hearst-to-buy-argyle-tv-in-a-rare-public-venture.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/tvspy/koco-names-rebecca-gaylord-news-director/98250\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.adweek.com/tvspy/koco-names-rebecca-gaylord-news-director/98250</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hearst.com/newsroom/hearst-television-history\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.hearst.com/newsroom/hearst-television-history</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hearst.com/broadcasting/our-markets\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.hearst.com/broadcasting/our-markets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.koco.com/news-team\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.koco.com/news-team</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.koco.com/weather-blog\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.koco.com/weather-blog</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.koco.com/article/editorial-courage-to-make-hard-decisions-to-fund-education-obviously-not-at-capitol/19710572\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.koco.com/article/editorial-courage-to-make-hard-decisions-to-fund-education-obviously-not-at-capitol/19710572</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=165238\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=165238</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.koco.com/article/woman-says-oklahoma-officers-compassion-helped-her-become-drug-free/22626439\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.koco.com/article/woman-says-oklahoma-officers-compassion-helped-her-become-drug-free/22626439</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.koco.com/article/new-education-funding-plan-proposed-as-walkout-enters-day-8/19743302\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.koco.com/article/new-education-funding-plan-proposed-as-walkout-enters-day-8/19743302</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.koco.com/article/some-oklahoma-schools-to-resume-classes-as-walkout-continues/19746050\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.koco.com/article/some-oklahoma-schools-to-resume-classes-as-walkout-continues/19746050</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.koco.com/article/faith-leaders-family-members-to-gather-on-fourth-day-of-teacher-walkout/19690739\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.koco.com/article/faith-leaders-family-members-to-gather-on-fourth-day-of-teacher-walkout/19690739</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.koco.com/article/teacher-walkout-day-3-students-expected-to-march-into-state-capitol/19681079\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.koco.com/article/teacher-walkout-day-3-students-expected-to-march-into-state-capitol/19681079</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.koco.com/nowcast\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.koco.com/nowcast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hearst.com/newsroom/hearst-and-argyle-join-to-form-new-12-station-television-company\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.hearst.com/newsroom/hearst-and-argyle-join-to-form-new-12-station-television-company</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"koco.com","author":"Sam Howard","date":"2018-11-12T13:23:56.729+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/koco.com/"}}
