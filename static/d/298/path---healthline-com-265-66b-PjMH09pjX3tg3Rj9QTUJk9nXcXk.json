Typical articles on the site include the health benefits of ingredients like charcoal, a primer on what to look for in a midwife, the benefits of working out while wearing a weight vest, how to fight depression, and tips on stretches before bed that can help sleep.</p>\n<p>The articles cite research in peer-reviewed medical and scientific journals. Other articles written by staff members with degrees in medical or nutritional sciences gather evidence from different studies to judge the effectiveness of various health practices and diets, linking to related Healthline articles or to the studies themselves.</p>\n<p>The site features a “symptom checker” listing dozens of possible causes for physical symptoms, and links to 20 online support groups for a range of illnesses and disorders, such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, hepatitis C and diabetes.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Healthline’s site includes its sourcing guidelines, saying it will “only link to reputable media sites, academic research institutions and, whenever possible, medically peer reviewed studies.” Other articles are marked as “evidence based,” typically written by someone with a degree in a medical field or nutrition. </p>\n<p>Some stories written by regular Healthline staff members and contributors are marked as “medically reviewed” by someone with academic credentials in the topic being discussed. For example, an article on depression also identified a psychologist who reviewed the story.</p>\n<p>Headlines accurately reflect content. The site does not have a separate opinion section.</p>\n<p>No corrections policy is listed on Healthline, and no corrections could be found on the website. Two emails and a phone call to Healthline seeking information on its approach to corrections were not returned.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site identifies Healthline Media’s leadership, with links to their respective LinkedIn pages, as well as a generic contact form for users to offer feedback or request corrections.</p>\n<p>Medical reviewers are listed along with staff writers on individual articles, but only medical reviewers are given short biographies. No information is provided about staff writers beyond their name. Healthline did not respond to two emails and a phone call asking where information on individual staff writers could be found. </p>\n<p>Advertising is clearly distinguishable from editorial content, as is sponsored, co-branded or fully branded content. The site does include a detailed advertising and sponsorship policy pledging that “other than input about broad topic areas, we never allow sponsors to influence the content we create.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Healthline was started as YourDoctor.com in 1999, adopting its current name in 2005.</p>\n<p>In 2016, it was spun off from parent company Healthline Network. Healthline Media has since expanded with acquisitions of other medical information sites, such as MedicalNewsToday.com in 2016, and Authority Nutrition in 2017.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJohn
