The site also states that the company is privately owned and has taken no outside funding to date. It appears to rely on advertising revenue.In addition to shareably.net, SBLY owns several other lifestyles websites, including AnimalChannel.co, Relieved.co, and Parentingisnteasy.co.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Sharebly.net describes its mission with a statement on the site’s About page: “We believe that there are stories happening every day that are worth sharing. Our mission is to find and distribute these stories to our readers as effectively as possible. Our hope is that every story you read across SBLY will inspire, inform, or entertain.”</p>\n<p>Stories on the site are primarily positive, uplifting articles that appear to have originally been shared on social media or by other news outlets. Articles found on the site on August 27, 2018 include “Teen Runaway Resurfaces after 5 Years,” “This Tiny Home is Full of Carpentry Surprises,” “Michael J. Fox’s Wife Shares 30-Year Marriage Secret,” and “Mom Couldn’t Get Baby To Stop Crying – Dog’s Special Technique Has Gotten 8 Million Views!”</p>\n<p>Sections are designated Life, Entertainment, Animals, DIY (do-it-yourself) and Food, with the top three trending stories in each category highlighted. Writers typically discuss viral social media posts that appear elsewhere on the internet, and provide links to original or outside sources for some of the material. Stories often appear in the form of lists and slideshows, which share tips or product recommendations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Writers on Shareably.net do not use original reporting to produce stories, although they provide links to outside sources for information, including well-known news outlets or social media posts on Facebook, YouTube or Instagram. Headlines accurately reflect the videos or posts described in the stories.</p>\n<p>Shareably.net does not include a stated corrections policy, and NewsGuard did not find evidence of regular corrections on the site. Co-founder Kevin Chen, reached twice by phone at a listing for the site in San Ramon, California, declined comment. Two NewsGuard emailed queries to the general email address listed on the site, and another query sent to a second email address for prospective advertising partners, did not receive a response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site’s ownership by Shareably Media is indicated on an About page and a copyright statement at the bottom of each page. A general contact email address for Shareably is provided on the About page, but no individual contact information for writers or editors is shared anywhere on the site. Writers are identified by name — sometimes only by first name — and some share biographical information at the bottom of their stories.</p>\n<p>The About page also provides an email address for pursuing partnerships, but the site does not identify any partners or explain the nature of partnerships. Chen, the co-founder, declined comment when reached twice by phone. Shareably did not reply to two NewsGuard queries about the site’s partnership parameters and lack of information about its content creators or top editors. </p>\n<p>Traditional advertising, however, is clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Shareably began publishing online in 2015. The website’s Facebook page states that Shareably began as “a getaway from the negative and controversial news that dominates traditional media outlets.” </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nPam Weber-Leaf\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Kendrick McDonald&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/shareably/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/shareably/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/shareablynow/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pinterest.com/shareablynow/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.manta.com/c/mhb815s/shareably-media-llcin\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.manta.com/c/mhb815s/shareably-media-llcin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterkim45366/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterkim45366/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinchen1/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinchen1/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/Document/RetrievePDF?Id=201510510416-19356099\" target=\"_blank\">https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/Document/RetrievePDF?Id=201510510416-19356099</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pollyklaas.org/enews-archive/2013-enews/article-web-pages/the-truth-about-runaways.html#.W4QbWOhKg2w\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pollyklaas.org/enews-archive/2013-enews/article-web-pages/the-truth-about-runaways.html#.W4QbWOhKg2w</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"shareably.net","author":"Pam Weber-Leaf","date":"2018-08-29T18:50:26.168+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/shareably.net/"}}
