The site’s content ranges from political stories, such as “Bernie Sanders announces 2020 presidential campaign,” to niche culture or science stories, such as “Scientists finally explain why microwaved grapes emit glorious bursts of plasma.”</p>\n<p>Most content consists of videos or excerpts from other publications, supplemented with the site’s own commentary. Some articles are based solely on tweets and other social media posts.</p>\n<p>The site also occasionally publishes original reporting.</p>\n<p>Boing Boing produces a weekly newsletter that provides a roundup of Boing Boing stories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The typical structure of a Boing Boing post is an introductory sentence or paragraph that describes the news development and the media source, followed by an excerpt or video. At the bottom of the story, Boing Boing typically provides some form of credit for the videos and images contained in the post. </p>\n<p>Boing Boing maintains public forums on a range of topics, including politics, cycling, and games, enabling users to post on the site. These posts are typically not vetted or edited. Boing Boing publishes community guidelines outlining how users are expected to behave in the forums, such as “Don’t post or encourage insulting, bullying, victim-blaming, racist, sexist, violent, or homophobic remarks,” and “Don’t post e-mail addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, URL-shortened links that obscure the target, porn, or gore.” </p>\n<p>While the forums are separate from the rest of the site’s editorial content, if readers share a forum page link on, say, Facebook, the link to the forum page appears in the Facebook post the same way a regular story would, without any indication it is user-generated. Jason Weisberger, Boing Boing’s publisher, said in an email to NewsGuard: “It’s certainly unintended and we’ll act ASAP to ensure that user comments linked to on Facebook don’t generate the potentially confusing branding.”</p>\n<p>Because Boing Boing forum posts are not clearly labeled to indicate if they are user-generated, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not gather and present news responsibly. </p>\n<p>Boing Boing posts are often opinionated, as would be expected of a blog. However, the site does not reveal a particular point of view, yet its political stories are typically left-leaning and critical of the Trump administration and conservatives. Some recent headlines include: “No, Steve Bannon should not speak at your journalism conference. Here’s why,” and “Fox News shocked to discover weird new mobile phones got cameras in ‘em.” One of its forums is titled “The Gallery of Trump-Inspired A**holes.” </p>\n<p>Because Boing Boing does not disclose a point of view and yet cherry picks stories advancing a left-leaning perspective, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>Asked about Boing Boing’s approach to opinion and why it does not disclose a point of view, Weisberger said an email: “Boing Boing is a blog: an informal and opinionated avalanche of posts. Boing Boing is a famous exemplar of this form of writing and has been for nearly 20 years. No reader is confused or misled about the opinionatedness or point of view represented by ‘No, Steve Bannon should not speak at your journalism conference.’” </p>\n<p>He continued: “As a group blog, there is no overall point of view. The editors share general beliefs (none could be credibly described as conservative, for example!) but have sharply different opinions on particular matters. When we produce original news reportage, however, we use formal journalistic English to signal to the reader that it is to be understood as such.”</p>\n<p>Although Boing Boing does not post a corrections policy, the site regularly runs corrections, in the form of a note at the bottom or top of the story explaining what was corrected.</p>\n<p>Boing Boing was the recipient of a 2005 Webby award, given by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, in recognition of “excellence on the internet.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles generally include the name of the writer, with a link to an archive of the writer’s other articles on the site.</p>\n<p>After an earlier version of this Nutrition Label was published, the site added contact information for six of the site’s seven leaders, who are also the site’s main writers. Therefore, NewsGuard has determined that its meets the standard for providing information on content creators.</p>\n<p>The About Us page now provides an email address that readers can use to contact Weisberger, the blog’s publisher. Because of the information added to the site about Weisberger and the site’s top editors, NewsGuard has determined that Boing Boing now adequately reveals who is in charge. </p>\n<p>The site names its co-founders, Carla Sinclair and Mark Frauenfelder, and its publisher, but does not say if they or other editors listed on that page own the company. In the site’s Terms of Service, Boing Boing states that Happy Mutants, LLC “created” boingboing.net. However, there is not a clear disclosure on the site explaining that Happy Mutants LLC owns Boing Boing (nor who runs Happy Mutants). For these reasons, NewsGuard has determined that Boing Boing does not sufficiently disclose its ownership.</p>\n<p>In response to NewsGuard’s question about ownership, Weisberger reiterated that the site is owned by Happy Mutants, LLC.    </p>\n<p>Some articles on the site are advertisements that are written to appear as stories. However, these stories generally appear on the homepage under a banner that says “Boing Boing Store” or “Boing Boing Shop.” Often, “Boing Boing’s Shop” also appears on individual stories. Some posts link to Amazon products for sale. While these are not always labeled, a disclosure at the bottom of every page states, \"We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\" NewsGuard has therefore determined that the site meets the standard for labeling advertising. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Boing Boing was founded in 1988 by husband and wife Mark Frauenfelder and Carla Sinclair as a “cyberpunk” zine -- a term used to describe a genre of countercultural science fiction that portrays a future “dominated by computer technology.”</p>\n<p>In 2010, The Atlantic and Fast Company both reported that Boing Boing was one of the most popular blogs “on the planet.” Around the same time, Time magazine named Boing Boing one of the best 25 blogs in the world. A CNET story on “the 50 most significant moments of Internet history” mentions the launch of the Boing Boing website as an important development in the growth of “Web 1.0,” an early version of the world wide web.</p>\n<p>According to a 2010 article in Fast Company, in 2004 the site’s founders reached out to media entrepreneur John Battelle because of mounting costs. Battelle and the group from Boing Boing formed a new company, Happy Mutants LLC, which sought to turn the site — which essentially was a hobby for the editors — into a business. That company is no longer active<strong>,</strong> according to the California Secretary of State’s Office.</p>\n<p>“[It was] the early days of personality-based blogging, and each of them had a unique personality, point of view, and expertise related to internet culture generally,” Battelle said, referring to the site’s editors. “It was a good place to take the pulse of what was important in early internet culture. I think it got a huge following because of that, and it still has one.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label misspelled the last name of one of the site’s co-founders, Mark Frauenfelder.</em></p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note:  After an earlier version of this Nutrition Label was published, Boing Boing added information to the site about content creators and site leaders and now meets NewsGuard’s standard for those criteria. Also, after additional review, NewsGuard has determined that the site meets the standard for labeling advertising. This update also incorporates comments from the site’s publisher.</em></p>\n<p><em>Disclosure</em><em>: John Battelle, an early advisor to Boing Boing, serves on NewsGuard’s advisory board.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nKate Harloe\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>About Us <a href=\"http://archive.is/jrhUZ\"
