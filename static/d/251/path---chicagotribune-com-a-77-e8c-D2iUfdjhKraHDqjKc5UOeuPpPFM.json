Tribune owns newspapers and publications in major markets, including The Baltimore Sun, New York Daily News, and Orlando Sentinel. </p>\n<p>Tribune generates revenue through advertising and subscriptions for its printed and digital products. Its publications have won numerous awards, including a Pulitzer Prize in 2017.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site covers news, politics, sports, and business in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs. National and international news is largely provided by third-party news providers, including The Associated Press, McClatchy, and the Washington Post.</p>\n<p>A section focusing on Chicago politics is called Clout Street. The site also offers sections on business, sports, entertainment, and technology trends. The opinion section features work from staff columnists, the editorial board, and other contributors.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site’s coverage is generally fact-based and balanced, often citing local officials and other named sources, subject-matter experts, and community leaders. Headlines accurately reflect content.</p>\n<p>Corrections are listed on the site’s Accuracy and Ethics page, which also includes a link to the Tribune’s code of editorial principles and a form for readers to report errors.</p>\n<p>Opinion is published in a dedicated section.</p>\n<p>The Tribune’s statement of principles, last updated in 2016, states that the paper approaches its reporting with a point of view, noting it “believes in the traditional principles of limited government.” The Tribune defines those principles as traditionally conservative values, but also states that the news organization “is not blindly or uncritically partisan.”</p>\n<p>The Tribune has been accused of being biased against labor unions, an assertion backed up by a University of Illinois analysis published in 2008. A 2016 study by Microsoft and Stanford University researchers, however, concluded the Tribune’s news coverage had little to no ideological slant, although its opinion pieces leaned Republican.</p>\n<p><br>The Tribune has won 27 Pulitzer Prizes. It was awarded the 2017 prize for feature photography for portraits of a child shooting victim. It was a finalist in 2018 for local reporting for a series on how the Cook County, Illinois, property tax system favored wealthy homeowners. </p>\n<p>In 2018, the Tribune won two Online Journalism Awards for innovation in investigative journalism and for best feature from a large newsroom, for reporting on sexual abuse and assault in Chicago’s public schools.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Tribune stories generally name the author, along with a biography and email address.  Biographies for Tribune executives are also provided, as well as contact information for various departments, bureaus, and other Tribune-owned publications.</p>\n<p>The site’s About Us page states that the Chicago Tribune is “part of the Tribune Publishing Company portfolio.” Tribune articles about its parent company generally mention its ownership of the paper.</p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored content are distinguished from editorial content. For sponsored posts that resemble articles, the sponsor’s name and logo are listed in place of the byline and a banner marks the content as an ad.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Tribune was first published in 1847, gaining its reputation as a staunch supporter of the Republican Party under longtime co-owner and managing editor Joseph Medill, who bought the paper in 1855. The Tribune went online in 1996. </p>\n<p>Once part of a larger company that included the WGN television and radio stations and the Chicago Cubs, the Tribune and other print publications were spun off into a separate entity in 2014. The company was renamed Tronc in 2016, and opted to change its name back to Tribune Publishing Company in 2018.</p>\n<p>The Tribune’s editorial board has only twice endorsed a Democrat for president: Chicagoan Barack Obama, in 2008 and 2012. </p>\n<p><em>Corrections: An earlier version of this label erroneously reported that the Tribune operated a Washington bureau. The Tribune no longer has a Washington bureau.  An earlier version of this label also erroneously reported that the Tribune’s website was launched in 1998; it launched in 1996.</em></p>\n<p><em>Disclosure: Jim Warren, executive editor of NewsGuard, previously worked at The Chicago Tribune as its managing editor after a variety of reporting and editing roles.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJohn Gregory\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tronc.com/about-us/\"
