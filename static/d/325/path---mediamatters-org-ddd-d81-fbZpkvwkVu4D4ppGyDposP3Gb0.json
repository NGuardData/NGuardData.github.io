As a nonprofit, Media Matters generates money through contributions and grants. Visitors to the site can contribute to Media Matters through the site’s Donate page. </p>\n<p>The chairman and founder of Media Matters is David Brock, a conservative journalist turned liberal activist who also started Democratic Super PAC American Bridge, as well as Correct the Record, a Super PAC that aimed to counter online attacks against Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign. Brock also founded ShareBlue Media, a left-leaning news site that Brock told The Hill he hoped could become “the Breitbart of the left.” </p>\n<p>Media Matters is not legally required to publicly disclose its donors, who gave the organization more than $10 million in 2016, according to the most recently available IRS filings, and does not identify individual donors by year. But some information about where it gets its funding is publicly available. In 2010, hedge fund billionaire and Democratic megadonor George Soros publicly pledged $1 million to Media Matters, and said in an accompanying statement to the New York Times that he hoped the funds would used “in an effort to more widely publicize the challenge Fox News poses to civil and informed discourse in our democracy.” </p>\n<p>A 2012 investigation by conservative news site Daily Caller found several nonprofits that have funded liberal causes contributed to Media Matters: The Ford Foundation, George Soros’ Open Society Foundation, The Schumann Fund for Media and Democracy, and the Sandler Foundation, among others.</p>\n<p>The site does not run advertisements.</p>\n<p>Media Matters acknowledged it had received NewsGuard’s emailed questions asking about the organization’s donors, but did not respond to four follow up emails.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>On its website, Media Matters describes itself as a “progressive research and information center dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.” Its staff monitors print and online media, as well as “at least 150 hours of television and radio each week,” the site says. The group also discloses an activist role by providing “activists, journalists, pundits, and the general public” with the resources to rebut false claims and to take direct action against offending media institutions,” according to the site.  </p>\n<p> The site’s content creators publish short posts containing just the statements made by conservative media, analysis and opinion labeled as blogs, and long-term investigations of media trends. The shorter posts, highlighting content that the site’s editors deem controversial or misleading, contain a headline, brief description above the post, and a video or audio clip and transcript. </p>\n<p>Posts of this kind published in August 2018 included “Tucker Carlson: ‘I actually hate litter which is why I'm so against illegal immigration,’” “NRATV's Dan Bongino: The special counsel investigation ‘has gone from embarrassing to really like an intergalactic disgrace,’” and “Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo glamorizes bulletproof backpacks and clothing for kids in back-to-school segment​.”</p>\n<p>While the site typically covers just conservative media, it also calls out more mainstream and politically neutral news outlets. For example, in August 2018 the site ran a blog titled “Politico published an article saying a man’s death from AIDS was the result of a ‘decadent homosexual lifestyle.’”</p>\n<p>Media Matters maintains a blog featuring opinion and analysis pieces, as well as “rapid response fact-checks of conservative misinformation,” according to the blog’s description. Headlines of running with blog posts in August 2018 included “Fox &#x26; Friends sanitizes anti-government extremists,” “The sinister pro-Trump propaganda of Lou Dobbs,” and “Stop interviewing Steve Bannon.”</p>\n<p>The site contains a Research page, which contains long-term investigations of media trends. For example, in May 2018, Mediamatters.org published a 12-month investigation of abortion and reproductive rights discussions on evening cable news and found “Fox News was responsible for 54% of all segments on those subjects between March 2017 and Mach 2018.” It also found “211 out of 274 statements” about four abortion and reproductive rights topics were inaccurate.</p>\n<p>According to a pitch distributed to donors in 2017 and obtained by the conservative political news site Washington Free Beacon, Mediamatters.org also utilizes “issue teams” that are “focused on correcting misinformation” on five wedge issues: gun violence and public safety, LGBT equality, reproductive health and gender equality, climate and energy, and economic policy.</p>\n<p>Media Matters also engages in activism against conservative media, advocating for advertiser boycotts against companies that run ads on right-leaning shows the group says spread misinformation. It often publishes lists of the shows’ advertisers in order to get the public to pressure them to withdraw advertising from targeted shows. Mediamatters.org has targeted current and former Fox News hosts Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Bill O’Reilly and Glenn Beck with advertiser boycotts.</p>\n<p>The site also has a Take Action link at the top of its home page, which leads to a series of petitions that visitors can sign. As of August 2018, the last petition posted on the page was from May 2018 and called on Facebook to “Stop Enabling Cambridge Analytica, The Trump Campaign, and Other Cheaters.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Media Matters writers meticulously cite and link to sources, often including publication dates next to linked content. They also provide the full context of cited comments in the form of transcripts and videos.</p>\n<p>Mediamatters.org publishes corrections and links to a separate page on its home page. As of  August 2018, the page contained just 10 corrections, the most recent from October 2014, which does not meet NewsGuard’s standard for regularly correcting and clarifying errors. Media Matters did not respond to two emails, a voicemail, and a message sent through the site’s contact form seeking comment about the site’s correction policy.</p>\n<p>Headlines are typically accurate descriptions of comments by conservative political figures and commentators.</p>\n<p>While Media Matters is open about its goal to combat not general misinformation, but specifically conservative misinformation, anonymous staffers told The New Republic in a 2016 article they believed the group strayed from its mission during the 2016 election cycle, and instead played defense for Brock ally Hillary Clinton. In April 2015, The Washington Post’s media critic, Erik Wemple, wrote that Media Matters published a flood of stories defending Clinton after The New York Times broke the news of her personal email server. Media Matters generally notes “large distortions and falsehoods originating in conservative media and threatening to bleed into the mainstream media,” Wemple wrote. “In the case of the Clinton emails, however, Media Matters was spotlighting alleged smaller distortions from the mainstream media, most notably the New York Times.” </p>\n<p>Right-leaning media outlets and pundits often criticize Mediamatters.org, which has positioned itself as their watchdog. In 2017, Bill O’Reilly called the group as “the most dangerous organization in America.” The site has engaged in a long-term campaign to discredit Fox News. In 2010, a planning memo written by Brock said “Fox News is not a news organization. It is the de facto leader of the GOP, and it is long past time that it is treated as such by the media, elected officials and the public.”</p>\n<p>In 2017, the website turned its attention to Breitbart, noting in a “confidential” donor memo that the right-wing news site “plans to export its brand of anti-establishment racism on a global scale.” That same confidential memo said the Brock’s network of organizations, including Media Matters, would work “to resist the normalization of Donald Trump.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Media Matters discloses its mission to serve as a watchdog for conservative media and politicians. However, the site does not disclose its donors.</p>\n<p>The site does not attach author names to its short posts that contain only video and an accompanying transcript, those posts are instead credited to “Media Matters Staff.” The site attaches author names and accompanying short biographies to most of its blog posts and research content, but it does not provide direct email links to those authors (it does provide links to some author Twitter accounts). However, some blog posts are also credited to “Media Matters Staff.” </p>\n<p>Editors are not disclosed on the site. However, Mediamatters.org does provide contact information for the site as a whole, including emails addresses and telephone numbers, as well as a contact form. </p>\n<p>Media Matters did not respond to an email, a voicemail, and a message sent through the site’s contact form seeking comment about the site’s policies around disclosing the members of its staff and disclosing the authors of posts credited to “Media Matters Staff.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Mediamatters.org was founded in 2004 by Brock, who was a conservative investigative reporter in the 1990s who frequently attacked the Clintons before becoming a Democratic activist and outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter around the turn of the century.</p>\n<p>As part of his defection across party lines, Brock admitted in 2001 to lying about Anita Hill in order to defend of Justice Clarence Thomas, who Hill had accused of sexual harassment.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJosh Keefe\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie
