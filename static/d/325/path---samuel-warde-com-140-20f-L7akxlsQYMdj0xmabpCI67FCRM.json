The site, whose official name is “Liberals Unite: The 24-Hour News Magazine for Discerning Liberals,” earns revenue through advertising. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>It offers liberal opinion and commentary about politics and social issues such as gun control, immigration, and drug policies. Political stories generally focus on President Donald Trump. Coverage of foreign policy frequently features stories about the alleged ties between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. It argues that Trump’s international diplomacy has generally failed.</p>\n<p>The site provides a section on Barack Obama, which offers pro-Obama comparisons between his policies and character and those of Trump. Stories include “Obama Is Still Better Than Trump” and “Obama Takes Trump To Task Without Ever Mentioning His Name.”</p>\n<p>Other sections include Women’s Issues, which covers reproductive rights and feminism, and LGBT Issues. Many stories harshly critique Republicans. Examples of headlines that disparage Republicans include “Top 16 Anti-Gay Activists And Lawmakers Caught Being Gay” and “Thanks To Conservatives, Home Abortion May Be Coming To Amazon Soon.” The website calls the Republican agenda a “fraud.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site’s mission statement declares that “we will not publish articles that merely echo the stupid, hateful, bigoted rhetoric that has taken hold of our political discourse.” It also states, “We are not going to create or link to articles merely detailing how Trump and/or the GOP are going to ruin America.” Warde told NewsGuard in an email that “I like to consider our content to be news, but we do occasionally publish opinion and in that case we try to make it clear that we are expressing an opinion.” Warde provided NewsGuard with one example of a story labeled as opinion. </p>\n<p>Headlines and content that are not labeled opinion or commentary feature exaggerated or strongly opinionated language. Examples include, “Newsflash: Trump’s State of the Union Address Sucked,” and “Jim Carrey Uses Twitter To Kick Trump’s Prodigious A**.” In the story about comedian-actor Carrey, the author describes Trump as “ a coward who is too afraid to actually fire a person to their face” and who “gets his toadies to do his dirty work for him and/or uses Twitter to alert the person he is relieving of their position that they are history.”</p>\n<p>When NewsGuard asked Warde how those stories reflected Liberals Unite’s mission statement, he said that “I looked, and those articles do not, in fact, reflect our mission or our published mission statement and have been deleted from the website.”  </p>\n<p>Warde often uses New York Times and Washington excerpts as a springboard to his commentary. He writes most of the content, although the work of other writers, and of a few authors identified only by pseudonyms, also runs on the site. Stories sometimes distort quotes or misrepresent information. A 2017 story titled, “Obama Warns, Trump Must Be Stopped Before It’s Too Late” cited a speech in which Obama said that complacency was responsible for the rise of Nazi Germany. In the speech itself, Obama did not name Trump or issue a warning that “he must be stopped.” When this story was brought to Warde’s attention by NewsGuard, he removed it from the site.</p>\n<p>Another 2017 headline, “Trump Systematically and Willfully Terrorizing Americans,” suggests that the story is news. It was sourced from a series of tweets by Seth Abramson, an assistant professor at the University of New Hampshire, and reflects both distortion and unlabeled opinion. When asked about the headline and story, Warde revised the headline to suggest that it is Abramson’s opinion. The new headline reads, “Seth Abramson: Trump First President To ‘Systematically And Willfully Terrorize His Own Populace.’ ” However, the headline remains distorted, in NewsGuard’s judgment, and still is not labeled as opinion.</p>\n<p>The site provides a corrections policy, which states that it “always seeks to provide corrections and clarifications as soon as they come to our attention.” In addition, the policy details how stories are corrected both on the website and on social media. Regarding retractions, it says that it follows Washington Post guidelines. Those state that the newspaper does not grant “take-down requests,” but will consider taking an article down on a case-by-case basis. NewsGuard found only one example of a story, published in 2012, with a noted correction. NewsGuard asked Warde for more recent examples, and he replied that “I typically delete an article if an error is found.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site names its authors, although Warde’s byline is most frequent. The names of some authors are pseudonyms, including Whatever Jones and Liberty Chastain. Warde told NewsGuard that the pseudonyms are used by “a couple of writers who have concerns about their true identity being revealed. You know: work and/or family concerns.” The website’s “Our Contributors” page provides information about content creators and editors, including short biographies for Warde and some other authors. That page does not address the apparently pseudonymous bylines. It cites Warde as the only editor.</p>\n<p>Advertising on the site is clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>According to its Facebook page, Liberals Unite was founded in
