Eisendrath serves as the company’s CEO. Brands can advertise in the publication through marketing services offered by Sun-Times Media Group. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Chicago.suntimes.com publishes articles related to local, national, and global news on business, politics, entertainment, the tech industry, food, and sports. It also features an obituaries section and an opinion section.</p>\n<p>Chicago.suntimes.com hosts the site “31 Bullets,” an anti-gun violence initiative launched by the publication in April 2018 in response the Chicago’s crime problem. The page details 31 specific actions that readers can take to educate themselves on the issue of gun-control. For example, the first “bullet” features a discussion of guns in classrooms. The page opposes President Trump’s proposal to arm school teachers.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Chicago.suntimes.com articles are fact-based and typically cite multiple sources. The website distinguishes between news and opinion content from its editorial board and columnists. The site does not have a stated corrections policy, but corrections are appended as Editor’s Notes at the end of articles. </p>\n<p>The newspaper’s editorial board has historically expressed a left-leaning perspective. In February 2007, the newspaper’s then editorial page manager announced that the board would focus on upholding the publication’s “liberal, working-class roots.”</p>\n<p>In July 2017, a consortium of private investors and the Chicago Federation of Labor acquired Sun-Times Media Group, including the Chicago Sun-Times. The consortium was led by Edwin Eisendrath, a former Chicago alderman and an active Democratic. After the purchase, representatives of the Chicago Federation of Labor promised that despite the group’s party affiliation, the publication would remain independent when reporting on issues related to labor. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The website’s Contact Us page provides contact information for the newspaper’s editor-in-chief, editorial page manager, deputy managing editor for news and sports, and SVP for digital news products.
