The Dolan family, including Patrick, are the controlling owners of the Madison Square Garden Company, as well as the company’s sports teams, which include the NBA’s New York Knicks and the NHL’s New York Rangers -- teams that Newsday covers.</p>\n<p>Patrick Dolan became majority owner of Newsday LLC in 2016. In 2018, he bought the remaining stake in the company from Altice, a media company based in the Netherlands. </p>\n<p>In 2016, the Dolans sold Cablevision, which provides internet, cable and telephone service in New York City and its suburbs, and the News12 local television network on Long Island, to Altice for more than $17 billion.</p>\n<p>The website is supported by advertising, subscription fees, and branded content created by Brand360, Newsday Media Group’s in-house content studio. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Newsday.com covers Long Island, which includes Nassau and Suffolk counties, as well as New York City. The top of the site’s homepage features links to topic pages that include Long Island, Sports, Entertainment, News, Things to Do, Opinion, Business and Obituaries. The site has separate sections for national and international news, separated into topics such as extreme weather or the Supreme Court. National news is frequently supplied by The Associated Press.</p>\n<p>The site also publishes special sections, such as the monthly “Health Link” and its annual “Top Doctors” report, and a section that hosts interactive maps and data sets, ranging from the concentration of Democratic voters in counties throughout New York State to a map of parking options near a Long Island Railroad station. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Newsday reporters conduct original reporting, verify facts, and interview sources and subjects of stories for comment. The site regularly runs corrections and clarifications, sometimes with “Correction:” in the headline.</p>\n<p>The Contact Newsday page has an email and a telephone number for readers to contact editorial staff with suggestions for corrections. The site clearly labels and differentiates opinion pieces from news content. </p>\n<p>Newsday journalists have won 19 Pulitzer Prizes since 1954. The most recent winners have been Walt Handelsman for editorial cartooning in 2007, Dele Olojede for international reporting in 2005 and Justin Davidson for criticism in 2002.</p>\n<p>More recently, Newsday was a Pulitzer finalist for editorial writing in 2013, and for public service in 2008 for covering hazards on New York railroads, and again in 2014 for exposing misconduct by Long Island police. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Newsday.com attaches author names to stories, and that includes email addresses and biographical information for reporters in the articles they write. The website features a directory with the editorial leaders of the newspaper and their contact information. </p>\n<p>The home page links to a Contact Newsday page that provides a variety of email addresses and phone numbers readers can use to contact various departments, as well as some editors and company leaders. It also lists Dolan as the company’s owner, along with an email address.</p>\n<p>The site provides biographical information, email addresses and Twitter links for the members of its editorial board.</p>\n<p>Newsday Editor-in-Chief Jamshid Mousavinezhad told NewsGuard that Newsday.com did not publish biographical information about the organization’s editorial leaders, but said that editors have decided to add this information to the website.</p>\n<p>The site does not disclose in its own coverage of the Knicks and the Rangers that James Dolan owns the teams, and that  Patrick Dolan is partial owner of the Madison Square Garden company, which owns the teams. The omission has led NewsGuard to determine Newsday.com does not meet standards for adequate disclosure of ownership.</p>\n<p>A Newsday spokesman, Paul Fleishman, told NewsGuard, “James Dolan has no ownership or management position with Newsday, so this is not an issue.” Editors have not responded to inquiries about disclosures that address Patrick Dolan’s ownership of the Madison Square Garden company.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Newsday LLC was founded in 1940. The Newsday.com domain name was created in 1991. Newsday operated a New York City edition, New York Newsday, in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>\n<p>Newsday LLC was purchased by Cablevision Systems Corp. in 2008. Altice USA purchased Cablevision Systems in June 2016, and the Dolans purchased their 75 percent share of Newsday in July 2016. Patrick Dolan became the sole owner in 2018.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nPeter Janecky\n\nEdited by:\nJosh Keefe&#x26;emsp;Amy
