Kaufman, the publisher, is a former board member of the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights Watch, and is active in the Los Angeles advisory group for the International Women’s Media Foundation. Scheer, the site’s editor in chief, is a journalist who worked as a national correspondent for the Los Angeles Times from 1976 to 1993.</p>\n<p>The site earns revenue from advertising and donations. According to its mission statement, Truthdig receives “grants from foundations and philanthropists and contributions from readers who want to ensure that excellent reporting and commentary thrive on the web.”  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Truthdig.com discloses its mission, and a liberal ideology, on its About page, saying it is “dedicated to reporting on current issues that are insufficiently covered by mainstream media” and aims to “dig beneath the headlines, provide expert reporting and commentary from a progressive point of view and offer an outlet for original work by exceptional journalists.”</p>\n<p>In addition to its own stories, Truthdig publishes articles from a number of other sources, including The Associated Press, ProPublica, Climate News Network, and the Independent Media Institute. </p>\n<p>The site divides its content into more than a dozen categories, including activism, politics, surveillance,  immigration, LGBTQ, and race. Typical stories include “Crucifying Julian Assange,” in which journalist Christopher Hedges reports that the Australian-born WikiLeaks founder has been the victim of political persecution; “The Insidious Myth of the Magical American Soldier,” which argues that U.S. soldiers are not the correct answer to war in the Middle East; and “The Cult of Trump,” an examination of the state of the Republican Party in 2018.</p>\n<p>Truthdig lists satirist Andy Borowitz as a contributing columnist, and the website regularly publishes a political column from Robert Reich, former secretary of labor in Bill Clinton’s administration. Truthdig also publishes book, film, and art reviews, and offers a Multimedia section that includes photo essays, videos, and cartoons. </p>\n<p>TD Originals, shorthand for Truthdig Originals, include media projects such as Global Voices: Truthdig Women Reporting, which features stories by female foreign correspondents from around the world. Examples include stories about tensions in U.S.-Pakistan relations, and child brides in Lesotho, a small country encircled by South Africa.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Truthdig.com has an experienced staff of writers and editors, some of whom previously worked for established media organizations such as The New York Times, Newsweek, and National Public Radio. Articles are presented responsibly and quote multiple credible sources, as well as data. The website has won numerous awards, including three first-place Southern California Journalism Awards in 2018: in the Gender/LGBTQ category for a story about Native American rape survivors; in Political Commentary–National for “An Insubordinate President”; and in Commentary on TV/Film for “What Happened to the Female Directors of Hollywood?”</p>\n<p>Truthdig has a separate section for opinion, but some unlabeled opinion articles also appear in its news section, which is why NewsGuard has determined the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. For example, in “America Is Staring Autocracy in the Face,” author Tom Engelhardt wrote in the news section on Nov. 6, 2018, that regardless of the outcome of the U.S. midterm elections, the United States could expect a more autocratic president to emerge. Engelhardt also referred to Trump as a “belligerent, orange-haired salesman-cum-con-artist.”</p>\n<p>Another story, “Fox News Is Really This Divorced From Reality,” published a week after the 2018 midterm elections, stated, “Once again proving they probably don’t realize just how popular such ideas have become, Fox News on Tuesday tried to ridicule and discredit key platform planks that progressive Democrats successfully ran on this election cycle but ended up just reminding people that these ideas actually make a lot of sense.”</p>\n<p>Asked why some stories appear in both news and opinion sections, the site’s executive editor Kasia Anderson told NewsGuard that Truthdig redesigned its site a year ago, and it may have happened “mechanically.”</p>\n<p>“We take distinctions between news and opinion very seriously, and though Truthdig has always been an online publication, we have insisted on keeping some traditions from legacy media going -- that is one of them,” Anderson said.</p>\n<p>Truthdig does not have a corrections policy posted on its site, but NewsGuard found that the site regularly makes corrections, explaining the mistakes in italics at the bottom of stories. Headlines accurately represent story content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Truthdig names its authors and provides their biographical information. The About page names staff, including the publisher and editor in chief, and provides an extensive list of correspondents and contributors.</p>\n<p>The website’s mission statement says, “Ads and the income they produce do not play a big role in Truthdig’s operation. The site is not influenced by advertisers or shareholders and is not controlled by any outside entity.”</p>\n<p>Although Truthdig.com said that it receives grants and corporate donations, it does not disclose the donors’ names, which is why NewsGuard has determined that the site does not clearly disclose ownership and relevant financing.</p>\n<p>“Some donors have requested that we maintain their privacy, which is something that we have done as a courtesy, but we're not interested in compromising journalistic ethics,” Anderson told NewsGuard.</p>\n<p>Advertisements on the site are clearly distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>According to her biography, Kaufman met Scheer while working for the Los Angeles Times Westside Weekly and Our Times editions. The two founded Truthdig.com in November 2005. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Peggy
