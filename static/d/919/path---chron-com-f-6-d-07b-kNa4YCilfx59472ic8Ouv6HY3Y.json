Its other prominent newspaper brands include the San Francisco Chronicle, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, and Albany Times-Union. Hearst generates revenue from advertising and subscriptions to its printed and digital products.</p>\n<p>The paper also operates HoustonChronicle.com, which unlike Chron.com, limits the number of articles a reader can access for free.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Chron.com says it seeks to deliver “in-depth coverage of local issues, [and is] committed to covering state, national and international news.” The site offers predominantly breaking local news for free and much of the paper’s premium content, such as investigations, is found on HoustonChronicle.com</p>\n<p>Chron.com features original reporting on local and state politics, sports, business, technology, lifestyle, and other topics. The Associated Press supplies some national and international stories, and the daily San Antonio Express-News provides more Texas coverage.</p>\n<p>The newspaper has bureaus in Austin, the state capital, as well as Washington, Mexico, and Colombia. The site dedicates a section to Mexico and Latin America news, with an emphasis on immigration. Texas high school sports is a major focus.  An August 2018 story, for example, detailed the spiraling cost of new local football stadiums.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Chron.com offers balanced and professionally reported coverage, and headlines accurately reflect the content of articles. The site regularly runs corrections, and includes a page where corrections and clarifications are listed. Opinion is separated from news coverage.</p>\n<p>In 2015, Houston Chronicle columnist Lisa Falkenberg won a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for what the Pulitzer board called her “vividly-written, groundbreaking columns about grand jury abuses that led to a wrongful conviction and uncovered other egregious problems in the legal and immigration systems.” In 2018, the newspaper’s coverage of Hurricane Harvey won the Associated Press Media Editors’ grand prize for news reporting.</p>\n<p>In November 2018, the Houston Chronicle announced that it would retract eight stories and correct 64 others written by Mike Ward, the paper’s former Austin bureau chief. The moves came in the wake of an investigation conducted by an independent journalist hired by the Houston Chronicle to review Ward’s work during his four years at the paper.</p>\n<p>“The relationship between a newspaper and its readers is one of trust,” Houston Chronicle Executive Editor Nancy Barnes said in an article summarizing the investigation’s results. “This investigation points to an egregious breach of that trust that is an offense to readers and journalists alike. We apologize to our readers, and to the Houston community.”</p>\n<p>Ward resigned in September 2018 after another Houston Chronicle journalist raised questions about the accuracy of one of his stories and researchers could not authenticate multiple sources referenced in the article. At the time, Barnes wrote that Ward “insisted that his work was truthful” and “involved real people.”<br></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Stories include the name of the writer and links to biographical and contact information. The names and titles of executives are available on the Our Company page. Editorial managers can only be found via their names on stories and can be emailed through a form that does not disclose their email address. </p>\n<p>On the About Houston Chronicle Media Group page, the site discloses it is owned by Hearst Corp.</p>\n<p>Advertising is clearly marked.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Houston Chronicle was founded in 1901. Its website launched in 1997.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nDavid Wolinsky\n\nEdited by:\nJim Warren&#x26;emsp;Eric
