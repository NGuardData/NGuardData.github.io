Opinion columnists, who most often write about local politics, schools, and immigration, are prominently featured. </p>\n<p>The AZ Fact Check section looks at the veracity of statements related to local news, such as the Pulitzer Prize-winning series on the proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall. Reports in that section are prominently featured with videos.</p>\n<p>Users can find tabs for national and international news on azcentral.com, content produced by USA Today, and Network news sites.</p>\n<p>The Arizona Republic’s most frequently endorses conservative candidates and causes.

A link to Republic Media refers to the executive team for the local publications.</p>\n<p>The site identifies itself as part of the USA Today Network.  Most stories are attributed to their authors, and the bylines indicate if the reporter is local, from the USA Today staff or has another affiliation. Ads are clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Arizona Republican began publishing in 1890, shortening its name to the Arizona Republic in 1930.
