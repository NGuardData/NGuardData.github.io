The biography of one of the site’s authors, Christy Lee Parker, says that her husband, Cory Barrow, founded the website. Based on public records searches and extensive research, NewsGuard believes that both of these names are pseudonyms.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard was unable to speak with anyone associated with the site on the record and did not receive responses to two emails sent to an address on the website.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>According to the “About Us” page of the website, “Mad World News is firmly devoted to bringing you the truth and the stories that the mainstream media ignores. Together we can restore our constitutional republic to what the founding fathers envisioned and fight back against the liberal media.”</p>\n<p>Writers on the site publish stories directing outrage at and often disparaging liberals (in government and popular culture), Muslims, undocumented immigrants and criminal offenders.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Mad World News fails to meet many of NewsGuard’s criteria for assessing the reliability of news and information websites. On multiple occasions, writers at Mad World News have published stories with false information that have gone uncorrected. Fact-Checkers at the nonpartisan organization Snopes have highlighted a number of instances in which the site has reported unsubstantiated allegations that were later proven false. Notably, the site was among many right-wing outlets that pushed a false story alleging that Syrian refugees had raped a girl in Twin Falls, Idaho at knife-point. Even after the story had been disproven by multiple news outlets and the Twin Falls County Prosecutor rejected this narrative, Mad World News continued referencing the incident as much as a year later.</p>\n<p>The site has also published stories promoting conspiracy theories rooted in rampant speculation. Writers have frequently referenced the thoroughly disproven “Clinton Body Count” conspiracy theory, which draws connections between individuals who suffer untimely or suspicious deaths and the Clinton family to suggest foul play by the latter. Most recently, in July 2018, the site raised questions about the connection between a deceased New York woman and Hillary Clinton through longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The Pulitzer-Prize winning fact-checking organization Politifact found no reason to draw such a connection and reported that the story’s headline was misleading to suggest such a false information.</p>\n<p>Many headlines on the site are similarly deceptive. A May 2018 article led by informing readers “ABC Execs Tell Roseanne to Stop Supporting Trump, Didn’t Expect Her Response.” The writer does not include any evidence that the TV actress was instructed to stop supporting the president. Instead, it offers a quote, reported on thewrap.com, from an ABC executive saying that the show would shift “away from politics and toward family.”</p>\n<p>Sensationalized stories about health and science also stand out. Writers regularly raise doubts about the existence of climate change and spread sensationalized and overly fearful theories about diseases.</p>\n<p>Throughout much of the website, stories draw from unreliable sources and egregiously distort facts to advance far-right positions. However, the only indication that the site comes from a partisan perspective appears on a Career Opportunities page that is unlikely to be read by many readers. There, the website states that it looks to hire “news commentators who can offer a unique opinion on the news for a Christian conservative audience.” Even when stories do not contain falsehoods, they are typically labeled as news despite their highly opinionated content and tone.</p>\n<p>Mad World News does not issue corrections to stories with errors.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Mad World News does not disclose information about its owners, operators, or content creators in a user-friendly manner. Biographical information is provided for some writers, but there are several contributors who publish under pseudonyms, including two who go by “That Conservative Girl” and “Dom the Conservative.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The website’s domain was registered in 2013.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nKendrick McDonald\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/mad-world-news/&nbsp;(false\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.snopes.com/tag/mad-world-news/ (false</a> story about Idaho attack)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/northwest/idaho/article84829787.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/northwest/idaho/article84829787.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://madworldnews.com/abc-execs-roseanne-trump/&nbsp;(Roseanne\" target=\"_blank\">https://madworldnews.com/abc-execs-roseanne-trump/ (Roseanne</a> story)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://madworldnews.com/trump-abc-fired-roseanne/&nbsp;(other\" target=\"_blank\">https://madworldnews.com/trump-abc-fired-roseanne/ (other</a> Roseanne story)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://madworldnews.com/idaho-girl-molested-muslims/\" target=\"_blank\">https://madworldnews.com/idaho-girl-molested-muslims/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://archive.is/Jfj3i\" target=\"_blank\">http://archive.is/Jfj3i</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://madworldnews.com/hillary-dead-body-huma-abedin/\" target=\"_blank\">https://madworldnews.com/hillary-dead-body-huma-abedin/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://madworldnews.com/new-report-earth-cooling-event/\" target=\"_blank\">https://madworldnews.com/new-report-earth-cooling-event/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://madworldnews.com/career-opportunities/\" target=\"_blank\">https://madworldnews.com/career-opportunities/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://madworldnews.com/bill-gates-big-brother-watch/\" target=\"_blank\">https://madworldnews.com/bill-gates-big-brother-watch/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://madworldnews.com/hillary-dead-body-huma-abedin/\" target=\"_blank\">https://madworldnews.com/hillary-dead-body-huma-abedin/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"madworldnews.com","author":"Kendrick McDonald","date":"2018-07-27T15:09:26.850+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/madworldnews.com/"}}
