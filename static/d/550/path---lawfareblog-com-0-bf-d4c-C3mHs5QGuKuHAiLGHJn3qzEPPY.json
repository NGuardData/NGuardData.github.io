The Lawfare Institute publishes the site in cooperation with the Brookings Institute, a Washington think tank. Lawfare is supported by donations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site publishes articles and essays on a wide variety of national security topics, ranging from cybersecurity and drones to ISIS and FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The site also publishes government documents, reviews of books and legal briefs, several podcasts, and topical sections, such as Aegis, which explores the intersection of technology and national security, and Omphalos, which focuses on the Middle East. The site also features a job board for national security vacancies in the U.S. government, think tanks, and other institutions, as well as an events calendar and a page allowing visitors to subscribe to Lawfare newsletters.</p>\n<p>The first post by Wittes declared: “We mean to devote this blog to that nebulous zone in which actions taken or contemplated to protect the nation interact with the nation’s laws and legal institutions…The name Lawfare refers both to the use of law as a weapon of conflict and, perhaps more importantly, to the depressing reality that America remains at war with itself over the law governing its warfare with others.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Lawfare offers a balanced, often scholarly array of news reports, analysis, and opinion on the topics Wittes envisioned. It has become widely read by those of all political stripes involved in national security law and policy. Content is written by Lawfare’s contributors and editors, all of whom have a legal or policy background and range in experience from law school students to university professors to senior members at think tanks and institutions. Articles rely on reporting from credible news sources, such as the Los Angeles Times and Reuters, as well as U.S. government documents and websites, such as Justice.gov.</p>\n<p>Lawfare founder Ben Wittes, who serves as editor in chief, was a reporter for Washington-based Legal Times before becoming an editorial writer at the Washington Post. He is a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution. He achieved added attention in mid-2017 after FBI Director James Comey, a friend, was fired by President Trump. For several weeks, Wittes emerged as Comey’s chief public defender, writing what Comey had told him about what he asserted were his interactions with President Trump. He appears frequently on television news shows discussing a variety of national security issues, as well as the investigations into Russian election meddling.</p>\n<p>Co-founder and frequent contributor Jack Goldsmith, who is a professor at Harvard Law School, served in the George W. Bush administration’s Justice Department as assistant attorney general in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel. A conservative who had been a senior legal adviser at the Bush Administration’s Pentagon, Goldsmith worked to overturn the office’s controversial memos defending the legality of torture. He resigned in 2004 and wrote a memoir of his experiences at the Justice Department grappling with national security issues such as warrantless wiretaps and torture.</p>\n<p>Lawfare’s third co-founder and frequent contributor is Robert Chesney, a law professor at the University of Texas specializing in national security issues.</p>\n<p>The site regularly publishes updates and corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles and essays provide the name of the writer, generally linking to biographical and contact information. The masthead page features an extensive list of Lawfare’s editors and contributors, also linking to biographical and contact information.</p>\n<p>The site discloses its affiliation to the Lawfare Institute and its status as a 501(c)(3) organization.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site was founded in 2010.</p>\n<p><em>Disclosure: NewsGuard co-CEO Steven Brill’s daughter, who practices law in Washington, has occasionally written for LawFare.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSteven Brill\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/support-lawfare\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lawfareblog.com/support-lawfare</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.brookings.edu/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/subscribe-lawfare\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lawfareblog.com/subscribe-lawfare</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/upcoming-events\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lawfareblog.com/upcoming-events</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-job-board\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-job-board</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/coverage/aegis\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lawfareblog.com/coverage/aegis</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/omphalos\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lawfareblog.com/omphalos</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/topic/lawfare-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lawfareblog.com/topic/lawfare-podcast</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/welcome-lawfare\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lawfareblog.com/welcome-lawfare</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/blowing-sources-update-and-correction\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lawfareblog.com/blowing-sources-update-and-correction</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/masthead\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lawfareblog.com/masthead</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/welcome-lawfare\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lawfareblog.com/welcome-lawfare</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"lawfareblog.com","author":"Steven Brill","date":"2018-08-11T02:45:15.524+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/lawfareblog.com/"}}
