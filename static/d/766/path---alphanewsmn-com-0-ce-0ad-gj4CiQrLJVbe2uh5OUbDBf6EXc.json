According to Minnesota business records, Alpha News is a nonprofit corporation originally registered in February 2015 by Alex Kharam, the executive director of the Minnesota Freedom Club, a right-leaning political group founded by Republican donor Robert Cummins. The address given on the filings is a UPS Store in Minnetonka, Minnesota. Kharam has not spoken about his involvement with Alpha News, despite repeated requests for comment from various Minnesota publications.</p>\n<p>In a 2015 article on the Minneapolis Star Tribune’s website, blogger Michael Brodkorb wrote that in an interview with former Alpha News Chief Capitol Reporter Julia Erynn, she said the site was a “news organization” financed by advertising and “a number of private donors.” She also told Brodkorb that many of the people behind the site “would like to remain anonymous.” </p>\n<p>The site does not run advertising, but it does contain a page for readers to donate.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Alpha News provides coverage and analysis of politics and media both in Minnesota and nationally. The About page states that “Alpha News reports on issues relating to local, state and federal government, as well as the people and personalities involved.” Articles are sourced from original interviews and press releases, as well as other online news sources. </p>\n<p>The site contains a section with original videos. Some include firsthand interviews, such as a May 2018 video about proposed abortion legislation in Minnesota that interviewed a representative of an anti-abortion advocacy group. Other videos contain edited footage from other sources.</p>\n<p>News and opinion pieces reflect a conservative political perspective. A typical news headline included this reference to congressional candidate Dan Feehan and congressman Keith Ellison: “Democrat Dan Feehan is No Moderate, He’ll Stand with Extremists Like Keith Ellison.” Ellison, who was a congressman elected as state attorney general in 2018, and Ilhan Omar, who was elected to Congress in 2018, were referred to as “clear and present dangers” in another news section headline. Alpha News columnist John Gilmore wrote in an Alpha News piece that the site does not “fall along the typical left/right divide” after Minnesota Public Radio referred to it as conservative.</p>\n<p>The site hosts a “Biased Media of the Week Contest” which asks readers to submit examples of a “biased headline, tweet, or story” from local media outlets for the chance to win a $50 Visa gift card. While the site does not appear to announce a winner each week, past winners have generally found “bias” in media that favors liberal or Democratic public figures. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Alpha News has repeatedly published stories that advance a baseless claim that Democrat Ilhan Omar, the first Somali American elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, married her brother for immigration purposes—an allegation that first appeared in a since-deleted post on the forum somalispot.com. Alpha News published various articles in August 2016 that advanced this claim by quoting a “Somali community member speaking under the terms of anonymity” and referencing “multiple sources and social media.” The site posted side-by-side photos of Omar’s father and a man Alpha News claimed was her husband, stating that “a clear familial resemblance can be seen.” Some of these articles appeared with headlines asserting the theory as fact, such as the August 2016 headline “The Brother Ilhan Omar Legally Married Sends Alpha News an Email.”</p>\n<p>Since the site initially posted articles advancing the theory in 2016, it has continually reasserted the claim. Stories in 2018 included “Ilhan Omar: MN Media Blackout On New Report Supporting Claims She Married Her Brother,” “New Evidence Supports Claims That Ilhan Omar Married Her Brother,” and “Ilhan Omar Refuses To Answer Questions On Controversial Marriage History, Campaign Finance Violations.” </p>\n<p>Omar has called the claim “absolutely false and ridiculous.” In an August 2016 letter to Omar’s lawyer, U.S. Attorney Anthony Luger wrote that his office was not investigating Omar’s immigration status, nor had an investigation been requested. The letter was sent in response to an allegation by Fox 9 News in Minneapolis that Luger had launched an immigration fraud investigation against Omar. In an October 2018 article, The Associated Press reported that the claims “are based on unverified photos that appear on conservative news sites.”</p>\n<p>The site does not disclose that it favors any political leaning, despite its frequent tendency to publish right-leaning views and opinion. The site’s video reporting also often favors a conservative perspective, such as a May 2018 video headlined “Rebecca Otto Wants To Give Illegal Immigrants Voting Rights” that painted Otto, then a Democratic candidate for Minnesota governor, as “unpredictable” and “emotional.”</p>\n<p>Although the site contains separate sections for “Latest News” and “Commentary,” news and commentary appear in both. Additionally, many articles are tagged as both “Opinion &#x26; Commentary” and “Latest News.”</p>\n<p>Because of the lack of disclosure about its conservative-leaning viewpoint, and its publishing of unverified information to advance claims that Omar married her brother, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not meet its criteria for gathering and presenting information responsibly, avoiding deceptive headlines, or responsibly distinguishing between opinion and news. </p>\n<p>Alpha News does not post a corrections policy, and NewsGuard was unable to find examples of corrections recently published to its articles.</p>\n<p>Alpha News did not respond to two emails from NewsGuard asking about the site’s approach to corrections, failing to distinguish between opinion and news, using deceptive headlines, and not gathering and presenting information responsibly. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The About page names its editor in chief, two columnists, and an intern, including their biographical and contact information. Articles include author names, and articles that are written by freelance contributors and guest columnists include biographical information for authors. The site does not post advertisements. </p>\n<p>The site does not disclose its ownership or sources of funding, and Alpha News did not respond to two emails from NewsGuard seeking comment on its ownership disclosure.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The domain name alphanewsmn.com was registered on February 23, 2015. A blog article published on March 10, 2015 on the Star Tribune’s website said that Alpha News had launched on the same day.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nLillian Childress\n\nEdited by:\nSarah
