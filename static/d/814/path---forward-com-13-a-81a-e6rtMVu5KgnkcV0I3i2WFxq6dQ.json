In addition to fundraising efforts, the association’s 2017 annual report lists advertising, print subscriptions and newsstand sales, and investment funds among the organization’s top revenue sources. It reported $1.9 million in donations in 2017.</p>\n<p>The Forward’s online advertisements include display ads and sponsored content. It also charges subscription fees for unrestricted access to the site’s content.</p>\n<p>In January 2019, the Forward, which had moved from a weekly to a monthly print publication in 2017, announced that it would cease its print production in the spring. It also laid off nearly 30 percent of its staff, including its editor and chief and executive editor.</p>\n<p>“While it’s essential that we take these steps to ensure our financial survival, it’s also the right way to better serve the vast majority of our readership,” which is online, publisher Rachel Fishman Feddersen wrote in a note to readers. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Forward covers politics, education, Jewish-American celebrities, anti-Semitism, issues related to Israel and Palestine, and other stories of interest to the American Jewish community. The tagline for one news section of the website, called Fast Forward, is “Quick reads through a Jewish lens.” Its About Us page says the Forward serves as “the voice of the American Jew and the conscience of the community.”</p>\n<p>Although the site is aimed at an American audience, it also publishes news on politics in Israel, the Middle East, and Europe that affect Judaism and Jewish life.</p>\n<p>The site’s Culture section covers art, books, film and TV, music, and theatre, as well as a page for longform articles. A Life section includes stories on travel, technology, style, health, faith, and family, and a blog called The Schmooze.</p>\n<p>The site also links to a Yiddish-language version of the Forward.</p>\n<p>Forward.com also publishes news reports from outside outlets such as the Jewish Telegraphic Agency and Reuters news services, as well as the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Forward.com’s news reports are based on a mix of original  interviews, primary source documents, and reporting by other outlets, such as Axios and The New York Times.</p>\n<p>Its original reports are evenhanded and address multiple angles and points of view, although its coverage is focused on its stated mission to serve the American Jewish community. For example, in November 2018, coverage of the October 2018 synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh included a story on President Donald Trump speaking about how the shooting affected Republicans’ chances in the midterm elections, as well as a story of an Israeli organization that traveled to Pittsburgh to comfort residents.</p>\n<p>Correction notices generally appear underneath articles in which errors have been fixed. Headlines are straightforward and accurately reflect content.</p>\n<p>The Forward’s coverage of Israel has been balanced. It has published stories from the Jewish Telegraphic Agency and Ha’aretz that have accurately covered more negative developments in the Netanyahu administration.</p>\n<p>In August 2015, the Forward published “A Jewish Journalist’s Exclusive Look Inside Iran.”  An editorial published the same day called it “the very first credentialed reporting from a member of the Jewish media since the Islamic Republic was founded in 1979.” The writer, Larry Cohler-Esses, acknowledged that the visa approval, which occurred shortly before Congress was to vote on the Iran nuclear deal, “could have been a well-timed move to influence that debate.” Cohler-Esses did not reach any conclusions in his article, although he did find that Iranians were more open-minded about Israel.</p>\n<p>In October 2017, the Forward removed an article based on an essay posted in Medium.com by a woman who claimed that Nobel laureate -- and former Forward staff member -- Elie Wiesel sexually harassed her in 1989. An editor’s note that appeared on the site the same day said “the story did not meet our journalistic standards and has been removed.” Two days later, Forward editor-in-chief Jane Eisner wrote that the Forward’s article “cited an allegation published on another website, from a single source, with no corroborating evidence and no response from the alleged attacker or his representative.”</p>\n<p>Forward.com has an Opinion section that includes editorials and columns. However, unlabeled opinionated content appears elsewhere on the site, which is why NewsGuard has determined the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. For example, an October 2018 article appearing in the Culture section argued that morality is declining in the U.S., saying, “Whatever else Donald Trump and his minions do, and I am fairly certain they haven’t even done their worst yet, their destruction of conventional morality in record time may be their lasting and irreparable legacy.” In “Not Vaccinating Your Kids Is Very Un-Jewish,” which appears in the site’s Faith section, the author recommends, “This is a message that should be spread across Orthodox communities by those with the power to influence: Public health is of the utmost importance.” And in a breaking news section called “Fast Forward,” a story headlined “Sheldon Adelson Had A Really, Really Terrible Night” offers, “It must’ve been a bit embarrassing watching his own state to fail to come through for the GOP,” after the Republican billionaire’s home state of Nevada elected a Democratic senator and governor.</p>\n<p>Forward vice president of marketing Kathleen Chambard told NewsGuard that the site is open to improving its labeling of opinion content. “As a rule on our website, users kind of know the news section is where they can find news … but still, point taken,” Chambard said.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>A Masthead page identifies the Forward’s staff members, including top editors and its publisher. The masthead links to managers’ author pages, which share their email addresses. Stories identify authors, and their contact information is typically found underneath articles.</p>\n<p>The About Us page indicates the Forward is a nonprofit organization and links to a page for the Forward’s latest annual reports. The 2017 annual report lists the people and organizations who donated as little as $500 to the Forward in 2017, although some are anonymous. The About Us page says the Forward’s “news judgment is made independently and not on the basis of donor support.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Forward was founded in 1897 as a daily newspaper, which was published in Yiddish. Its English version launched in 1983 as a supplement. Forward.com was created in 1996.</p>\n<p>The Forward’s former staff include Wiesel, the winner of the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize and author of the Night trilogy of books, and Isaac Bashevis Singer, who won the 1978 Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>\n<p>In 2017, the Forward stopped publishing a weekly print newspaper and shifted to a monthly print magazine.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSam
