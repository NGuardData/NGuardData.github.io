It owns more than 40 daily newspapers around the country, as well as various weekly publications and magazines, including Mother Earth News. The company’s name is unrelated to the city of Ogden, Utah, and instead refers to the company’s founder, H.C. Ogden.  </p>\n<p>The Standard-Examiner is financed by advertisements and subscriptions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Standard-Examiner provides coverage of crime, weather, government, business, and culture in the Ogden, Utah, area. Most local content is produced by Standard-Examiner reporters, and national and global news coverage is provided by The Associated Press.</p>\n<p>A separate Opinion section houses columns, editorials, and letters to the editor. A Jail Mugs section is featured at the top of the site and on the website’s homepage, publishing mug shots from the Weber County Jail in Ogden, Utah.</p>\n<p>The site also provides access to a digital version of the paper’s print version.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Standard-Examiner employs a staff of journalists that conduct original, well-reported articles often referencing multiple sources. When referencing information reported by other news outlets, articles typically link to the original report. Headlines are straightforward and reflect the facts reported in the article. Opinion is housed in a separate section.</p>\n<p>The publication regularly corrects articles, typically by adding an “Editor’s Note” to the top of the piece explaining the mistake. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>A Personnel section of the site includes a staff directory with contact information for editors and reporters. Most articles contain bylines naming their author, typically providing contact information and a brief biography at the bottom of articles.</p>\n<p>Although the Standard-Examiner reported on its acquisition by Ogden Newspapers in 2018, the site does not disclose its ownership in a user-friendly manner. Asked about this by NewsGuard, Standard-Examiner Executive Editor Jordan Carroll said in an email: “Since the purchase this summer, a new website was constructed and launched for the Standard-Examiner. There are still many improvements that need and will be made to the website that are being worked on.”</p>\n<p>Advertisements are clearly distinguishable from editorial content. The site publishes sponsored stories from BrandPoint content, published in a section of the homepage titled Sponsored Content, and articles themselves contain an “advertorial” label at the top.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The newspaper was founded in 1888. In 2018, Ogden Newspapers purchased the Standard-Examiner from its previous owner, Sandusky Newspapers, which had owned the publication since 1993. After acquiring the newspaper, Ogden Newspapers cut 21 positions in May 2018. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJack Craver\n\nEdited by:\nSarah Brandt&#x26;emsp;Eric
