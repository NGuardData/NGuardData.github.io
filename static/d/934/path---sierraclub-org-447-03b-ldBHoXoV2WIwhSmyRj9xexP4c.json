In 2016, Sierra received over $100 million in contributions and grants, according to its IRS forms listing its revenue. An elected board of directors oversees the Sierra Club’s policy decisions and governance.</p>\n<p>SierraClub.org does not run advertisements. It solicits private donations on the site. In 2018, a banner at the top of the site was titled “Fight Back. Protect America From Trump” with a “Donate Now” prompt. The website also sells Sierra Club clothing, kids’ dolls and toys, mugs, and outdoor gear through an online store.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Sierra magazine publishes bimonthly in print and every day online, featuring stories about climate and energy, wilderness preservation, green lifestyles, and other topics related to protecting the natural world. The magazine describes itself as “storytelling arm of the Sierra Club” and states that it  “convey[s] the ideals at the heart of the Sierra Club’s mission.” Those ideals include commitments to “protect the wild places of the earth” and to “promote the responsible use of the earth’s ecosystems and resources.”</p>\n<p>Sierra Club’s content includes text commentary and reporting, photography, illustrations, and video. Stories from 2018 include, “The Case for Climate Reparations,” which raised questions of who should pay for climate-change-related disasters, and “Pollution Makes the Personal Political,” which was about a California teenager who ran for city council and won, because he wanted to clean up the air in his town. The Adventure section includes illustrated stories to answer questions from readers about surviving in the wilderness, and also publishes reviews of outdoor gear. The Green Lifestyle section addresses issues of living a more environmentally friendly life.</p>\n<p>Content is labeled in many different categories, including as “News,” “Most Popular,” and in sections such as Compass, which focuses on clean energy.  The site also publishes press releases on its activism, including a 2018 voter guide it sent to its 3 million-plus members. It publishes information about specific environmental campaigns, such as the reduction of the use of coal.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Sierra Club articles and videos all include a clearly stated, politically liberal and pro-environment perspective, which is reflected in the organization’s mission statement and “Who We Are” statement on the site. Stories favor one side of issues while acknowledging the opposing position.</p>\n<p>Sierra Club staff, including officials pursuing specific campaigns for the group, and contributing writers produce much of the content for SierraClub.org. Contributors are often environmental experts or reporters with extensive backgrounds in environmental reporting and produce in-depth explanatory reporting. Headlines are generally straightforward and represent the content in the stories.</p>\n<p>Stories that cite research or other news events often link to other news sources, such as the BBC, or original research.</p>\n<p> Sierra Club staff who are specifically involved in campaigns referred to in some articles are identified. For example, a 2018 story, “Cause for Hope: We’re On Track To Move Beyond Coal,” identifies the writer as the director of the Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign, at the article’s end.</p>\n<p>Sierra’s corrections policy states that it “strives to publish accurate information and to acknowledge and correct errors” and that “when factual corrections are made to an article, that fact is noted and the change(s) are detailed.” Corrections are noted both at the bottom of stories, in italics, and on a separate page which contains a running list of past corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Sierra names and provides information about the authors of its stories. The magazine names its editors and provides biographies. Content either carries bylines and contact information for a staff member or information about the Sierra Club chapter that produced it.</p>\n<p>The site reveals ownership and also provides a detailed list of policies, including one about the acceptance of gifts, which states that “the principal basis for making a gift should be the desire on the part of the donor to support the mission, programs, and objectives of the Sierra Club.” According to the policy, the executive director reviews all gifts that exceed $100,000.</p>\n<p>Sponsored content is clearly distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>John Muir, a Scottish-American preservationist, founded Sierra Club in 1892.</p>\n<p>In 2012, Time magazine exposed that Sierra Club had secretly accepted over $25 million between 2007 and 2010 for its “Beyond Coal” campaign from people associated with a large oil and gas company. Sierra Club said it would no longer accept donations from individuals or companies in the natural gas industry.</p>\n<p>In 2013, the Sierra Club’s executive director, Michael Brune, announced that for the first time, the Sierra Club would “participate in an act of peaceful civil resistance” to oppose the Keystone XL pipeline. Brune was arrested, along with other activists.</p>\n<p>Sierra Club pursues advocacy through other avenues, including lawsuits. In 2017 and early 2018, Sierra Club sued the Environmental Protection Agency for failure to respond to requests for information and records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In May 2018 Sierra Club successfully secured more than 24,000 pages of EPA emails, calls logs, and documents through successful litigation under FOIA.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan
