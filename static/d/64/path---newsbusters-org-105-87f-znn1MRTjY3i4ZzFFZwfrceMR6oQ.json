NewsBusters.org also runs advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site is focused on critiquing major news organizations and media figures it views as liberal, as well as Democratic politicians, celebrities, and other public figures. It publishes original written and video content, the latter from MRCTV.org, the MRC’s multimedia wing. Headlines range from “Breaking: Advertisers Flee Vulgar Samantha Bee After Obscene ‘C**t’ Attack” to “Mindy Kaling Calls Trump ‘Delusional,’ Says Society has ‘Limited Room’ for Women.”</p>\n<p>NewsBusters publishes a newsletter every weekday chronicling what it calls the “[l]atest instances of leftist media bias.” It also participates in the MRC’s annual “DisHonors Awards” gala, which the organization says recognizes “the most outrageously biased liberal reporters,” with awards such as the “Kathy Griffin Celebrity Dumbass Award.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Most of NewsBusters.org’s reporting is fact-based. However, the site has misrepresented the content in some of the media outlets it critiques, has misreported statistics, and has relied on questionable sources of information, including propaganda websites associated with white nationalists. Therefore, NewsGuard has determined that NewsBusters does not gather and present information responsibly.</p>\n<p>A June 2018 article headlined “Just in Time to Embarrass Trump, New York Times Reports North Korea's a Dictatorship,” for example, states that the Times failed to report on human rights abuses perpetrated by the North Korean state until President Trump’s June 2018 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The NewsBusters’ story provides two examples of New York Times articles (from February 2018 and March 2013) that it says are not sufficiently critical of North Korea as proof of what it calls the newspaper’s “long history of ignoring the dictatorial nature of the North Korea regime.” </p>\n<p>However, NewsGuard found multiple examples of articles from the Times<em> </em>published prior to the June 2018 summit that were critical of the North Korean government. A July 2017 article, for example, “Mapping the Brutality of North Korea, and Where the Bodies Are Buried,” describes that nation’s “widespread human rights violations.” A November 2014 Times story reported that the United Nations Human Rights Commission said North Korea was responsible for “egregious crimes, including widespread killing, starvation and torture in a penal system that has incarcerated tens of thousands.”</p>\n<p>Asked about the site’s claim about The New York Times’s North Korea coverage, Tim Graham, executive editor of NewsBusters, told NewsGuard in an email: “I see your point about the headline saying ‘Just in time’ when there were previous Times stories from a few months ago. I'm sure the writer is referring to a longer time frame.”</p>\n<p>A June 2017 NewsBusters story headlined “Bustle: Ivanka, 'Most Dangerous Thing To Feminism'… Because Of What, Exactly?” misreported the results of a 2016 poll on abortion commissioned by the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic organization, and conducted by Marist College. The story, which takes issue with a claim that Ivanka Trump cannot be considered a feminist if she does not publicly defend abortion rights, says that “60 percent of adult American women consider themselves ‘very pro-life,’” linking to the Marist poll.</p>\n<p>However, that is not what the Marist poll found. Out of all the women polled, 41 percent, not 60 percent, said they considered themselves pro-life while 55 percent identified themselves as pro-choice. The poll did find that of the women who identified as pro-life, 60 percent said they “strongly support the pro-life view.” But the poll did not find that 60 percent of adult women consider themselves “very pro-life.” </p>\n<p>Graham did not respond to an email from NewsGuard seeking comment on the Marist poll story.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard found that some stories published in the past reference dubious sources. A July 2016 story on race relations in the U.S., for example, said that President Barack Obama “had (and still has) a negative view of this country, its origins, and its standing” and “spent his formative years with an avowed communist mentor.” The phrase “its origins” linked to a post on a news forum claiming that Obama, speaking about the national anthem, said “It should be swapped for something less parochial and less bellicose. I like the song 'I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing.' If that were our anthem, then I might salute [the flag].'”  </p>\n<p>President Obama never said this. The quotation comes from an October 2007 satire column on the website The Arizona Conservative.</p>\n<p>Another phrase in the NewsBusters story, “avowed communist mentor,” linked to an unsubstantiated story on inquisitr.com headlined “Communist Mentor Frank Marshall Davis Is President Obama’s Real Father?” (Obama’s half brother fueled the theory when he commented that he thought Obama resembled Davis, a journalist and poet.)</p>\n<p>In July 2018, Media Matters for America, a left-leaning nonprofit, reported that Tom Blumer, at the time a contributing editor at NewsBusters, had written two stories for the site that included links to websites associated with white nationalism. After Media Matters published its report, NewsBusters removed the links from the stories in question and added editor’s notes to each saying that “NewsBusters does not associate with known white nationalists.”</p>\n<p>Blumer’s profile on the site now refers to him as a former contributing editor. Graham did not respond to an email from NewsGuard seeking comment about Blumer. An email to Blumer about the incident was not answered..</p>\n<p>NewsBusters’ tagline, “exposing and combating liberal media bias,” makes its conservative point of view clear. However, some stories cherry pick or misstate facts to advance the site’s political beliefs, which is why NewsGuard has determined that NewsBusters does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. An August 2018 story, for example, criticized broadcast networks for not covering a speech delivered by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in which he said that America “was never that great.” The story, published the day after Cuomo made the speech, said that “ABC and CBS have ignored [Cuomo’s remarks] altogether.”</p>\n<p>NewsGuard found that CBS did cover the incident on CBS Morning News, however, which is broadcast nationally. During the August 16, 2018, program, the day after Cuomo’s speech, guest anchor Nikki Battiste said that “Andrew Cuomo is being criticized after making a controversial remark about America’s greatness during a speech yesterday.” Graham did not respond to an email from NewsGuard seeking comment about the story.</p>\n<p>NewsBusters posts corrections to stories either in the headline or in the text of the article. Graham said of the site’s approach to corrections, “We don't have a posted Corrections policy, but when I feel we have gotten something flat-wrong, we correct/append, especially when someone puts an erroneous claim in a headline.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site’s About page discloses its relationship with the MRC. It also lists the site’s staff, including its editorial team and contributing writers. Writers’ bylines link to profiles, which sometimes include email addresses and social media information. The site also has a contact form that allows visitors to send comments or suggestions to specific MRC departments.</p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The MRC was founded in 1987 by L. Brent Bozell III, a conservative writer and activist who also founded the Parents Television Council. Its News Analysis Division, the group behind the newsbusters.org site, began in the same year. The site was launched in August 2005.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nNina Zweig\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Eric
