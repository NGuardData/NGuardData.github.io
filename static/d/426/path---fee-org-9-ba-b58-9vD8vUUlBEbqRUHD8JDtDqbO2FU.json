According to its 2017 annual report, it received nearly $4 million in contributions and grants in 2017, representing about 80 percent of its total revenue, with most of the rest coming from investment income.</p>\n<p>FEE does not disclose its donors on its website, nor are their identities disclosed in its published annual report and financial statements. (There is no legal requirement that nonprofits publicly identify individual donors.) Some nonprofits are required to report donors names to the IRS. In June 2018, FEE.org republished a blog post by economist Daniel Mitchell arguing that nonprofits should not be required to report donors’ names to U.S. tax authorities for fear of “government persecution.”</p>\n<p>FEE.org does not run advertising. It features an online store selling books and branded accessories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site states that its mission is to advance “individual liberty, free-market economics, entrepreneurship, private property, high moral character, and limited government.” FEE.com contains articles addressing economics, politics, and culture from a libertarian, pro free-market perspective. Some articles are original, while others are drawn from websites of like-minded organizations, including the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation.</p>\n<p>Most articles are opinion pieces, arguing, for example, against the welfare state and in favor of abolishing Trump administration trade tariffs. The site also contains information about events, programs, and publications offered by FEE.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>FEE.org is clear about its ideological stance, and articles on FEE.org are typically well written and rigorously argued. The site makes clear when content has been aggregated from elsewhere, and links to the original publication. Its articles are regularly reproduced or referenced by credible third-party news outlets such as Newsweek, Bloomberg, and Yahoo News. (FEE.org publishes under a creative commons license, allowing third parties to replicate its work free of charge.) Headlines are straightforward and reflect the content of articles.</p>\n<p>FEE.org does not post a corrections policy, although the site’’s Help Center enables readers to submit corrections to <a href=\"mailto:typos@fee.org\" style=\"color:inherit;text-decoration:inherit\">typos@fee.org</a>. Responding to a request for comment, Tyler Brandt, a fellow at the site, said: “For [informational errors] we either change the text of the article or include an editor’s note at the bottom. We usually include an editor’s note if the error was severe, though this doesn't happen often.” He sent NewsGuard an example of an article corrected in this way from October 2018.</p>\n<p>However, the only similar example of a correction that NewsGuard could find was dated in May 2012. Because the site does not make it immediately clear how to report errors of fact, and does not appear to regularly issue corrections, NewsGuard has determined that FEE.org does not meet its standards for publishing corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site provides biographical and contact information for its leadership and staff, as well as academics associated with the organization through a nationwide Faculty Network. Articles carry author names, linking to contact and biographical information. The site’s About page features information about its Board of Trustees, its annual reports, and financial information such as 990 tax forms. None of these disclosures include the names of donors.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>FEE was founded in 1946 by Leonard E. Read, an advocate of limited government. In its early years, FEE was associated with prominent free-market economists such as Friedrich von Hayek and Milton Friedman. Between 1956 and 2016, it published print magazine The Freeman.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJon Allsop\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Eric
