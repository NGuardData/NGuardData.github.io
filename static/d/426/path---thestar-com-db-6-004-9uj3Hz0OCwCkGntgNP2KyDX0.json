Thestar.com generates revenue from advertisements and paid subscriptions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Thestar.com publishes news from Toronto, the nation’s capital of Ottawa, and throughout Canada. It also covers news from the United States and other countries. The site covers government, politics, crime, business, sports, and entertainment, including many book, film, music, and television reviews. Coverage of Canada is supplemented by the Canadian Press wire service.</p>\n<p>An investigative section titled “Star Investigations” has included reports on doctors who try to cover up misdeeds, the difference between organic and conventional milk in Ontario, and an examination of money laundering in Toronto’s real estate market. The site publishes an additional section titled “Story Behind The Story,” which offers a look at the paper’s investigative process.</p>\n<p>Full access to the site’s content requires a paid subscription.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Thestar.com’s staff produces in-depth and thoroughly sourced journalism, based on firsthand reporting, public documents, and beat reporting. Thestar.com regularly publishes corrections, often as standalone articles that explain the reason for the error. The About Us page provides contact information for readers wishing to report an error, and states, “Mistakes will happen. When they do, we correct our errors.”</p>\n<p>The Toronto Star regularly wins National Newspaper Awards in Canada, including four in 2018 for best business reporting, best explanatory reporting, best long feature, and best sports photo. The business award recognized its examination into the tax havens revealed as part of the Panama Papers expose with other journalism organizations worldwide. Science reporter Kate Allen was lauded for explanatory work in a project that documented the effects of climate change on living things on the planet other than humans, such as trees and bugs.</p>\n<p>In 2018 Star investigations were cited for first place awards by the Canadian Association of Journalists. “Undercover in Temp Nation,” a look at the death of a 23-year-old temporary worker inside an industrial bakery, won the labor reporting category. The paper also won for “Motherisk,” a partnership with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which inspected how a children’s hospital laboratory performed tests for child welfare providers that were critical in decisions to remove children from their families. The tests have been discredited, the lab closed, and the cases placed under review though many of the decisions about the children cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>Opinion articles are separate from news content. The site publishes an ethics policy and detailed journalistic standards, as well as references to the Atkinson Principles, created by Joseph E. Atkinson, who served as the paper’s publisher from 1899 to 1948. The principles state that “a progressive newspaper should contribute to the advancement of society through pursuit of social, economic and political reforms.” These principles label the Toronto Star as a progressive, socially liberal publication that, at times, advocates for political issues such as “free speech and the right to public assembly,” according to a November 2017 Toronto Star article. Its editorials have reflected those values, and the newspaper has endorsed liberal politicians such as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The website’s About Us page provides information about the paper’s ownership, its ethics policy and journalistic standards, including rulings on possible conflict of interest issues. It also lists the paper’s managerial staff.</p>\n<p>The site’s Contact Us page offers contact information for the newsroom, the editor, and different editorial departments. Articles are published with the name of their author, and feature their biographical and contact information.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>In 1892, The Toronto Evening Star was launched by printers and teenage apprentices who were locked out by management during a labor dispute at the afternoon News. In 1899, it appointed Joseph Atkinson as editor. Raised by a widowed mother with eight children, Atkinson confronted hardship when she died, left school at age 14 to work in a wool mill, and relied on public charity after the mill burned down. He found work as a clerk at a newspaper and rose to editor positions. In 1900, he re-launched the Evening Star as the Toronto Daily Star (it became the Toronto Star in 1971). His Methodist upbringing and confrontations with hardship fashioned his own liberal ideology, which was imbued in the paper’s trademark populist cast. He was a Liberal Party member, with the paper publishing many articles on social welfare in other nations, and Atkinson playing a role in creation of Canada’s welfare system.</p>\n<p>In 1900, the Evening Star was relaunched as the Toronto Daily Star, which was renamed the Toronto Star in 1971. Atkinson died in 1948, with his will leaving the paper to a charitable foundation he founded, with the paper and foundation overseen by trustees who would heed his core beliefs and ideology. A later change in Ontario tax law, regarding foundation ownership of profit-making enterprises, prompted a group of trustees to buy the paper in 1958.</p>\n<p>Thestar.com’s domain was registered in 1995.
