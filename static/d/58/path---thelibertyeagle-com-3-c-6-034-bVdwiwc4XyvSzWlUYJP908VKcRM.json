We promise not to misinform or waste your time ever.”</p>\n<p>The site does not publish original reporting, instead reposting articles from other websites or relating what other outlets are reporting, sometimes with added commentary. Stories center on politics, culture, and the media, covered from a conservative perspective. On a typical day, articles run under headlines such as “Red Sox Pitcher Supports Trump, Stuns Media;” “Trump Slams GQ Writer Who Says He ‘Radicalized’ More People Than ISIS;” and “MSNBC Reporter Surprised to Find Hispanics Supporting Republicans.”</p>\n<p>The Liberty Eagle pulls content from a variety of sources, including mainstream news outlets, such as Reuters, and the news sites of local television stations. The site also relies on content from sources known to publish false and misleading information, including InfoWars.com and Gateway Pundit.</p>\n<p>All articles appear to be filed under the Politics category, regardless of subject matter. The other categories link to outside sites: Books leads to an Amazon page for a children’s book, Liberty the Eagle, written by a writer associated with the site. Photos link to the site’s Instagram page, and Liberty Ladies features Instagram images that the site describes as “beautiful conservative ladies that continue the fight for liberty and who aren’t afraid to show they’re [sic] pro-life, pro-gun &#x26; pro-constitution views.” The site also has an online store.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Most stories appear to have been copied in part or entirely from other news outlets, often without clear attribution. For example, an October 31, 2018, article headlined “Sheriffs Putting ‘No Trick-or-Treat’ Signs on Homes of Sex Offenders” was copied from a USA Today story published the previous day. The site does not link to the original article and does not attribute the post to USA Today. Another article published in October, headlined “Hillary on Mix Up of Booker &#x26; Holder: ‘I Know They All Look Alike,’” was copied from the Washington Examiner, without attribution. In both cases, only the headline was changed.</p>\n<p>Stories often contain false or misleading information. For example, an October 2018 story about billionaire Democratic philanthropist George Soros states: “When does Nazi war criminal George Soros get arrested? This guy is behind every bit of domestic terrorism there is in the U.S.” The Liberty Eagle post is based on a Gateway Pundit article that includes no support for the claim that Soros is a war criminal who backs domestic terrorists. The Hungarian-born Soros is Jewish and was 14 when the World War II ended. He has been a frequent target of conspiracy theories suggesting he collaborated with Nazi occupiers in Hungary, and photos have circulated that some claim are of a young Soros in an SS uniform. These claims have been debunked by major fact-checking organizations and news outlets.</p>\n<p>A November 2018 story, “Judicial Watch Demands Criminal Investigation into Soros Funding of Caravan,” perpetuates another conspiracy theory about Soros. Citing InfoWars.com, the story claimed that Soros was “funding the migrant caravan heading to the U.S. border.” No credible evidence backing that claim has emerged, although it has been widely circulated. A Judicial Watch staff member who made the claim during an interview on Fox Business in October 2018 was banned from returning to the network, according to the Los Angeles Times and other news outlets.</p>\n<p>A September 2018 story, headlined “Profiles in Treason James Comey Part 2,” referred to President Obama as “our Muslim-in-chief President Barack Hussein Obama” -- embracing the conspiracy theory that President Obama is Muslim. The article has since been deleted.</p>\n<p>Because TheLibertyEagle.com regularly reposts unattributed and unreliable content,  NewsGuard has determined that it does not gather and present information responsibly. Additionally, because the site publishes baseless or discredited rumors and conspiracies, NewsGuard has determined that the site repeatedly publishes false information.</p>\n<p>TheLibertyEagle.com does not have a stated corrections policy and NewsGuard was unable to find corrections on the site.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard sent questions about the site’s editorial practices to the general email address listed on the site, support@thelibertyeagle.com, and received responses, although the person who responded declined to identify themselves. NewsGuard has concluded that the person who responded is associated with the site and is therefore including those comments. Asked about the site’s tendency to copy unsourced content from other sites, the Liberty Eagle staff member told NewsGuard in an email: “We do give credit to the source of where text is taken from in the post” and that “There is a link to the original content, unless the link on the particular article isn’t working.” Asked about the “Profiles in Treason” article, the staff member told NewsGuard that the story was an “editorial” done by a writer who is no longer at the website.</p>\n<p>The respondent did not reply to a follow-up NewsGuard email pointing out cases in which thelibertyeagle.com had failed to give credit to sources and did not respond when asked for comment on the website’s inaccurate claims about George Soros.</p>\n<p>Asked about the site’s approach to corrections, the staff member said that “the website does run corrections,” but could not provide any examples because “the edits/corrections are published immediately.” The respondent acknowledged that the site does not post notices informing readers that a story has been corrected.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles do not include the name of the writer and are credited to “The Liberty Eagle,” although the articles are largely produced by other sites. The site does not disclose information about its owners, leadership, or editorial staff, nor does it provide contact information beyond a general email address. </p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<p>The Liberty Eagle staff member stated in an email that some authors on the site are named, but no examples of that were provided. The respondent confirmed that the site does not provide ownership information, but declined to explain why.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site’s domain was registered in April 2014. While the oldest articles on the site are dated February 2017, NewsGuard has found archived editions of the site, using the same logo, dating back to May 2014.</p>\n<p><em>Corrections: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label incorrectly stated that an article on the site about a sheriff marking sex offenders’ homes on Halloween linked to the original USA Today article. There was no link. Also, the label misstated the network on which a Judicial Watch staff member appeared; it was Fox Business, not Fox News.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBron Maher\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie
