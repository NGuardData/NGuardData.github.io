It is also financed in large part by billionaire Republican mega-donor Paul Singer, according to The New York Times.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>When the website was founded, editor Matthew Continetti wrote that it would “scrutinize the left’s claims with the same adversarial techniques that the left uses to cover the right.” </p>\n<p>Stories cover major news events, often running articles that oppose liberal causes or promote conservative ones. The same is true of opinion pieces. On July 18, 2018, the site ran stories including “77 Times Barack Obama Was Totally Wrong,” “Dem Candidate Claims Credit for ‘Creating’ Paid Family Leave Program He Didn’t Start,” and “California Gas-Tax Repeal Organizers See Rallying Point for GOP Voters.” The Beacon also features a news discussion podcast and an annual “Men of the Year” feature.</p>\n<p>Many articles include aggregated information from other news outlets, screenshots of tweets, reports on how journalists at other organizations cover stories, or material from wire services, such as Reuters. The site also breaks news through original reporting.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles on freebeacon.com are generally fact-based and cite credible news sources and exclusive interviews. However, a NewsGuard review found that the site often misstates information or cherry picks information in a way that produces stories favoring a conservative viewpoint.</p>\n<p>For example, a July 2018 piece about President Trump’s nominee for Supreme Court Justice, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, headlined, “Editorial Boards in Dem Senators’ States Praise Kavanaugh: ‘Ideal Resume,’ ‘First-Rate Legal Mind,’ ” made various inaccurate assertions. The article claimed that “the editorial board at The Washington Post praised Kavanaugh,” citing quotes from a New York Post article that spoke favorably of Kavanaugh, mixed with quotes from a Washington Post article that was critical of him, but attributing the quotes solely to The Washington Post. The Beacon piece also linked to a Los Angeles Times editorial that it said “praised the judge's experience and intellect.” The Beacon did not directly quote the article, though, whose first paragraph read, “Given the number of fire-breathing right-wing judges that Trump had to choose from, he could have done a whole lot worse.” </p>\n<p>Another July 2018 story stated, “The Denver Post published a letter to the editor suggesting President Donald Trump should be executed for treason.” The reader’s letter, although caustic in tone, did not suggest that the president be executed. It agreed with criticism of his conduct during the July 2018 Helsinki summit meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and stated, “Ethel and Julius Rosenberg were executed on a basis of far less evidence than is had on Trump and many in his administration.” The editorial page editor of the Denver Post disputed The Beacon’s interpretation of the letter, and did not take it down, saying the newspaper would never run a letter suggesting that the president of the United States be executed. The Beacon noted the newspaper’s reply.</p>\n<p>Headlines on the website can misrepresent stories, as happened with a July 2018 article headlined, “McCaskill Says Her ‘Jaw Dropped’ at $1k Cost for GOP Fundraiser With Trump. It Cost $98k to Host Her Fundraiser With Obama.” The headline faulted Senator Claire McCaskill (D-Mo) for professing shock at the cost of her opponent’s fundraiser with President Trump, when her own fundraising event with Barack Obama cost almost 100 times more, or so the headline implied. In fact, the article actually compared the $1,000-per-person cost of attending the GOP fundraiser to a $98,000 donation McCaskill received from the couple that hosted her fundraiser.</p>\n<p>Another July 2018 article ran with the deceptive headline, “Poll: Majority Say Dem Candidates ‘Out of Step’ With Most Americans’ Thinking.” The article started out by highlighting the findings of an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll in which 56 percent of registered voters said that Democratic candidates were “out of step with most Americans' thinking.” Further down in the story, its author revealed that a slightly higher percentage of voters  — 57 percent — saw Republican candidates as “out of step.” That detail was absent from the headline.</p>\n<p>The Washington Free Beacon has been criticized for paying Fusion GPS, a research firm, to unearth damaging information about several Republican presidential candidates from October 2015 through May 2016. Fusion GPS later came under fire for its connection to Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote what came to be known as the Steele dossier, an intelligence report alleging a conspiracy between Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and the Russian government to help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton. The Beacon said in a statement that the information it obtained from Fusion GPS came from public sources, and that it did not use information from the Steele dossier for its political articles.</p>\n<p>The site regularly corrects errors and updates articles when new information emerges.</p>\n<p>The Washington Free Beacon did not respond to four emails from NewsGuard seeking comment on its distortion of facts in articles and headlines and its involvement with Fusion GPS.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site lists its editors, reporters, and senior managers, accompanied by photos and links to biographies and a general email address. Articles typically list bylines providing the same information for writers, but some stories are simply attributed to “Washington Free Beacon Staff.” The Washington Beacon discloses that it is a private, for-profit site in its About Us page. Advertisements are distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The website was founded in 2012 by Michael Goldfarb, a former presidential campaign aide to Senator John McCain (R, AZ); Aaron Harison, former executive director of Keep America Safe, a national security-focused nonprofit; and Matthew Continetti, a former editor at The Weekly Standard, and the Washington Free Beacon’s editor. The founders said they created the Beacon as a conservative version of ThinkProgress, the liberal media site of the Center for American Progress. The Washington Free Beacon was originally run by a nonprofit called the Center for American Freedom, but became a private company in August 2014.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah
