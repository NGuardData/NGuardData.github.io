It describes itself as a nonpartisan organization with the mission “to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties that the Constitution and the laws of the United States guarantee everyone in this country.”</p>\n<p>The ACLU has defended a wide range of groups since it was founded in 1920, from the Ku Klux Klan to Black Lives Matter. Its website explains that, especially with regard to controversial and unpopular groups, “we do not defend them because we agree with them. Rather we defend their right to free expression and free assembly.”</p>\n<p>The ACLU is funded by contributions and grants from individuals and private foundations, and by sales of its merchandise. The organization does not list any individual donors on its annual financial reports. However, SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk, liberal billionaire philanthropist George Soros, and the car service Lyft are among publicly known donors.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The website contains web pages, blog posts, and articles related to the actions and positions of the ACLU. When users first visit the site, a large window pops up urging them to donate. Appeals for contributions, petition signatures, and participation in ACLU actions are prominent.  Content on ACLU.org clearly conveys the organization’s advocacy positions.</p>\n<p>An Issues section states the organization’s position on religious liberty and reproductive freedom, among other topics. A Know Your Rights section informs users of their rights in their interactions with law enforcement, government agencies, and other organizations. The Defending Our Rights segment updates users on the organization’s court cases and public policy advocacy.</p>\n<p>Articles in a Blogs section cover grassroots action, technology, voter rights, and ballot measures. The site also produces video reports on issues of importance to the organization, and posts research documents and digital issues of the ACLU STAND print magazine. Press releases are also posted on the site, outlining developments in the organization’s efforts and official ACLU stances. All content reflects the ACLU’s positions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The ACLU has received the highest level of recognition by Charity Navigator, GuideStar, and Better Business Bureau — three organizations that evaluate nonprofit organizations.</p>\n<p>The ACLU has defended individuals and organizations from both sides of the political spectrum, from civil rights activist Dick Gregory to conservative political commentator Rush Limbaugh, drawing criticism from both the right and the left. The ACLU has received particular criticism for its defense of controversial organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazis. </p>\n<p>In response, the ACLU maintains that “the people whose opinions are the most controversial or extreme are the people whose rights are most often threatened. Once the government has the power to violate one person's rights, it can use that power against everyone. We work to stop the erosion of civil liberties before it's too late.”</p>\n<p>Conservatives and some liberals criticize the ACLU for supporting civil liberties selectively. In 2017, the group announced it would no longer defend protesters who march with firearms, despite Second Amendment protections. Former Democratic and independent U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman in February 2018 objected to the ACLU's decision to spend $25 million to support issue-based electioneering. \"It's not that the left shouldn't have opportunities to speak up against the president's agenda -- of course it should,\" he wrote in a column for The Hill. \"But the ACLU shouldn't be its political bullhorn.\"</p>\n<p>Articles on ACLU.org purport to distinguish news and opinion, because one blog feed is presented as news (Breaking News), and another describes itself as commentary (Speak Freely). However, while the “news” stories cite firsthand accounts, government reports, and reliable media outlets such as NPR and ProPublica, the articles’ headlines are highly opinionated and the content clearly uses news events to convey an opinion. For example, a February 2019 “news” article headlined “ICE Partners Again With a Sheriff It Once Severed Ties With Because of Racial Profiling” presented a one-sided criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump’s immigration policy. “In Trump’s America, law enforcement officials who abuse their authority aren’t investigated, or at least shunned, but rewarded with taxpayer money,” the article stated. The ACLU did not respond to four emails from NewsGuard seeking comment on how the site separates news from opinion.</p>\n<p>The site does not state a corrections policy, but articles are updated when new information arises, and NewsGuard found examples of detailed corrections and clarifications that explained the changes.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>ACLU.org makes clear that it is the website of the nonprofit ACLU. The site’s Financial Info page contains annual reports, Internal Revenue Service 990 forms, and financial audit statements, but the site does not identify any of its major donors, which does not meet NewsGuard’s standard for clearly disclosing financing. The ACLU did not respond to two emails from NewsGuard seeking comment on the site’s disclosure of ownership and financing.</p>\n<p>The site names ACLU leaders, officers, ambassadors, and board members, providing biographies for its leadership team. ACLU.org does not enable users to contact these individuals, but provides an email address, street address, and phone number for the headquarters and each state’s affiliate chapter.</p>\n<p>Stories in the Blogs section name an author, often providing a brief biography and their photo, but rarely provide a method for contacting them.</p>\n<p>The site does not run advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The ACLU was founded in 1920 by civil liberties activists, including Roger Baldwin, Crystal Eastman, and Albert DeSilver. Its inception was prompted by the “Palmer Raids” of 1919 and 1920 during the Red Scare, when thousands of people who were feared to be leftists sympathetic to Bolshevik Russia were unlawfully arrested by the U.S. government. The ACLU exposed the government overreach and helped release hundreds of American anti-war activists, and has since been involved in similar actions.</p>\n<p>In 1925, the ACLU defended John Scopes in the “Scopes Monkey Trial,” a historic Supreme Court case in which Scopes was convicted for teaching evolution in a Tennessee public school, despite a recent state ban. One of the group’s most controversial cases was its 1978 defense of a neo-Nazi group that had been prohibited from marching in Skokie, Illinois, which it argued was a violation of First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This Nutrition Label has been updated and its rating has been changed, to state that ACLU.org does not identify its major donors, which does not meet NewsGuard’s standard for disclosing ownership and relevant financing.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a
