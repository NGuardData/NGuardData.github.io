Myers. In addition to the website, which runs advertising, AccuWeather’s business model is based on providing weather forecasts to other media companies, including television and radio stations and newspapers. The company also has a popular weather app for smartphones.</p>\n<p>Barry Myers, Joel’s brother, serves as the company’s CEO, although he has been nominated by President Trump to serve as head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and has signaled that he would leave the company if confirmed by the U.S. Senate. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Accuweather.com publishes weather forecasts, short news stories about extreme weather events across the country, and other weather-related content, such as an “allergy forecast” and ocean current updates. Sections on the site include Radar &#x26; Maps, News &#x26; Video, Hurricane, and Climate.</p>\n<p>The Climate section closely monitors the effects of rising temperatures, with articles such as “Arctic warming may play a role in more persistent weather patterns in North America;” “Summer weather is stalling, leading to more extremes;” and “Longer summers and irregular weather could harm breathtaking autumn foliage.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>AccuWeather says on its website that it relies on a team of more than 100 meteorologists and other expert sources, including the National Weather Service, to issue its forecasts. Articles are authoritative and measured, and headlines accurately reflect the content.</p>\n<p>The site does not articulate a corrections policy, and NewsGuard did not readily find corrections related to the site’s news articles. </p>\n<p>The company’s director of marketing communications, Rhonda Seaton, said in an email that the corrections the site issues are “typically weather-related and updated with a new timestamp.” Seaton did not address how the site handles corrections in news and feature stories. </p>\n<p>AccuWeather has come under scrutiny from the meteorology community for offering long-term, 45 and 90-day forecasts. Other scientists in the field believe it is not possible to make a reliable prediction that far in advance, but AccuWeather has disputed this claim.</p>\n<p>President Trump’s nomination of CEO Barry Myers to lead the NOAA has caused controversy, as Myers lobbied during his career at Accuweather to weaken the National Weather Services’ ability to provide free forecasts. Myers has once championed a proposal by then U.S. Senator Rick Santorum to stop the National Weather Service from distributing free weather reports. The National Weather Service is a branch of the NOAA. The Union of Concerned Scientists and NOAA’s employee union oppose Myers’ nomination, but it is unclear if that is what has held up his confirmation. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>AccuWeather provides information about the company’s leadership with a link to the company’s corporate site, where the company also provides information on how forecasts are made. News and features stories on Accuweather.com include the name of the writer, and in many cases, a short biography.  </p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>AccuWeather was founded in 1962 by Joel Myers while he worked on his PhD in meteorology. The company is now run by his brother, and Joel remains on the board.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nKatherine Sullivan\n\nEdited by:\nEric Effron&#x26;emsp;Yemile Bucay&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/about\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.accuweather.com/en/about</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://corporate.accuweather.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://corporate.accuweather.com/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/02/revamped-accuweather-app/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wired.com/2014/02/revamped-accuweather-app/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/us/new-york-ny/10007/allergies-weather/349727\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.accuweather.com/en/us/new-york-ny/10007/allergies-weather/349727</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-noaa/white-house-nominates-accuweather-ceo-to-head-climate-agency-idUSKBN1CH08I\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-noaa/white-house-nominates-accuweather-ceo-to-head-climate-agency-idUSKBN1CH08I</a></h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-noaa/white-house-nominates-accuweather-ceo-to-head-climate-agency-idUSKBN1CH08I\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-noaa/white-house-nominates-accuweather-ceo-to-head-climate-agency-idUSKBN1CH08I</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/12/trump-noaa-chief-accuweather-barry-myers-243735\">https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/12/trump-noaa-chief-accuweather-barry-myers-243735</a></h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/12/trump-noaa-chief-accuweather-barry-myers-243735\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/12/trump-noaa-chief-accuweather-barry-myers-243735</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/12/trump-noaa-chief-accuweather-barry-myers-243735\">https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/12/trump-noaa-chief-accuweather-barry-myers-243735</a></h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/12/trump-noaa-chief-accuweather-barry-myers-243735\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/12/trump-noaa-chief-accuweather-barry-myers-243735</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/04/11/accuweather-extends-its-controversial-45-day-weather-forecasts-to-90-days/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.05545b8d30a7\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/04/11/accuweather-extends-its-controversial-45-day-weather-forecasts-to-90-days/?noredirect=on&#x26;utm_term=.05545b8d30a7</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/08/06/accuweather-you-cannot-be-serious-new-45-day-forecasts/?utm_term=.cba8530b72c6\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/08/06/accuweather-you-cannot-be-serious-new-45-day-forecasts/?utm_term=.cba8530b72c6</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-noaa/white-house-nominates-accuweather-ceo-to-head-climate-agency-idUSKBN1CH08I\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-noaa/white-house-nominates-accuweather-ceo-to-head-climate-agency-idUSKBN1CH08I</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/article197821519.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/article197821519.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-blogs/abrams/florida-bracing-for-irma-while-the-northeast-turns-cool-and-dry/70002665\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-blogs/abrams/florida-bracing-for-irma-while-the-northeast-turns-cool-and-dry/70002665</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/personalities/kristina-pydynowski\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.accuweather.com/en/personalities/kristina-pydynowski</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/03/20/meet-the-man-who-brings-you-the-weather/\" target=\"_blank\">https://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/03/20/meet-the-man-who-brings-you-the-weather/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"accuweather.com","author":"Katherine Sullivan","date":"2018-10-04T16:10:48.007+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/accuweather.com/"}}
