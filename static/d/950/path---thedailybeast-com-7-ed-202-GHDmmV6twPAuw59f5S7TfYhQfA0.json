Irreverent. Intelligent.” and “Always skeptical but never cynical.”</p>\n<p>The site brings a liberal perspective to its coverage, especially about politics, with the subtitle on its Politics section stating: “Non-Partisan, but Not Neutral.” The Daily Beast’s opinion content is often pointed in tone, and many are highly critical of U.S. President Donald Trump. For example, a commentary by Rick Wilson, an anti-Trump Republican political strategist, was headlined: “Trump’s Negotiating Style Is Pure Art of the Moron.” </p>\n<p>In addition to its own content, the site sometimes runs news articles aggregated from other media outlets. For example, a Daily Beast story summarized and linked to an article from The Hill headlined “Watchdog: Chemical Weapons ‘Very Likely’ Used in 2017 Syria Attack.” Other news providers whose work appears on the site include ABC News, Reuters, and The New York Times. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles generally cite multiple, named sources, and headlines typically reflect articles’ content. Opinion pieces are clearly labelled.</p>\n<p>The site contains a corrections policy, which states: “Factual errors require correction and acknowledgement by an editor at the end of the story. Updating text for clarity, style or spelling does not require acknowledgement. When a story has advanced significantly within a week of publication, an update may be added.”</p>\n<p>NewsGuard found several examples of published corrections, which are marked at either the top or bottom of stories with phrases including “editor’s note” and “correction.”</p>\n<p>Unrelated instances of plagiarism at The Daily Beast have prompted the resignations of two reporters. In 2010, a Slate article sparked an internal investigation into work published by Daily Beast chief investigative reporter Gerald Posner. Several of Posner’s articles included material he had copied from other media outlets without attribution. The Daily Beast responded to the accusations promptly, acknowledging that Posner had plagiarized, and he was suspended during an investigation into his past work. Posner ultimately resigned, acknowledging his mistakes saying, “There is no excuse...I take full responsibility,” according to Slate. </p>\n<p>A similar situation occurred in 2018, leading to the resignation of Daily Beast reporter Lizzie Crocker. The copied material was first publicized by New York Times Magazine contributing writer Thomas Chatterton Williams, who tweeted a side-by-side comparison of an article by Crocker with passages that first appeared in The Weekly Standard.</p>\n<p>In response, The Daily Beast deleted that article and posted an editor’s note stating the story “violated The Daily Beast’s Code of Ethics and Standards and has been removed.” Other articles by Crocker were also found to be lifted in part from other sources and were also deleted by the site. Crocker did not return requests for comment from several news organizations that covered the story. She did not return a request for comment NewsGuard sent her via a Facebook message.</p>\n<p>In 2015, The Daily Beast published another widely publicized correction for a story that incorrectly identified the suspected shooter in a San Bernardino, California, terrorist attack. In its story, The Daily Beast published a Facebook photo and details about the wrong person, who has the same name as the suspect.  Hours later, the site posted a correction at the top of the story, acknowledging the mistake. That page no longer exists on The Daily Beast website. </p>\n<p>The publication’s executive editor, in a statement to Gawker, said of the mistake: “Obviously, we are mortified that we identified the wrong Syed R. Farook. Once we realized there was a problem with our story, we moved as quickly as we could to correct the piece.”</p>\n<p>Despite these missteps, NewsGuard has determined that The Daily Beast generally reports the news fairly and responsibly -- given the overall quality of the site and editors’ prompt response to the instances of plagiarism and other problems.</p>\n<p>The site has won numerous awards in recent years, including the Webby in 2012 and 2013 for best news site; three New York Press Club Journalism Awards in the internet publishing categories of entertainment news, crime reporting, and travel writing; and four Los Angeles Press Club National Arts and Entertainment Journalism Awards in 2017.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Readers can click on author names to see a writer’s email address and often a short biography. The Contact page links to The Daily Beast’s “Code of Ethics and Standards,” which explains its mission: “to confront bullies, bigots and hypocrites. We believe that skepticism is a virtue and cynicism is a vice. Above all, our goal is to tell the truth.”</p>\n<p>The extensive policy states its processes for using anonymous sources, attributing information, and issuing corrections and deletions.</p>\n<p>The Contact section provides several email addresses for directing editorial and other inquiries. It also offers ways to submit news tips using secure methods such as Signal, an encrypted instant messaging and phone app.  </p>\n<p>The About page lists the publication’s editors along with biographies and methods of contacting them.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site launched in 2008 with founding editor-in-chief Tina Brown at the helm. Brown previously held top editing posts at Vanity Fair and The New Yorker.  She left the site in 2013 after The Daily Beast parent company IAC made a failed attempt to merge The Daily Beast and Newsweek.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nDouglas Rowe\n\nEdited by:\nJoyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
