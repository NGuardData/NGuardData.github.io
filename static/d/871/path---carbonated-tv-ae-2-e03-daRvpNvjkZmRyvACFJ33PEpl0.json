Kahn is also founder and CEO of Netpace, a software consulting firm. The website earns revenue from advertising.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Content reflects liberal political views and a self-described mission to tell “inspirational, informative and uplifting stories that mainstream media may not necessarily report.” Stories, which are sourced from established media outlets, frequently cover challenges facing poor and underprivileged communities worldwide. Examples include, “Theater Kicks Out Mom, Disabled Son For ‘Making Too Many Happy Noises,’” “Trump Cuts $25 Mln In Aid For Palestinians in East Jerusalem Hospitals,” and “Non-Citizen? Chances Are Bank Of America Will Freeze Your Account.” News stories cover current events and politics. The site also publishes stories about animals endangered, harmed, or killed by people.</p>\n<p>Carbonated.TV covers entertainment news, including stories about actors, musicians, and popular TV shows. The Lifestyle section features stories about health topics. The site publishes videos and photographs, which it takes from sources such as Reuters and Twitter.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Although an About Page states that “Our work unites people of all kinds, building bridges across party lines, religions, and classes,” political coverage is often liberal and focuses on perceived missteps of President Donald Trump. Examples include news stories about Trump’s animosity toward the late Sen. John McCain, and a letter that one of Trump’s lawyers, Rudolph Giuliani, wrote to the president of Romania, which contradicted U.S. foreign policy. Headlines are generally fair and balanced.</p>\n<p>Carbonated.TV does not distinguish between news and opinion. For example, an August 2018 news story about a Trump campaign stop in Indiana stated, “The rally included the usual boasts and rants such as the president taking credit for making the current U.S. economy the best in the ‘history of our country,’ which, by the way, is not true. At all.” In another story labeled as news, the headline was “Bernie Sanders Reminds The World That Trump Is A ‘Pathological Liar.’ ”</p>\n<p>Reporting often links to established outside sources, such as The New York Times, Reuters and The Guardian. Carbonated.TV does not produce any original videos despite a company profile which states that the website provides “original entertaining programming.” The Carbonated.TV logo appears in every video on the site, although videos are taken from other media organizations, TV programs, and YouTube.</p>\n<p>Carbonated.TV does not state its corrections policy, but NewsGuard has independently verified that the site does publish corrections. It did not respond to NewsGuard’s two emails seeking comment about how it distinguishes between news and opinion.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Carbonated.TV names the authors of stories, but does not provide information about them. The site does not disclose the names of its owners, editors, or senior staff. Carbonated.TV did not respond to NewsGuard’s two emails seeking comment on why it does not provide information about its owners, writers, and editorial leadership.</p>\n<p>Advertising on the site is clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>According to a press release in Business Wire, Carbonated.TV “has been in business” since 2009. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan
