The organization’s chief counsel is Jay Sekulow, a frequent Fox News guest and attorney who has represented conservative, religious, and anti-abortion groups. In 2017, Sekulow joined President Donald Trump’s defense team in the Special Counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>ACLJ’s 2017 income totaled approximately $57.3 million, according to its Annual Report published on ACLJ.org. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>ACLJ was founded in 1990 “with the mandate to protect religious and constitutional freedoms” and to engage “legal, legislative, and cultural issues by implementing an effective strategy of advocacy, education, and litigation,” according to the site’s mission statement.</p>\n<p>ACLJ.org content includes coverage of ACLJ’s legal advocacy, such as freedom of speech and religious liberty cases argued before the U.S. Supreme Court, and commentary about religion and social justice. ACLJ frequently reports on persecuted Christians around the world, such as those in predominantly Muslim countries, as well as on groups it considers anti-Semitic or anti-Israel. </p>\n<p>In its Petitions section, the site publishes petitions supporting persecuted Christians around the world. Examples include “Protect Nigeria’s Dying Christians from Brutal Persecution” and “Defend China’s Persecuted Christians &#x26; Protect Religious Freedom.” Other petitions advocate for religious liberty in schools and oppose government funding of Planned Parenthood.</p>\n<p>Through its petitions and international affiliates, ACLJ has helped secure the release of several imprisoned pastors around the world, including Andrew Brunson, who was arrested in Turkey in 2016 and released in 2018. In the Get Legal Help section, visitors can fill out a form requesting ACLJ’s advice on constitutional law questions. Sekulow also hosts a radio show called “Jay Sekulow Live” that is streamed on the site. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>ACLJ provides positive coverage of President Trump but does not appear to disclose in stories, or elsewhere on the site, that Sekulow is Trump’s attorney. The site has published stories and radio episodes about the Russia investigation and those involved. For example, in a September 2018 radio segment, titled “Shocking Admission from Former FBI Lawyer: No Collusion,” Sekulow and guests discuss what they characterize as the lack of evidence in the investigation. (The segment was no longer available on the site in late November 2018.) </p>\n<p>ACLJ has also published stories and radio segments about former FBI Director and Trump critic James Comey, including radio shows headlined “The Leakers: James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok &#x26; Lisa Page;” and “James Comey’s Usurpation of Authority” (which were also removed from the site).  A 2017 article written by Sekulow stated that Comey “chose to lie, interfere in the democratic process, and break the law” in his investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails.</p>\n<p>ACLJ.org has published multiple stories and petitions asserting that Planned Parenthood profits from the sale of fetuses, based on videos produced by the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress (CMP) and released in 2015. However, these stories do not mention that the videos CMP presented as full accounts of the activists’ undercover meetings with Planned Parenthood representatives were heavily edited, at times skipping ahead 30 minutes in a few seconds, according to their timestamps, or that the transcripts published with them do not always match the footage. </p>\n<p>Although the tapes do show Planned Parenthood employees discussing costs for fetal tissue, the prices are legal reimbursements to cover the procurement and transportation of the tissue, and do not show that the group “profits” from the practice. Nevertheless, ACLJ has continued to use the CMP videos as a source for articles criticizing Planned Parenthood. For example, in November 2018, ACLJ.org published an article that stated: “In 2015, the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) released a series of videos that showed senior abortion providers openly discussing practices such as profiting from the sale of fetal body parts...”</p>\n<p>Because ACLJ does not disclose Sekulow’s relationship with the Trump administration while regularly commenting on topics and figures related to the Russia investigation, and has distorted information to advance its agenda, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not gather and present information responsibly.  </p>\n<p>The website does not state a corrections policy, and NewsGuard could not find examples of published corrections.</p>\n<p>ACLJ did not respond to NewsGuard’s email, a message sent using the contact form on the site, two phone calls, and one voicemail to discuss the site’s editorial standards and how it handles corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>ACLJ names some of its authors and provides their biographies, but many stories posted on the site are credited only to “ACLJ.org.” Links in the Resources section provides information about ACLJ’s senior attorneys and leadership, which includes Sekulow and his son, Jordan. However, because the site does not appear to disclose Sekulow’s connection to President Trump, NewsGuard has determined the site does not meet its standard for providing information about leadership, including possible conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>The site does not name its major donors or provide ACLJ’s tax documents — thus not meeting NewsGuard’s standard for nonprofits’ disclosure of ownership and financing.  </p>\n<p>ACLJ did not respond to NewsGuard’s email, a message sent using the contact form on the site, two phone calls, and one voicemail seeking comment on its lack of disclosure on its leadership and financing.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Christian televangelist Pat Robertson founded the ACLJ in 1990, and ACLJ.org was registered in 1995. Robertson is also the founder of Regent University and the Christian Broadcasting Network, the home of Christian variety show “The 700 Club.”</p>\n<p>Based on a Washington Post analysis of the organization’s tax filings between 2011 and 2015, the ACLJ received nearly $230 million in donations — with millions going to members of the Sekulow family through a financial arrangement between ACLJ and another nonprofit run by the Sekulows, Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism, or CASE. </p>\n<p>In 2017, Sekulow’s spokesman, Gene Kapp, responded to questions about these payments in a statement published by The Guardian: “The financial arrangements between the ACLJ, Case and all related entities are regularly reviewed by outside independent compensation experts and have been determined to be reasonable. In addition, each entity has annual independent outside audits performed by certified public accounting firms. Further, the IRS has previously conducted audits of the ACLJ and Case and found them to be in full compliance of all applicable tax laws.”</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited
