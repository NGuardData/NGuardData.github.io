Spain remains chief executive and executive chairman of Newser. Newser runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Newser states on its Help page that it “is an online news service that scans Internet news sources and, using human and machine-driven aggregation, delivers the best information in concise, efficient summaries, together with photos, video and audio and links to original stories.”</p>\n<p>Newser states that it chooses which stories to include “based on a proprietary formula that measures the ubiquity of coverage by the top-ranked 100 English-language news sites.”</p>\n<p>Stories cover a broad range of trending topics. In summer of 2018, headlines included “GOP Declares Victory in Tight Ohio Race” (August 2018), “Teen Girl Says Duck-Boat Captain Was 'Freaking Out’” (July 2018), “Russia: OK, Release Our Accused Spy” (July 2018) and “Clashes Break Out After Argentina Abortion Vote” (August 2018).</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Newser employs a team of editors to filter different news sources and repackage them as digestible, two-paragraph articles. The short articles credit the original publication. Newser stories often link to other, earlier Newser stories. Headlines on the site accurately reflect content and Newser has a dedicated opinion section.</p>\n<p>Newser does not include a corrections page or a stated corrections policy, and no corrections could be readily found. Responding to a NewsGuard inquiry about whether Newser runs corrections Newser editor in chief Kate Seamons responded only that Newser has a “report an error” link below each story on the site.</p>\n<p>The site’s editorial approach of writing summaries of other news outlets articles drew criticism during its early years. In 2010, Sharon Waxman, who runs Hollywood site TheWrap.com, claimed that Newser was improperly taking content from other sites. In an article on TheWrap.com titled “Newser.com: Why Michael Wolff &#x26; Co. Are Way Over the Line,” Waxman gave several examples in which, she said, Newser “lifted” content from The Wrap without proper attribution. </p>\n<p>Wolff responded during a CNN interview that “On every story we’ve done over two and a half years, there are at least two links to the original and most often three.” However, Waxman’s article accurately listed several examples of Newser articles that did not attribute any sources.</p>\n<p>There have not been similar public complaints against the site in recent years.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Most articles on Newser name their authors. The site has a prominent Newser Team page naming the website’s founders, board of directors, and editors. Biographical information is provided for the site’s directors and editor-in-chief, but not for the other staff. No contact details are provided for any of the site’s editors. </p>\n<p>Newser's ownership is not disclosed on the website. Wolff’s biography page has not been updated to note his authorship of the 2018 book “Fire and Fury,” a New York Times bestseller describing disarray in the Trump White House. The site does not clarify whether Spain and Wolff are Newser’s proprietors.</p>\n<p>Asked about the lack of disclosure about the site’s ownership, Seamons, the editor in chief,  said Newser is “privately held by a small group of investors.”</p>\n<p>Advertisements on the site are distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Newser was founded in 2007. Co-founder Wolff’s style of journalism has been described as gossipy in outlets including The New Republic, Politico, and The New York Times. In 2018, he came under fire for saying he was “absolutely sure” President Donald Trump was having an extramarital affair before later claiming he did not actually know if this was true. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBron Maher\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/newser\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/newser </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_de/4474983\" target=\"_blank\">https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_de/4474983 </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li>“Read less, know more”</li>\n<li>“Newser is an online news service that scans Internet news sources and, using human and machine-driven aggregation, delivers the best information in concise, efficient summaries, together with photos, video and audio and links to original stories.” - <a href=\"http://www.newser.com/help.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newser.com/help.aspx </a></li>\n<li>“Newser's story selection is based on a proprietary formula that measures the ubiquity of coverage by the top-ranked 100 English-language news sites; the prominence with which those sites feature the stories; and the popularity of a given story with readers; combined with overlooked points of view, angles and scoops uncovered by our editors.” - <a href=\"http://www.newser.com/faqs/storiesfaq.aspx#stories\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newser.com/faqs/storiesfaq.aspx#stories </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mashable.com/2007/08/02/newser/?europe=true\" target=\"_blank\">https://mashable.com/2007/08/02/newser/?europe=true </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newser.com/what-is-newser.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newser.com/what-is-newser.aspx </a></li>\n<li>“Teen Girl Says Duck-Boat Captain Was 'Freaking Out'” (July 2018) <a href=\"http://www.newser.com/story/262277/duck-boat-survivor-the-captain-was-freaking-out.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newser.com/story/262277/duck-boat-survivor-the-captain-was-freaking-out.html </a></li>\n<li>“Russia: OK, Release Our Accused Spy” (July 2018) <a href=\"http://www.newser.com/story/262284/russia-ok-release-our-accused-spy.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newser.com/story/262284/russia-ok-release-our-accused-spy.html </a></li>\n<li>“Fish Oil Pills, Good for the Heart?
