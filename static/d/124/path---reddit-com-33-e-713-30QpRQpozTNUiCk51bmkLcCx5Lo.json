{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<div class=\"right-score\">Score: 0</div>\n<h1>reddit.com&emsp; <span class=\"net-country\">(WEB - en-US)</span></h1>\n<p>A growing collection of online forums that is one of the most visited websites. Reddit’s content, managed largely by volunteers, has contributed to the spread of false information and conspiracy theories.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<p>Reddit is owned by Reddit Inc. Steven Huffman, one of Reddit’s two co-founders, is the corporation’s CEO. Advance Publications, whose properties include Condé Nast, 30 local and regional newspapers, American Business Journals, and a digital marketing agency, is Reddit’s largest shareholder.</p>\n<p>The site earns revenue through advertising, sponsored content, and premium memberships. Reddit announced in February 2019 that it had raised $300 million in series D funding, which included $150 million from Chinese technology company Tencent, increasing the company’s valuation to $3 billion. (Tencent owns the social media platform WeChat.) In 2017, technology news site Recode reported that Reddit raised $200 million in venture capital funding. A previous funding round in 2014 raised $50 million.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Anyone with a Reddit account can post text, videos, images, and links to external websites on the platform, which describes itself as “the front page of the internet.” RedditMetrics.com reported in January 2018 that about 1.2 million online forums, called subreddits, had been created, although as of August 2018 approximately 138,000 were active, according to Reddit’s corporate website. Reddit was the fifth most visited site in the U.S. and the ninth most visited site in the world as of August 2018, according to Alexa rankings. A Pew Research Center study published in February 2016 found that about 71 percent of Reddit users are men. </p>\n<p>Users — who go by names they create on Reddit — often use acronyms popular on the Internet, such as TL;DR (too long; didn’t read) and IMO (in my opinion), as well as terms with a unique meaning on Reddit such as cakeday (the day a user joined the site) and karmawhore (a pejorative term for users who post content simply to earn points, or votes from other users, on Reddit).</p>\n<p>Each subreddit focuses on a specific topic, which can cover anything that doesn’t violate Reddit’s content policy, and is referred to using the last portion of its web address (for example, /r/announcements). There are subreddits on commonplace subjects (/r/science, /r/politics, /r/books), and specific ones (/r/AnimalsWithoutNecks, /r/Random<em>Acts</em>Of_Pizza, /r/lifeofnorman). </p>\n<p>Subreddits include an array of original posts, each generally followed by user comments. Users can comment directly on the original post or on any subsequent comment. Original posts and their comments can be “upvoted” or “downvoted.” Original posts are all given a rank, which is determined by an algorithm. They can also be labeled as inappropriate (“not safe for work” or NSFW”), or as content originally published on Reddit. Subreddits can be marked as “Over 18” if the content is not suitable for a young audience.</p>\n<p>One of Reddit’s most well-known subreddits (/r/AMA) features the site’s Ask Me Anything series. Many high-profile figures have done Reddit AMAs, including former President Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Jerry Seinfeld, and Madonna. Users who do AMAs must provide proof of who they are.</p>\n<p>A 2018 redesign of the site includes a home page that displays content from the subreddits to which each user is subscribed, and links to pages showing popular content on the site and content originally published on Reddit. Users can choose to sort posts based on the categories hot, new, controversial, top, or rising.</p>\n<p>Reddit’s interface has been translated by volunteers into 63 languages, some of which are made up, such as LOL (an interpretation of how a cat might speak English) and Arrrrrrrr! (“pirates’” language). </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Reddit content is regulated by its users, moderators, and administrators, with rules that vary by subreddit. Reddit has a staff of approximately 300 people.</p>\n<p>Volunteer moderators manage each subreddit, and can largely run them as they please. They can create new rules about what content can be posted and how users should conduct themselves, as long as they don’t go against Reddit’s overall content policies. They can remove content they decide is objectionable or off topic, and ban users. Users can appeal a moderator’s decision, and Reddit administrators can take control of a subreddit.</p>\n<p>Any user can create a subreddit after maintaining an account for at least 30 days, acquiring  enough “positive karma” (points earned when others vote on a user’s posts or comments).</p>\n<p>The user that creates a subreddit automatically becomes its moderator, and can ask others to join them.</p>\n<p>Reddit created a content policy in 2015 that it says “provides a lot of leeway in what content is acceptable.” However, it banned content that is illegal, encourages violence, involves sexual content and children, or is threatening or harassing. It doesn’t explicitly ban hate speech. </p>\n<p>The site enforces these rules in a number of ways, which include asking users to stop bad behavior, removing content, suspending accounts, and banning subreddits. Reddit’s values, which include rules written by Reddit users, are often referred to as “reddiquette.”</p>\n<p>Reddit’s content policy does not prohibit the spread of conspiracy theories and false information, which allows such content to proliferate on the site.</p>\n<p>The conspiracy theory known as “Pizzagate,” which claimed that a pedophilia ring run by Hillary Clinton and her aide, John Podesta, was operating out of a Washington pizzeria, gained traction on the mainstream internet after a Reddit user posted a document detailing the “evidence” in November 2016, shortly before the U.S. presidential election. The theory spread widely on social media and in right-leaning outlets such as InfoWars. Subsequently, a man fired a rifle inside the pizzeria, claiming he was there to “self-investigate.” Supporters of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan even used the theory verbally to attack Erdogan’s opponents, claiming Erdogan critics should be more focused on Pizzagate and less on an actual child-abuse scandal at a foundation linked to the Turkish government. Reddit banned the /r/pizzagate subreddit in late-November after users repeatedly posted private information of people they believed were involved in the “conspiracy,” saying “We don’t want witch hunts on our site.”</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, a Reddit user created /r/findbostonbombers, a subreddit intended to host discussion about who was responsible for the attack. Users in this subreddit misidentified multiple people as the perpetrators, including missing Brown University student Sunil Tripathi. Reddit issued a public apology for its role in spreading this misinformation, acknowledging that “some of the activity on Reddit fueled online witch hunts and dangerous speculation.”</p>\n<p>There are also many subreddits on which users attack those who disagree with them, often using hateful language.</p>\n<p>Reddit instituted new rules in 2017 prohibiting the exchange of goods and services such as firearms and falsified documents. These rules banned subreddits such as /r/stealing and /r/DarkNetMarkets.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Reddit users can remain anonymous under the site’s rules. Reddit users, including moderators, are identified by their usernames, which they choose when they sign up for an account on the site. Each subreddit identifies moderators and provides a link at which users can send them private messages. Reddit requires moderators to provide an email address where site administrators can reach them.</p>\n<p>The original author of each post, subreddit moderators, and Reddit administrators are identified with different colors, images, and bold usernames. Original authors are denoted with a microphone next to their username, which is bold. Moderators are identified with a shield and their username in green, and administrators with the site’s mascot, Snoo, and their username in red.</p>\n<p>Reddit Inc.’s website lists Reddit’s executive team, including each employee’s biography. Reddit publishes a transparency report each year regarding requests the site has received for private user information and requests for content removal. Site administrators communicate with users regularly through different subreddits.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Reddit was founded by Huffman and Alexis Ohanian in 2005, during their last year of college at the University of Virginia. They developed the idea that summer at the first Y Combinator, a startup accelerator which has helped launch numerous successful companies.</p>\n<p>The site was acquired by Condé Nast in 2006 and became a subsidiary of Advance Publications, Condé Nast’s parent company, in 2011. Advance re-incorporated Reddit as an independent entity in 2012.</p>\n<p>Huffman and Ohanian left Reddit in 2009, after their contracts with Condé Nast expired, although Ohanian came back as a board member in 2011. The pair returned to Reddit fulltime in 2015, to help revamp the site after controversies over its false content and hate speech.  Ohanian stepped away from his day-to-day role at Reddit in February 2018, but retained his seat on the site’s board.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nMelissa Goldin\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a
