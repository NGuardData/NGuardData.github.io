The website was previously run by Wurzelbacher, a commentator and activist who rose to fame during the 2008 U.S. presidential election, appearing at rallies for Republican candidate John McCain after questioning how Barack Obama’s tax plan would affect the middle class.</p>\n<p>Wurzelbacher told NewsGuard in a January 2019 Twitter message that he was no longer involved with the website, and did not disclose who owns or operates it. A NewsGuard search of website registries and business records from Wurzelbacher’s native Ohio did not find information about JoeForAmerica.com.</p>\n<p>The website runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>JoeForAmerica.com publishes U.S. news stories under five main sections: American Culture, Education, 2nd Amendment, Taxes, and Veterans Affairs. Stories on the homepage are also designated under “Politics” And “First Amendment” tags. Most posts provide conservative commentary on breaking news. Typical headlines in early 2019 included “In Latest Temper Tantrum, Nancy Pelosi Cancels The State Of The Union Address,” “Open Letter To Teenager Who Says The Wall Is Not Needed,” “Ocasio-Cortez Throws A Temper Tantrum After She Is Fact-Checked,” and “Reddit Openly Censoring Trump Supporters.” As of February 2019, three writers were producing the bulk of the website’s content.</p>\n<p>The website also features a section called GUNS &#x26; GEAR, with news on the firearms industry, reviews of weapons, and pro-gun rights commentary. Another section, titled VIDEO OF THE DAY, features articles about videos meant to be shocking or entertaining, which are typically unrelated to politics. Most of the daily videos, however, have not been updated since 2017.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>JoeForAmerica.com rarely reports its own stories. Instead, the site references information reported elsewhere, typically by conservative news and commentary websites such as The Daily Wire and Western Journal. The site does not disclose an overall conservative point of view, although most of its stories are selected to favor that view.</p>\n<p>The site has repeatedly published false and misleading stories, many of which target leading U.S. Democrats. For example, in July 2017, Joe for America called the death in the Miami area of former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein “a Clinton-Linked death” and falsely stated that Eberwein died before he was to testify against the Clinton Foundation. </p>\n<p>Eberwein, who had served as director general of Haiti’s economic development agency, was found dead in a Miami-area motel of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to the Miami-Dade County medical examiner’s office. He had been scheduled to appear the day he was found dead before the Haitian Senate’s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, which was investigating money that Haiti received from a Venezuelan oil-discount program, according to the Miami Herald. The commission was not investigating former U.S. President Bill Clinton’s foundation and Eberwein had no connection to the Clinton Foundation. In 2017 and 2018, fact-checking sites including Snopes and PolitiFact debunked a false article about Eberwein’s death by YourNewsWire.com -- now known as Newspunch.com -- that declared Eberwein was to testify about the Clinton Foundation, and misattributed a quote critical of the Clintons to Eberwein.</p>\n<p>In a March 2017 article, Joe for America published a story headlined “BREAKING: Malik Just Tweeted Out Barack Obama’s Birth Certificate- IT’S NOT FROM HAWAII!” The post showed  photo that purported to be a 1961 birth certificate indicating former President Barack Obama was born in Kenya. “Of course in this world it is hard to tell truth from deceit…but boy does this look real,” the post said. Fact-checking website Snopes wrote in March 2017 that the image is a forgery, noting it says the former president was born in Mombasa, a city that did not become part of Kenya until 1963. A copy of Obama’s Hawaii birth certificate is available on obamawhitehouse.archives.gov. </p>\n<p>Other headlines and stories are misleading and omit key facts and context. For example, a January 2019 story headlined “National Academy of Sciences President Claims Climate Change A Hoax!” stated that the former Academy president, Frederick Seitz, “believed that the issue of global warming is a hoax and therefore the signing of Barrack Obama in the Paris Agreement, is a blunder.” The story fails to state until the final paragraph that Seitz died in 2008, seven years before the U.S. and more than 190 other countries adopted the Paris climate agreement. Another January 2019 post, “California Lawmakers Pass 400% Gas Tax Increase; Give Selves Free Gas And Cars,” appears to reference a policy that had supplied state legislators with taxpayer-funded cars. The policy, which ended in 2011, did not give lawmakers free cars, but allowed them to lease them at a discount. The gas tax increase that was signed into law in 2017 also was not a 400 percent increase. The gas excise tax in California has increased roughly 50 percent from the time that then-Gov. Jerry Brown approved the policy in April 2017 until the time the Joe For America Story was published, state documents show.</p>\n<p>In January 2019, the site published a story headlined “Over 70 Killed In Massachusetts; Refusing To Comply With Gun Confiscation,” that presented events from the American Revolution as if they were current. “National Guard units were ambushed by elements of a Para-military extremist gun rights faction in Massachusetts,” the beginning of the post said. “They were seeking to confiscate a cache of recently banned assault weapons.” Near the end of the post, Joe for America stated, “And this fellow Americans, is how the American Revolution began, April 20, 1775. History. Study it, or repeat it.” The story was not labeled as satire.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard could not locate any correction notices on the website, nor could it find a corrections policy on JoeForAmerica.com.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard has determined that Joe For America publishes false content, does not gather and present information responsibly, or handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly because of its repeated use of false and misleading stories to advance its opinions.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard submitted five inquiries through the site’s Contact form, which were undeliverable, seeking comment about the website’s content, editorial practices, lack of corrections, and disclosure policies. NewsGuard also reached Wurzelbacher through a direct message on Twitter, asking for contact information for the website’s current owner. Wurzelbacher replied to NewsGuard, “I have sent your information on.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The website does not have an About page and does not identify an owner or editor. Posts typically identify their authors by name underneath headlines, and users can link to an author page with an archive of their work. At least three writers appeared to be actively producing content for the site in early 2019. Only one had biographical information available and none offered contact information, which does not meet NewsGuard’s standards for providing information about content creators.</p>\n<p>Advertisements on the website are differentiated from editorial content, and sponsored links are labeled.</p>\n<p>JoeForAmerica.com does not provide contact information for the site and its Contact form does not work.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The JoeForAmerica.com domain name was created in 2012. No registrant name is listed on whois.icann.org. A January 2013 article on Cleveland.com said the website was a joint venture between Wurzelbacher and Liberty Alliance, a conservative news publisher that was acquired in 2017 by Liftable Media, the company behind conservative news sites WesternJournal.com and ConservativeTribune.com.</p>\n<p>Wurzelbacher rose to fame during the 2008 presidential election after speaking with then-presidential candidate Barack Obama about his tax policy during a campaign stop near Toledo, Ohio. Obama’s reply to Wurzelbacher’s question about rising taxes for opening a business -- “I think if you spread the wealth around, it’s good for everybody” -- became a target of Republicans and a theme of McCain’s campaign. Wurzelbacher attended rallies with the Arizona senator, became a media sensation and an “everyman” symbol. </p>\n<p>Wurzelbacher ran for the U.S. House of Representatives’ 9th congressional district seat in Ohio in 2012, winning the Republican primary. He lost to Democrat Marcy Kaptur.</p>\n<p>In March 2016, Reuters reported that Wurzelbacher was still running the website. However, in January 2019, Wurzelbacher told NewsGuard in a Twitter direct message that he was no longer part of JoeForAmerica.com.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSam
