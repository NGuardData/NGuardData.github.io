The domain name is registered through a Arizona-based company called Domains by Proxy, which allows website owners to remain anonymous. It has been used by conservative and liberal sites to shield the identities of registrants. Advertisements and paid content appear on the site. The hosting for the site is credited to Klicked Media, a company linked to several other conservative news sites and linked to what Buzzfeed called a “formidable ad network” for conservative sites called Patriot Ads.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>TruthUncensored.net’s content centers on political, national, and world news written with a conservative point of view. Descriptions like “The Left” are frequent in the site’s stories, alomg with repeating attacks used by President Trump, like asserting that CNN is “fake news.” Conservatives are described in less political, more complimentary terms, such as calling Rush Limbaugh a “radio talk-show star.”</p>\n<p>The writing is especially complimentary of Trump, with authors praising his policies, making his slogans into official-looking terms (i.e. capitalizing “Make America Great.”) while dismissing criticism of him and the investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential campaign. One article says: “How can the president obstruct an investigation that is based on a bogus dossier that was paid for by Hillary Clinton – the entire scenario is ludicrous.”</p>\n<p>Much of the site’s reporting is credited to other sources, including WorldNetDaily and BB4SP, two sites that are included on fact-checking site Politifact’s list of fake news sites. Other stories feature speeches or comments from political figures along with reactions from Twitter users criticizing Democrats and supporting Trump. Older posts speak warmly about Russian President Vladimir Putin, including a 2014 story that said the Russian annexation of Crimea was “to protect the sons and daughters of eastern and southern Ukraine.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>TruthUncensored.net has published stories pushing false claims. Among the debunked claims it has shared are that Sen. John McCain collaborated with North Vietnamese forces while he was a prisoner of war and that police in Charlottesville, Virginia, were told to “stand down” to allow violent clashes during protests on Aug. 12, 2017. The latter story was quickly removed the site but no correction appears to have been issued. No corrections policy appears on the site and no example of a story being corrected were found.</p>\n<p>The site has also published stories about a man named Danney Williams, who claims to be the son of Bill Clinton by an Arkansas prostitute. Time<em> </em>magazine reported in 1999 the claim was proven false in a paternity test, but the claim was revived in 2016 and TruthUncensored’s story refers to Williams definitively as “Bill Clinton’s Black son.” Two emails to the site’s generic contact form about whether corrections were issued for these stories and asking for the site’s  approach to corrections were not returned. </p>\n<p>Writers inject their opinions in most stories. For example, in a July 2018 article about allegations that Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, had been told in the early ‘90s by Ohio State University wrestlers that a team doctor was sexually abusing them and didn’t report the accusations, TruthUncensored.net refers to the story as a “vicious smear campaign by the swamp.”</p>\n<p>Headlines are often sensationalized to attack Democrats or liberals and defend conservatives. For example, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., are both described as “unhinged” in three July 2018 headlines. The sensationalism in headlines can also exaggerate the content of a story. A July 2018 story titled “CNN’s Jim Acosta Caught on Video Manufacturing Very Fake News” shows Acosta shouting a question at President Trump and then asking his cameraman if he got the shot, which TruthUncensored.net’s story argued amounts to a “calculated attempt to deceive, to make it seem as though Trump was asked a direct question and refused to answer.”</p>\n<p>Two emails asking about the site’s sensationalized headlines, history of publishing stories with false claims and how it separates opinion from fact in its stories were not returned.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Most of the site’s content is credited to Lauren Richardson. The URL collecting the stories authored by Richardson mentions “Rebel Rebellion III%,” an alias that appears in the byline for earlier TruthUncensored.net stories. The “III %” is a reference to Revolutionary War-era militias which fought against the British and has been adopted by several groups with aims ranging from defending the right to bear arms to delegitimizing the federal government. No information on editors or those in charge of content is provided.</p>\n<p>The only writer for the site listed it on LinkedIn is Aleen Realmuto, whose past work promoted the debunked “Pizzagate” theory that linked Hillary Clinton to a child sex ring. No contact information for individual authors is provided. The site includes a general contact form, which comes with a warning that using the form will give the site a record of users’ computer’s IP address “for security reasons.” Paid content is labeled on the site but can resemble the site’s regular news stories, with headlines such as “Trump Voters Shocked After Watching This Leaked Video” and “Exclusive New Video Proves Obama’s Presidency Was Totally Invalid. See Why Here.”</p>\n<p>Two emails sent through the site’s contact form asking for more information on its writers, editors and ownership were not returned.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site first appeared in 2014. A now-deleted page said the site was an extension of a Facebook group called “Prepare to Take America Back,” claiming Facebook was censoring the group. The Facebook group under that name, which links to TruthUncensored.net, has also been cited by news organizations as the origin of several false stories promoted by conservative sites.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJohn Gregory\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
