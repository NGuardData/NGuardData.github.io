C-SPAN operates on fees that cable and satellite companies pay to carry it. It receives no government funding and does not run advertisements.</p>\n<p>Along with its website, C-SPAN includes three television stations and one radio station.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>C-SPAN’s site says it provides unfiltered public access to government proceedings -- “without editing, commentary or analysis and with a balanced presentation of points of view.”</p>\n<p>The website’s coverage includes gavel-to-gavel House and Senate floor sessions and hearings, as well as live and taped White House press briefings, speeches, and other public policy events. Video clips posted on the site after they aired add headlines and a few words of introductory text.</p>\n<p>Cameras are not permitted in the U.S. Supreme Court, but the website broadcasts audio of select oral arguments, such as Trump vs. Hawaii, the state’s challenge to the federal travel ban, in April 2018. </p>\n<p>The website also offers videos of authors discussing their books, and experts giving lectures on policy issues on historical topics, archived material, and several series, including discussions on famous Supreme Court cases. Other shows in the morning, including “Washington Journal,” take viewers’ calls and feature lawmakers, journalists and experts discussing key topics of the day.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The website strives for an unvarnished presentation and shuns offering opinions or taking sides. Hearings and other proceedings are broadcast live.</p>\n<p>Headlines are straightforward and fact-based. For example: “Heather Nauert Briefs Reporters At The State Department,” (August 2018) and “Senator Murkowski Meets With Judge Kavanaugh.”</p>\n<p>C-SPAN does not have a corrections policy posted on its website, and it does not show corrections to its video clips. NewsGuard called C-SPAN twice and emailed the network and individual programs seeking comment on how it corrects errors in its broadcast programming, and on the site, but did not receive a response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>C-SPAN’s website includes names, affiliations, and titles of its executive leadership and board of directors. The Contact Us page lists email addresses and phone numbers for the network, as well as contact information for individual programs.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Journalist and then-Cablevision Magazine Washington bureau chief Brian Lamb founded C-SPAN in 1979 as a public service. The network had a reach of 3 million U.S. homes, and is now broadcast in 100 million homes nationwide, according to C-SPAN’s website. </p>\n<p>The network’s initial broadcast was March 19, 1979 -- the first day the House of Representatives permitted cameras in its chamber to cover floor debates. Then-Rep. Al Gore (D-Tenn.) ushered in the C-SPAN era in a minute-long speech.</p>\n<p>“The solution for the lack of confidence in government, Mr. Speaker, is more open government at all levels,” the future vice president said before urging the Senate to follow the House’s lead on camera coverage.</p>\n<p>C-SPAN began airing call-in programs in 1980 and began 24-hour broadcasting two years later. It launched C-SPAN2 in 1986, when the U.S. Senate approved televising its debates.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJennie Kamin\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Peggy Ackermann&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=7714952\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=7714952 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.guidestar.org/profile/84-0751854\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.guidestar.org/profile/84-0751854 </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/about/faq/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.c-span.org/about/faq/ </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/series/?1968\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.c-span.org/series/?1968 </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/about/mission/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.c-span.org/about/mission/ </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://cepr.net/documents/publications/1207_cspan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://cepr.net/documents/publications/1207_cspan.pdf </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/about/leadership/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.c-span.org/about/leadership/ </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/about/contactUs/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.c-span.org/about/contactUs/ </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/about/history/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.c-span.org/about/history/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://online.purdue.edu/comm/masters-in-communication/brian-lamb\" target=\"_blank\">https://online.purdue.edu/comm/masters-in-communication/brian-lamb </a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"c-span.org","author":"Jennie Kamin","date":"2018-08-27T16:27:47.053+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/c-span.org/"}}
