WGN-TV also publishes special sections, including “Chicago’s Very Own,” featuring content about local citizens. Most coverage is local, with national and international stories from wire services including the Tribune Media Wire and The Associated Press. Some stories on the site also include video clips of broadcasts that appeared on the television network.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>WGN-TV’s staff is comprised of more than 50 reporters and anchors. Original stories feature firsthand reporting and cite primary documents, experts, and other credible news outlets. Headlines accurately reflect the content of stories, and articles are generally balanced and fact-based. The site publishes updates to stories explaining errors, and articles link to a form where readers can suggest corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site provides contact information for the general newsroom and includes a roster of reporters, with their biographies. There is no contact information or mention of the station’s general manager, though there is a page outlining the station’s history and ownership. Although most stories name reporters, some are only attributed to WGN Web Desk or to the wire service that originally produced them. Advertisements and sponsored content are distinguishable from news content. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>WGN-TV was founded in 1948 by Colonel Robert McCormick, the publisher of the Chicago Tribune for several decades in the first half of the 20th century. The call letters originally stood for “World’s Greatest Newspaper.” In 1978, WGN-TV began broadcasting across the country as one of the country’s first “superstations,” along with TBS. The former superstation, today known as WGN America, now broadcasts national content via cable, satellite, and online in many markets around. </p>\n<p><em>Disclosure: James Warren, executive editor of NewsGuard, is a regular, unpaid contributor to </em><em>WGN-TV. </em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBen Strauss\n\nEdited by:\nSarah Brandt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-sinclair-sale-wgn-tv-tribune-20180226-story.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-sinclair-sale-wgn-tv-tribune-20180226-story.htm</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tribunemedia.com/about-tribune-media/l\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tribunemedia.com/about-tribune-media/l</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wgntv.com/2018/06/13/hackers-targeting-home-buyers-scamming-people-of-out-thousands/\" target=\"_blank\">http://wgntv.com/2018/06/13/hackers-targeting-home-buyers-scamming-people-of-out-thousands/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wgntv.com/2018/06/18/who-classifies-gaming-disorder-as-mental-health-condition/\" target=\"_blank\">http://wgntv.com/2018/06/18/who-classifies-gaming-disorder-as-mental-health-condition/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://wgntv.com/2018/07/09/trump-enjoys-suspense-ahead-of-supreme-court-announcement/\" target=\"_blank\">https://wgntv.com/2018/07/09/trump-enjoys-suspense-ahead-of-supreme-court-announcement/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wgntv.com/author/dina-bair/\" target=\"_blank\">https://wgntv.com/author/dina-bair/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://prod.headlineclub.org/2017/05/12/and-the-peter-lisagor-award-winners-are/\" target=\"_blank\">http://prod.headlineclub.org/2017/05/12/and-the-peter-lisagor-award-winners-are/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/business/media/sinclair-broadcast-komo-conservative-media.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/business/media/sinclair-broadcast-komo-conservative-media.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2018/04/02/here-are-66-local-news-stations-airing-sinclair-s-brainwashing-anti-media-promo/219812\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2018/04/02/here-are-66-local-news-stations-airing-sinclair-s-brainwashing-anti-media-promo/219812</a></li>\n<li>\n<p>Examples of corrections <a href=\"https://wgntv.com/2018/06/10/andersonville-porch-collapses-during-house-party-sending-3-to-hospitals/&nbsp;https://wgntv.com/2018/07/09/grandfather-beaten-with-concrete-block-told-to-go-back-to-your-own-country/\" target=\"_blank\">https://wgntv.com/2018/06/10/andersonville-porch-collapses-during-house-party-sending-3-to-hospitals/ https://wgntv.com/2018/07/09/grandfather-beaten-with-concrete-block-told-to-go-back-to-your-own-country/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wgntv.com/contact/people/\" target=\"_blank\">https://wgntv.com/contact/people/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://wgntv.com/2018/09/28/google-ceo-to-meet-with-us-lawmakers-after-previous-snub/\" target=\"_blank\">https://wgntv.com/2018/09/28/google-ceo-to-meet-with-us-lawmakers-after-previous-snub/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115224993.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115224993.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wgntv.com/station-history/\" target=\"_blank\">https://wgntv.com/station-history/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-robertmccormick-story-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-robertmccormick-story-story.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tribunemedia.com/our-brands/wgn-america/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tribunemedia.com/our-brands/wgn-america/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"wgntv.com","author":"Ben Strauss","date":"2018-10-02T21:22:09.875+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/wgntv.com/"}}
