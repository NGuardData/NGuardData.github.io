All three remain involved with the site, according to its About page, which identifies Lifson as founder, editor, and publisher, but does not state who owns the site.</p>\n<p>The site runs advertising and offers readers an option to pay a monthly subscription fee to avoid the ads. The site also solicits donations, while noting that it is not a nonprofit, so it can “reserve the right to be partisan.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Americanthinker.com’s About page states that “There is no limit to the topics appearing on American Thinker. National security in all its dimensions -- strategic, economic, diplomatic, and military -- is emphasized. The right to exist and the survival of the State of Israel are of great importance to us.” </p>\n<p>The site publishes articles criticizing Democrats, liberalism, feminism, Islam, and homosexuality. (A September 2018 article was headlined “Christians Who Oppose Conversion Therapy Need a Reality Check.”) It publishes approximately a dozen opinion and commentary articles a day, separating content into “blogs” and “articles.” Although the two categories appear similar, the site’s Contact page says blogs offer a quick analysis of “breaking news” while articles contain “analysis and new information.” </p>\n<p>Articles published on the site have described President Donald Trump as a “culture leader changing the world,” argued that he is “winning over blacks, Hispanics, millennials, and even gays,” and described climate-change concerns as “hysteria.” In September 2018, it published an article headlined “The Myth of the Moderate Muslim.” Another article argued that Pope Francis is “normalizing homosexual behavior.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Americanthinker.com gained a wide conservative readership in 2008, thanks to its strong criticism of then-presidential candidate Barack Obama, The New York Times reported. Critics say the site boosted the “birther” conspiracy claiming that President Obama was not born in the United States, pointing, for example, to a 2011 article that referred to Obama’s “$100 souvenir version” Hawaii birth certificate.</p>\n<p>In response to NewsGuard’s question about its apparent support for the discredited notion that Obama was not born in the U.S., the site’s editor, Thomas Lifson, told NewsGuard in an email, “The sustained refusal to release Obama’s long form birth certificate is reason to be suspicious. We have examined the evidence. That is reasonable to do when a candidate or office holder withholds documentary evidence.”</p>\n<p>NewsGuard found numerous recent examples of false claims on the site. For example, in August 2018, the site suggested that former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton “allowed” the Chinese government to access classified national security information on her email server. The article states that “Given the Clintons' pattern of behavior, one must assume they were being paid for giving the Chinese access.” No evidence has emerged to back this claim.</p>\n<p>The same article states that government rules for server use “don't apply to the Clintons. Former FBI director James Comey admitted as much in his famous July 2016 press conference when he explained in detail how Mrs. Clinton negligently and illegally handled national security materials but that she would be given a pass based on her last name and her presidential candidacy.” Comey never said he would give Clinton “a pass” because of her name and candidacy.</p>\n<p>Asked about the Clinton server claim, Lifson stated, “It is perfectly reasonable to consider possible explanations given her familiarity with State Department regulations forbidding a private server.” Asked about the claim regarding Comey’s press conference, Lifson stated, “This was satirical sarcasm, quite justified because Comey’s explanation made no sense at all.”</p>\n<p>The main section of Americanthinker.com’s About page does not explicitly disclose its conservative perspective, stating that it operates “out of concern for the complex and morally significant questions on the national agenda.” In a fundraising appeal at the bottom of the About page, the site states that it intends to be “a strong conservative voice.” But this language does not appear in the general site description or in another easily accessible part of the site. </p>\n<p>Because Americanthinker.com does not clearly disclose its orientation and yet infuses its perspective in its content -- sometimes twisting facts to make its case -- NewsGuard has determined that the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>In February 2015, Americanthinker.com said that President Obama made a Muslim “gang sign” to African leaders. It based this claim on a photo of Obama and a group of African leaders at a 2014 conference, which appears to show Obama wagging his finger. But Americanthinker.com said the Obama made a gesture that was “symbolic of the one-God concept of Muhammad and is understood by all believers to be a symbolic shahada, the Muslim affirmation of faith.” </p>\n<p>Fact-checking site Snopes noted that there is no evidence that Obama was making an Islamic gesture, and a review by NewsGuard also found no backing for this claim. Moreover, the “shahada” is a routine, verbalized declaration of the Islamic faith. It is not a “gang sign.”</p>\n<p>In response to NewsGuard’s inquiry about the “gang sign” article, Lifson told NewsGuard: “Snopes interprets the hand sign differently than this article did. This is nothing but their opinion. Snopes has its own biases.” </p>\n<p>PolitiFact, another fact-checking site, rated as “false” a March 2015 AmericanThinker.com article that reported that as part of Michelle Obama's Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, “the US government is proposing to weigh and measure all children in public and private daycare facilities.” PolitiFact noted that under the program, only several thousand children would be weighed, “a tiny fraction of the more than 30 million children in some form of day care.” The statement that “all” children in U.S. public and private daycare facilities were to be weighed is false. </p>\n<p>Asked about this article, Lifson said that American Thinker’s post cited the Washington Free Beacon as it source. However, The Beacon article does not state that all children will be weighed, noting instead that “the USDA [US Department of Agriculture] will also check the weight and height of roughly 3,000 children.”</p>\n<p>The site’s Contact page features guidelines for article submissions. The guidelines require that writers “source, verify, and then double-check all facts in their submissions,” noting that “Wikipedia, something you heard on the radio, and nearly all bloggers are not definitive sources.” The guidelines instruct writers not to “write speculatively about factual information” and to provide links to their sources.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, many articles on the site do not link to sources. Articles often misstate and distort facts, without providing sources for “important factual contentions,” as the guidelines require. Therefore, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not gather and present news responsibly.</p>\n<p>The site does not have a corrections policy, but regularly posts corrections on articles.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles name the writer and sometimes include biographical or contact information, but many only link to an archive of the writer’s previous work. Because of that inconsistency, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not meet the standard for providing information on content creators. In response to NewsGuard’s inquiry about content creators, Lifson wrote in an email, “Some authors prefer to keep their identifying characteristics private. Ad [sic] you may have heard or read, conservatives are unpopular or persecuted in many circumstances in this country. We are happy to identify those writers who are willing to share.”</p>\n<p>Americanthinker.com provides a full list of its management, along with detailed biographies, but does not identify owners. In an email to NewsGuard, Lifson confirmed that he owns American Thinker, but did not comment on why that is not disclosed on the site.</p>\n<p>Although many of the advertisements that appear on AmericanThinker.com are distinguishable from editorial content, the site features content that appears under the banner “Recommended,” which is labeled “Powered by Feed Network.”</p>\n<p>Asked about these ads, Lifson wrote, “American Thinker has [a] strict policy of not selling our editorial space,” and said that the Feed Network label “clearly means ‘Not American Thinker editorial content.’” He continued: “To my eyes, those are obviously ads, as they are different in appearance than our editorial content.” However, because these advertisements appear in the format of news headlines and are not labeled as paid content, they do not meet NewsGuard’s standard for clearly labeling advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Americanthinker.com was founded in 2003.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note:
