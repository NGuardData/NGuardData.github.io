Nearly every text story is linked to internally produced video.</p>\n<p>The site also links to text and video from the USA Today Network. Sponsored content by advertisers appears online in similar formats to news stories, and is labeled. The site limits online access to a limited number of articles per month for free before charging a subscription fee.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Headlines describe stories accurately, and articles are balanced and well-sourced, often from first-hand reporting.</p>\n<p>The site refers to the USA Today ethical principles for newsrooms, which indicates it will publish corrections promptly and that it strives to be fair and balanced in its coverage.</p>\n<p>El Paso Times staff members were part of the USA Today Network team that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2017 for explanatory reporting on the feasibility and impact of a wall dividing the U.S.-Mexican border. The El Paso Times’ editor and news director, Zahira Torres, was part of the team at the Los Angeles Times that won a 2016 Pulitzer Prize in breaking news for coverage of the San Bernardino shootings.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site is described as being part of the USA Today Network. The site lists phone numbers, titles, and email addresses for staff and general customer service.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are either labeled or easily recognizable as graphically distinct from news; most ads appear under a banner with the specific title of “Ad Content.” News and opinion have clearly labeled tabs, and each opinion article is identified as such.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The El Paso Times newspaper was founded in 1881. The site registered its domain in 1998.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nLarry Levin\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://texaspress.com/award-winning-investigative-journalist-leads-el-paso-times\" target=\"_blank\">http://texaspress.com/award-winning-investigative-journalist-leads-el-paso-times</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gannett.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.gannett.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/berlinschoolofcreativeleadership/2017/02/01/10-journalism-brands-where-you-will-find-real-facts-rather-than-alternative-facts/2/#284d201c6014&nbsp;(USA\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/berlinschoolofcreativeleadership/2017/02/01/10-journalism-brands-where-you-will-find-real-facts-rather-than-alternative-facts/2/#284d201c6014 (USA</a> Today as “runner up”)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/2017/10/20/zahira-torres-becomes-second-woman-first-latina-lead-times/785201001/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/2017/10/20/zahira-torres-becomes-second-woman-first-latina-lead-times/785201001/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/texas/articles/2017-09-20/el-paso-times-editor-resigns-in-effort-to-save-newsroom-jobs\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/texas/articles/2017-09-20/el-paso-times-editor-resigns-in-effort-to-save-newsroom-jobs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mediamoves.com/tag/zahira-torres\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mediamoves.com/tag/zahira-torres</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nationalpress.org/award-winner/robert-moore/\" target=\"_blank\">https://nationalpress.org/award-winner/robert-moore/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://static.elpasotimes.com/aboutus/\" target=\"_blank\">http://static.elpasotimes.com/aboutus/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://static.elpasotimes.com/contactus/\" target=\"_blank\">http://static.elpasotimes.com/contactus/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elpasotimes.com/contact/staff/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.elpasotimes.com/contact/staff/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"elpasotimes.com","author":"Larry Levin","date":"2018-07-24T15:53:20.102+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/elpasotimes.com/"}}
