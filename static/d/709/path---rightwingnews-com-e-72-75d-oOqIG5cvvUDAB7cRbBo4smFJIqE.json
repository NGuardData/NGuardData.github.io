John Hawkins, a columnist for the conservative news sites Townhall and PJ Media, created rightwingnews.com in 2001. In a January 2018 Townhall column, Hawkins wrote that the site garnered a large Facebook audience during the 2016 presidential election, but that Facebook “just started methodically cutting [the site’s exposure] down after the election” through algorithm changes. Hawkins is not involved in the day-to-day operations of rwnofficial.com.</p>\n<p>The site’s About Us page says it is owned and operated by MediaVines, Inc. Jeff Rainforth, the site’s chief editor, told NewsGuard in an email that MediaVines “is a newer company comprised of American conservative bloggers who united to establish a conservative based news/opinion following.” </p>\n<p>The site runs advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>RWN stands for Right Wing News. The site says it “publishes content that is traditional news, opinion based and is consistent with conservative values.” Coverage is separated into categories including video, news, politics, culture, and opinion. Right Wing News’ coverage of political and cultural news exhibits a strong conservative slant, negatively portraying liberals and Democratic politicians and praising conservatives and the Trump administration. The site’s perspective is evident in headlines such as “Cop Pulls Man Over for Best Anti-Obama Sticker He’s Ever Seen — It’s Priceless” and “Melania Steps Out Of Presidential Limo At English Palace, Instantly Becomes A Queen.” </p>\n<p>Stories typically include photos and tweets, and often link to original sources, which range from large news organizations such as Fox News and HuffPost to websites such as mrctv.org and hannity.com.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Since the site’s inception in March 2018, Right Wing News has published multiple misleading or false stories. After NewsGuard spoke with chief editor Jeff Rainforth, the site issued corrections on the articles NewsGuard flagged as false or misleading. Because none of these stories were corrected promptly after their original publication, NewsGuard has decided that Right Wing News does not currently meet its standard for not repeatedly publishing false content.</p>\n<p>In June 2018, the site ran a story headlined “Head Of Democratic Party Just Hauled Out In Handcuffs With Multiple Charges – Enjoy Life Behind Bars!” The official referenced is former Alabama Secretary of State Nancy Worley, but the site’s Facebook page shared the article with an image of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, according to fact-checking site Factcheck.org. Worley was in fact indicted in March 2007, for charges related to her re-election campaign, but the story left out the detail that nine out of ten charges that had been filed against her were dropped. Also, there was no basis for the headline’s suggestion that she could face life in prison. In July 2018, the site updated the story, changing the headline to “FLASHBACK! Head Of Alabama Democratic Party Faced Multiple Felonies &#x26; Misdemeanors,” editing the body of the story to remove inaccuracies, and adding an editor’s note to explain the update.</p>\n<p>Another story published in June 2018 was headlined, “412 Michigan Muslims Arrested In Fed’s ‘LARGEST BUST IN U.S. HISTORY’ After Uncovering Deadly Hidden Secret.” The story misrepresented a July 2017 healthcare-fraud bust by the U.S. Justice Department. According to the department, only 32 of the people arrested were in Michigan, and there is nothing in court records that indicates the religion of the defendants. One Michigan defendant, Mashiyat Rashid, was identified as Muslim in a story in The Detroit News. The story was removed from the site, and Rainforth told NewsGuard that “we decided it was best to remove the article after the source the writer chose was from a fake news site.” He added that the site “had to let go of a former editor for missing multiple catastrophic errors that caused our domain to be flagged on articles for errors” and that “[b]ecause of the lapse in issues we had with editing, you will see that we added a team member whose duty is to fact check everything published.”</p>\n<p>Right Wing News later republished a corrected version of the story, headlined “412 Arrested, Muslim Ring Leader Caught In LARGEST BUST IN HISTORY,” which includes an editor’s note explaining that the earlier version of the headline “implied all defendants were Muslim, and that claim is unsupported. We clarified it was just the ring leader Mashiyat Rashid.”</p>\n<p>A June 2018 story, “Money-Grubbing Michelle ‘Worried About Netflix Deal’ Made Sure ABC Stuck Dagger In Roseanne’s Back,” was based on unproven speculation. The only source of the rumor was a tweet by an individual not affiliated with ABC who claimed to have insider information proving that Michelle Obama was behind the network’s decision to cancel comedian Roseanne Barr’s TV show.  After NewsGuard spoke with Right Wing News about the story, the site changed the headline to “Money-Grubbing Michelle ‘Worried About Netflix Deal’ Made Sure ABC Stuck Dagger In Roseanne’s Back According To Twitter Follower” and added an editor’s note to explain the change, which reads in part: “Our headline was causing confusion about the facts on the story….In order to ensure readers realize the claim was just a mere statement and not a fact, we added ‘According To Twitter Follower’ at the end of the headline.”</p>\n<p>The site’s news stories regularly contain authors’ opinions, such as an August 2018 article headlined “Omarosa’s Best Friend Turns On Her, Goes Public With Info That Should Shut Her Up Once And For All.” The story concerned allegations of racism against President Donald Trump raised by Omarosa Manigault Newman, a former White House aide, and said that “Trump has a great history with people of other races and not once in all his years of stardom has he ever been accused of something racist. It’s just not there.” In fact, President Trump has a long history of comments and actions that many critics over the years have claimed were racist.</p>\n<p>Because Right Wing News’ coverage frequently distorts facts to advance writers’ opinions, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>When asked about factually inaccurate stories, Rainforth directed NewsGuard to the site’s Standards &#x26; Ethics page, added by July 2018, which details Right Wing News’ approach to sourcing, corrections, updates, and other aspects of reporting. The site says that “minor corrections will be noted at the bottom of the article and major factual corrections will be noted at the top, unless entire sections are changed then it will be noted at the bottom. We should strive for clarity and transparency.” Nearly all of the language of this page was pulled verbatim from BuzzFeed News’ Standards And Ethics guide.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site is clear about its ownership by MediaVines, Inc., but does not include any information about the company. Its Our Team page lists the site’s staff, but does not provide biographical information or contact details. Stories are not usually attributed to these team members. Some authors are pseudonymous or do not provide their full names, such as “The Conservative Jew” or “Rory.”</p>\n<p>Rainforth, the chief editor, said in an email to NewsGuard that most content creators are required to reveal their names. The site does not require writers to include profiles, he said, because of the tenor of the times. “There’s a lot of negativity attached to writing political articles lately and some writers want nothing but their names listed,” Rainforth said. “Some are teachers, some hold professional level jobs and want to keep things more private.\"</p>\n<p>The site clearly labels advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Rwnofficial.com was registered in March 2018. The site’s About Us page says that Right Wing News merged with MediaVines, Inc. that same year.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this label stated that Hawkins started rightwingnews.com in 2009, according to information that was provided on the site’s About Us page. In fact, the site launched in 2001.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nNina Zweig\n\nEdited by:\nJim Warren&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership
