Mansueto bought Fast Company (and Inc. magazine) in 2005 from Gruner + Jahr USA Publishing, a division of Bertelsmann, for an estimated $35 million. Fast Company earns revenue through subscriptions to the print publication, advertisements, and sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The magazine says it “inspires readers to think beyond traditional boundaries, lead conversations, and create the future of business.” FastCompany.com publishes news analysis, feature articles, interviews, company profiles, career advice, and videos covering technology, leadership, entertainment, ideas, and design. Articles are written by staff writers and freelancers, as well as business leaders. The site reprints articles originally published on websites such as Glassdoor and The Muse. Content is accompanied by an estimate of how long it will take to read.</p>\n<p>Fast Company publishes interviews with business leaders, such as Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Spotify CEO Daniel Elk. It features executives’ first-person advice and reflections. For example, it published “How I’ve used these 4 ‘flaws’ to my advantage as an introverted leader” and “Hi, we failed to sell you America.”</p>\n<p>Co.Design, which was a separate site run by Fast Company until 2018, is now a section within FastCompany.com and explores the intersection of business and design. Similarly, two additional sites, Co.Create and Co.Exist, became the FastCompany.com Entertainment and Ideas sections, respectively, in 2017. A technology section that experimented with new editorial approaches was phased out in 2015.</p>\n<p>Fast Company publishes annual lists honoring individual and corporate innovators, as well as winners of its World Changing Ideas and Innovation by Design awards.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Stories on FastCompany.com are well-sourced and have an often lively and accessible tone. For example, 2018 headlines included, “This must be how brands like Allbirds and Shake Shack get their kicks” and “What do women want in swimwear? Different levels of butt coverage.” They often link to primary documents such as journal articles. Co.Design has a more opinionated, blog-like voice, with headlines such as “Ikea Just Totally Ditched The Ikea Look” and “Arby’s new font is just as gross as you’d imagine.”</p>\n<p>News analysis, opinion, and first-person narratives written by business executives are often presented adjacent to one another without separately identifying them. For example, an August 2018 piece arguing that New York City Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had the right to spurn a debate offer from conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro was not marked as opinion. An August 2018 story written by a woman who started a digital service to assist women with fertility treatments was not identified as a first-person narrative. Because Fast Company publishes news analysis, first-person content, and opinion in the same sections without labeling them accordingly, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>Paul Smalera, FastCompany.com executive editor, told NewsGuard that Fast Company does not strive to produce straight news coverage with a “just the facts approach.” He said writers instead seek to provide additional context that is rooted in facts. “A Fast Company reader is someone who is pretty worldly and informed about the world already,” he said. “When we write about the news we’re asking our writers to provide analysis and insight.”</p>\n<p>Fast Company was named Magazine of the Year, for its print and digital publications, by the American Society of Magazine Editors in 2014. The Co.Design site was awarded a National Magazine Award by the same organization, in the Online Department category, in 2011. FastCompany.com won Webby Awards in the visual design and business blog categories in 2016 and 2007, respectively.</p>\n<p>The site regularly updates articles and notes corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles on FastCompany.com name the author and link to an archive of the writer’s work. Biographical information is provided for most content creators and some writers also include links to their social media profiles. Email addresses for individual writers and editors are not provided. The site lists Fast Company staff, which includes executives at Mansueto Ventures, editors, and writers. It is linked to from the FastCompany.com Contact Us page. This page also lists a general editorial email and the magazine’s physical address.</p>\n<p>Fast Company discloses its relationship with Mansueto Ventures. Advertisements and sponsored content are clearly marked.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Fast Company was founded in 1995 by former Harvard Business Review editors Alan Webber and Bill Taylor. It became a monthly publication in 1998. Real estate billionaire and media entrepreneur Mort Zuckerman was the magazine’s majority owner at the time of its launch, with a reported $10 million investment. He sold Fast Company to Gruner &#x26; Jahr for $360 million in 2000.</p>\n<p>Zuckerman has owned U.S. News &#x26; World Report since 1984. He also owned The Atlantic and The New York Daily News before selling them to David G. Bradley and Tronc, respectively, in 1999 and 2017. The FastCompany.com domain name was created in 1995. Mansueto Ventures formed Mansueto Digital in 2007, investing $10 million in the digital expansion.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nMelissa Goldin\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Jim
