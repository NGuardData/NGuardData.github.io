{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<div class=\"right-score\">Score: 0</div>\n<h1>prnewswire.com&emsp; <span class=\"net-country\">(WEB - en-US)</span></h1>\n<p>The website of PR Newswire, a platform and service that publishes press releases and other promotional content from companies, government agencies, and other organizations.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<p>PR Newswire is owned by Cision Ltd., a publicly traded company headquartered in Chicago, through its PR Newswire Association LLC subsidiary. The company, which has offices on six continents, also owns a collection of database, monitoring, and analytics services aimed at marketing and communications professionals.</p>\n<p>According to its 2017 annual report, Cision recorded $647 million in revenue in 2017. The report states that revenue came largely from subscriptions to its press-release distribution services, including PR Newswire.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>PR Newswire publishes and ensures timely and effective distribution of press releases and other promotional content produced by third-party organizations in five main categories — Business &#x26; Money, Science &#x26; Tech, Lifestyle &#x26; Health, Policy &#x26; Public Interest, and People &#x26; Culture. These organizations include international corporations (such as The Walt Disney Company, PepsiCo, and Scholastic); lesser-known startups (SiLC Technologies, Vydeo, EarnUp); nonprofits (American Cancer Society, Bloomberg Philanthropies, American Red Cross); and government entities (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Canadian government, the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism).</p>\n<p>In addition to content produced by third-party organizations, PR Newswire publishes its own content aimed at helping organizations improve their marketing strategies, such as “10 Ways to Promote Your Event” and “Make Killer Content: Write Like a Journalist in 15 Ways.”</p>\n<p>PR Newswire also provides services such as analytics and video development, and offers resources geared toward journalists, including a database of expert sources and a photo archive.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Organizations must be a member of PR Newswire to post content on the site. In order to become a member, an organization pays a membership fee, and its bona fides are confirmed by PR Newswire, according to a PR Newswire business development representative with whom NewsGuard spoke. Membership starts at $195 per year and companies are also charged for each press release they post, the representative said.</p>\n<p>Readers can access content posted by PR Newswire member organizations, such as press releases, without registering for the site. However, basic personal information must be provided to read the content produced by PR Newswire.</p>\n<p>A 2014 post on the site outlined guidelines for “press releases and other content submitted for distribution via PR Newswire’s wire distribution network.” It stated that before publication, PR Newswire’s staff will verify sources, confirm the sender’s identity, and assess the quality of the content. The note also stated that “PR Newswire has taken steps recently to identify and remove low quality content from its website.”</p>\n<p>At the same time, PR Newswire states on its Terms of Use page that it “does not guarantee the accuracy, timeliness, integrity, quality, safety, appropriateness or any other aspect of any information or content provided by PR Newswire. Posted information and data may not be complete, timely or accurate, and should not be relied upon. We will, however, use reasonable efforts to correct any error of fact, timing or omission brought to our attention.”</p>\n<p>PR Newswire has published false press releases on a number of occasions. In 2010, for example, the sited posted a release that appeared to be from General Mills, claiming that the Obama administration was investigating the company’s supply chain, according to reports in multiple media outlets including  Reuters and The Wall Street Journal. A General Mills spokeswoman told The Wall Street Journal that the release was “‘completely false.”  PR Newswire issued a retraction, although the company declined to comment about how the fake press release got published.</p>\n<p>PR Newswire publishes corrections to press releases, typically with a note above or below the content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Posts written by PR Newswire do not name an author. Press releases name the organization that provided the release and link to an archive of the organization’s content. Some also list a media representative, including contact information and a description of the organization.</p>\n<p>Biographical information for Cision management can be found on the site’s Leadership Team page, but it does not specify who is in charge of its content.</p>\n<p>PR Newswire’s ownership by Cision is disclosed via a Cision logo that appears at the top of each page. A link at the bottom of each page directs users to Cision’s website.</p>\n<p>PRNewswire.com does not run advertising.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard sent two emails to PR Newswire’s media contact address inquiring about the company’s editorial processes, as well as one to Laura Roman, director of corporate communications at Cision, but none of the messages elicited a response. A PR Newswire representative reached through a member support phone number directed NewsGuard to send questions to a generic help desk email. This message also did not receive a response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>PR Newswire was founded in 1954 by Herbert Muschel. It originally distributed press releases using news organizations’ Western Union teleprinter equipment. Trans World Airlines was its first customer. Muschel also developed a television programs guide in the late 1940s and served as a radio operator in the merchant marine during World War II.</p>\n<p>The PRNewswire.com domain name was created in 1995. Cision bought PR Newswire from London-based UBM PLC in an $841 million deal that was completed in 2016.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSam Howard\n\nEdited by:\nMelissa Goldin&#x26;emsp;Eric
