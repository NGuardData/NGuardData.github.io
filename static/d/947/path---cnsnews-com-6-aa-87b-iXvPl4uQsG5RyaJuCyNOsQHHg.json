Brent Bozell III, a nephew of the late conservative commentator William F. Buckley Jr., who founded National Review. The site’s editor in chief, Terence Jeffrey, headed conservative Patrick Buchanan’s 1996 presidential campaign. </p>\n<p>The Media Research Center’s revenue comes from contributions, gifts, and advertising. Rebekah Mercer, a Republican megadonor whose family is also a part owner of the right-leaning Breitbart News, is listed as a MRC director on the organization’s 2016 Form 990 nonprofit filing with the IRS as well as in its 2017 Annual Report.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>CNSNews.com’s motto, in a banner on its home page, is “The Right News. Right Now.” Its About Us page says it aims to “cover stories that are subject to the bias of omission and report on other news subject to bias by commission.”</p>\n<p>Staff-written stories are presented in sections focused on Washington, national news, and international news. These articles are generally straightforward and fact-based, with headlines often based on direct quotes (“Hoyer: Trump ‘Seeks to Establish a More Authoritarian Regime’”) or on research (“Poll: 25% Want Smoking Made Totally Illegal in USA.”) Stories are typically structured around quotes from interviews, television programs, and press conferences.</p>\n<p>The site also posts commentary from contributors including Buchanan, Bozell, commentator Ben Shapiro, and Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. Columns in 2018 promoted conservative views of gun control, abortion, immigration, and labor unions.</p>\n<p>The site has links to the Media Research Center’s other sites, including MRCTV.org and Newsbusters.org, whose motto is “exposing and combating liberal media bias.” The CNS News Video page publishes content from MRCTV.org, the Media Research Center’s multimedia producer. These videos include original interviews in addition to republished videos of conservative figures in press conferences or television interviews. The site’s cartoons section consists of reprinted panels by the late Glenn Foden, described by the Baltimore Sun in its 2016 obituary as a “happy warrior” for conservative advocacy groups. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>CNS News stories generally contain accurate facts and straightforward headlines, selected and written from a perspective that favors Republicans and conservatives. For example, a July 2018 lead story on President Trump and economic growth figures was headlined, “As Trump anticipated, 2nd Quarter GDP Growth Was a ‘Terrific’ 4.1%.” Another story quoted a report from the conservative Americans for Tax Reform that said that several companies were increasing benefits to employees as a result of the tax plan.  </p>\n<p>CNSNews.com has published several stories cited by fact-checking sites, including Snopes and Politifact, as false or misleading. NewsGuard has reviewed the fact-checking sites’ claims and agrees with their findings.  </p>\n<p>In one of the stories cited by fact-checking organizations, a February 2018 CNSNews post reported that a pastor had been informed by an unnamed source that First Lady Melania Trump had demanded an exorcism of the White House before she would move in. The article was not updated when the first lady’s spokeswoman dismissed these claims as \"not true in any way.”</p>\n<p>In a series of 2015 articles, CNS News accused Planned Parenthood of harvesting and selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit. It was revealed that the undercover videos that prompted this claim was deceptively edited. (Planned Parenthood representatives were discussing the donation of extracted tissue for medical research, for which transportation costs can be reimbursed, not the for-profit sale of fetuses.) The CNS News articles have not been taken down or corrected.</p>\n<p>A 2015 column by Terence Jeffrey, the site’s editor in chief, was cited by Politifact for reporting that there were nearly 4 million more Americans receiving funding from “means-tested federal programs -- n.b. welfare” than full-time workers. Jeffrey quoted Census Bureau statistics from 2012 and 2013. However, his count of Americans receiving such benefits included children and senior citizens who were not eligible to work and omitted the fact that many people receiving benefits are also working full-time.</p>\n<p>Although the site publishes updates, there is no apparent process for running corrections or clarifications, and NewsGuard was unable to readily find any recently corrected stories. </p>\n<p>CNS News and Jeffrey did not respond to an email, contact form, and voicemail seeking comment about the site’s handling of opinion, factual distortion in some news stories and headlines, and its approach to corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site’s About Us page lists a mailing address, e-mail address, and telephone information, although NewsGuard’s attempts to contact the editors from that page drew no response. Readers can leave comments at the bottom of news and opinion stories. News stories generally provide authors’ names and links to biographies for CNS News staff. Commentaries provide a short description of contributors at the bottom of the text. Some articles are attributed to “CNSNews.com Staff,” rather than to an individual writer. The site identifies its leadership on a Staff page.</p>\n<p>Sponsored content is not always labeled. A “We Recommend” feature is labeled “promoted links,” but the feature mixes CNS articles with sponsored content that is not clearly labeled as such.  </p>\n<p>CNS and Jeffrey did not respond to an email, contact form inquiry and voicemail asking about CNS’ labeling of advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>CNSNews.com was launched on June 16, 1998, by Bozell, chairman of the Media Research Center. Bozell was an outspoken critic of candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 election season, calling him, in National Review, “the greatest charlatan of them all,” and, on Fox News, a “huckster.” Bozell is now a Trump defender. </p>\n<p><em>Corrections: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label gave the wrong URL for a CNS affiliate; the correct web address is MRCTV.org. Also, a comment made by MRC President L. Brent Bozell III was wrongly cited to Politico when if fact the remark was made on Fox News.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nStu Rohrer\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric
