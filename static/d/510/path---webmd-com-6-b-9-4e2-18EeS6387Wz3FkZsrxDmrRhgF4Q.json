The site also hosts live web events and message boards, which are intended to be “a gathering spot for WebMD members,” according to the site. WebMd also runs content generated by sister sites including HealthDay and MedScape.</p>\n<p>Besides offering a deep selection of non-time-sensitive medical content, the site runs articles pegged to the news and to current trends. In September 2018, for example, as the southeastern United States was recovering from Hurricane Florence, WebMD’s front page featured an article headlined  “Staying Safe After a Hurricane.” Other newsy articles included “Why So Many Opioid Prescriptions?,” and “K2 and Spice: Dangerous Drugs with Dangerous Side Effects.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>WebMd’s editorial staff includes approximately a dozen senior editors, who according to the site work with four on-staff medical doctors, known as Medical Directors. Any content generated by a staff writer or a freelancer is reviewed by one of the four Medical Directors or by one of many freelance reviewer-doctors the Medical Directors oversee, the site says in the About Us section. </p>\n<p>According to the site’s explanation, articles also are reviewed by a staff editor. Published articles carry a notation at the bottom listing the name of the doctor who reviewed the article, a link to a biography of that reviewer, and the date of review.</p>\n<p>Opinion and news content are separated. For example, a section titled Conversations: Second Opinion, features content submitted by what the site describes as “credentialed freelancers,” such as registered dieticians or fitness bloggers. Posts in that section are appended with a disclaimer stating that any opinions expressed are those of the writer, “who may or may not have medical or scientific training.”</p>\n<p>Within the complex, multi-billion dollar healthcare industry, the practice of medical professionals accepting payments from companies to promote certain drugs or procedures has been controversial, and potential conflicts of interest can be a particular problem in medical-related journalism. NewsGuard checked WebMD’s four Medical Director’s for conflicts of interest in the database that tracks drug and device payments reported by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and found none. Similarly, NewsGuard also chose 10 WebMDs reviewer/doctors at random, put them through the same database, and found no identified conflicts.  </p>\n<p>Patricia Garrison, director of communications for WebMD, told NewsGuard in an email: “All experts undergo a background check that includes disclosure of conflict of interest. Any conflict of interest is disclosed in the expert's biography and published to WebMD.com…. Each expert's bio is linked to the content they reviewed.  We do not assign journalists to report on companies with whom they have disclosed a financial relationship.” </p>\n<p>WebMD has been accredited by the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission. URAC is a Washington-based nonprofit that issues accreditation to “healthcare entities” such as pharmacies, hospitals, and provider groups, after being evaluated \"to ensure that it is conducting business in a manner that meets predetermined criteria and is consistent with national standards,\" URAC states.</p>\n<p>Garrison noted that checks for conflicts of interest are “a requirement of and reviewed as part of our URAC Accreditation.”</p>\n<p>The site’s correction policy, which is spelled out in its About Us section, states that “if we identify errors that are material to the content, we will update the content and note those corrections on this page for sixty (60) days after the correction by linking to the corrected version of the original article and note the correction [on the ‘About Us’ page] for your reference.” Users who want to submit a correction can do so via the WebMD Support Center.</p>\n<p>Garrison provided NewsGuard with an example of a corrected story, but noted that corrections are rare. “This is largely due to our rigorous review process that each piece of content goes through before publishing,” said said. “That includes editorial review, sometimes by two editors, medical review by a board-certified physician and copy editing.”</p>\n<p>WebMd.com has received numerous awards from press organizations including the Society of Professional Journalists, Association of Health Care Journalists, American Society of Healthcare Publication Editors, Consumer Reports WebWatch, and The American Medical Writers Association. <br></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>WebMd.com provides biographies of its top managers, medical editors, and other editorial personnel on its Who We Are page. Stories typically include two links, one to the author’s biography, the other to the biography of the reviewing doctor. Individual email addresses are not provided.</p>\n<p>Advertising on the site is distinguished from editorial content. The site also devotes a page to explaining its approach to sponsored content. The policy states that content paid for by an advertiser is marked either \"From Our Sponsor,\" \"Sponsored by,\" \"Promoted by,\" or \"By (Sponsor's Name).\" In addition to these labels, sponsored content is accompanied by a brief description, such as “This content is from our sponsor. The sponsor has sole editorial control.”</p>\n<p>The site does not clearly disclose its ownership. Each web page contains a “WebMD LLC” copyright notice, which does not meet NewsGuard criteria for ownership disclosure, because it does not disclose its connection to its owner, investment firm KKR.</p>\n<p>When asked about a lack of clarity about ownership, a WebMD spokesperson told NG: “It's clear from our site that WebMD is owned by Internet Brands. If you go to Internet Brands' site, you can find there that Internet Brands is owned by KKR. Based on that, we feel that we have fully disclosed ownership.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Jeffrey Arnold, who founded WebMD soon after he graduated from college in 1998, was a “raw, rookie entrepreneur who had this way of making [venture capitalists] write million-dollar checks,” Fortune magazine wrote. In 2005, Arnold took the company public, and in 2017, WebMD was acquired by KKR for $2.8 billion.  </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nStephanie Gutmann\n\nEdited by:\nJohn Gregory&#x26;emsp;Eric
