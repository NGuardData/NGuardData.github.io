{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<div class=\"right-score\">Score: 0</div>\n<h1>duffelblog.com&emsp; <span class=\"net-country\">(WEB - en-US)</span></h1>\n<p>The website for Duffel Blog, a parody site publishing humorous, made-up stories about the U.S. military.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>DuffelBlog.com is owned by Duffel Media, a private company founded by Paul Szoldra, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who is also the site’s editor-in-chief. Duffel Blog receives revenue from advertising and solicits reader donations. </p>\n<p>Duffel Blog publishes satirical news stories about the U.S. military, with a tag that declares itself as  “The American Military’s Most-Trusted News Source.”  According to the site, only current or former U.S. military service members can be contributors. Duffel Blog’s writers often post stories under pseudonyms, such as “TurnTheMapAround,” “Bull Winkle” and “Roger Wilco.”</p>\n<p>Headlines on the site, written in a matter-of-fact style, include “Pentagon fails first audit and still gets promoted to Hexagon,” “Grim Reaper to dress as Secretary Mattis for Halloween;” and “Alarming study shows average officers indulge in merely five rosewater scones per day.”</p>\n<p>A November 2018 story, headlined “Smart bomb finally destroys something that costs more than a smart bomb,” recounts a fictional military commander's claim that the destruction of “five Taliban gun trucks” was the first time a precision-guided munition destroyed something of significant value. “We assess the value of these trucks that we destroyed as being about $200,000 a pop,” the satire article states. “A Hellfire missile only costs $115,000. This was the most efficient strike we’ve seen in this war yet.”</p>\n<p>Another November 2018 article described the fictitious decision to send troops to the Alamo in Texas for a “dramatic last stand against migrant caravan.” According to the article, “The administration conceded that the centuries-old mission walls wouldn’t provide the ideal defense against the procession of bad hombres, but that it would ‘just have to do’ until the great wall is erected,” the story states.</p>\n<p>A disclaimer in the About section says the website is a “parody of a news organization, and all content it publishes is satirical in nature” and that “no content should be regarded as truthful.” The website also warns users that its content is not suitable for minors.</p>\n<p>Duffel Blog stories have occasionally been mistaken for real news.</p>\n<p>A 2012 article that described how detainees at the U.S. military base and detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, would receive benefits from the post-9/11 GI BIll, prompted Senator Mitch McConnell’s office to contact the Pentagon about the issue, according to Wired magazine.</p>\n<p>The website Gizmodo was also fooled by Duffel Blog when it based a report on its site on a Duffel Blog story that said the Army was replacing the bayonets that are attached to some rifles with tomahawks. Gizmodo later acknowledged it was wrong to believe the 2012 story.</p>\n<p>Images are sometimes manipulated to match the content and are not credited.</p>\n<p>An About page provides ways to contact the website about advertising and offer feedback, but it does not offer the names of editorial managers or content creators.</p>\n<p>The website features a satirical About section claiming the publication was founded in 1797. According to the Columbia Journalism Review, the site actually began as part of CollegeVeteran.com, a website owned by Szoldra. In 2012, Szoldra moved the satirical content to Duffel Blog.  </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJoe Danielewicz\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric
