Subsidiaries also include Spanish-language Telemundo, theme parks, and television and movie production.</p>\n<p>The site generates revenue from advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>NBCNews.com is dominated by breaking news, entertainment, and sports stories provided by its staff or wire services. The site’s reporters, editors, video producers, and analytics specialists are part of a 200-person digital operation whose work appears primarily on NBCNews.com, MSNBC.com, and TODAY.com.</p>\n<p>The site produces a regular mix of original content daily. Correspondents and hosts of NBC News and MSNBC broadcasts, including Andrea Mitchell, Joy-Ann Reid, and Pete Williams, write articles for the site. Journalists throughout NBC file notes and stories into a shared content management system called News Connect. Their work frequently appears first on NBCnews.com.</p>\n<p>NBCNews.com is more centrist and diverse in story selection than MSNBC.com, which has a left-of-center orientation and focuses largely on politics and critical coverage of U.S. President Donald Trump. A NBCNews.com front page in January 2019 gave similar prominence to the latest developments in the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, the Brexit debate in the U.K., and a deep freeze that hit large portions of the northeastern U.S. </p>\n<p>NBCNews.com also curates sections of interest for Latino, LGBTQ, black and Asian-American communities. In 2018, it launched a clearly labeled opinion section called Think. NBCNews.com links to the pages of individual shows on NBC News, including the “Meet the Press” Sunday show, and magazine show “Dateline.” Original daily features include “First Read,” a morning briefing on political news produced by the “Meet the Press” staff and the network’s political unit.</p>\n<p>The website  is headed by experienced journalists, including executive editor Catherine Kim, a longtime producer for NBC, including the “Nightly News,” and managing editor David Firestone, a former New York Times reporter and editor, and managing editor of Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight sports-politics site. Their digital staff has its own White House reporter and politics editor, among other positions. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>NBC News has long been one of the premier broadcast news organizations, with extensive national and international coverage. Standout beat reporters include Mitchell, who is the chief foreign affairs correspondent and host of MSNBC’s daily “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” and Pete Williams, who covers the Justice Department and routinely breaks stories. The site produces original reports that are typically well-sourced and balanced, citing elected officials, political consultants, and a range of subject matter experts. Headlines accurately reflect content. Opinion pieces are separately labeled, and there is the separate Think section with opinion and commentary.</p>\n<p>NBCNews.com regularly publishes corrections, attaching notes to the end or top of text articles that explain the error and what was changed. NBCNews.com’s comprehensive corrections policy is not included on the site, although there is contact information available for those seeking a correction. The policy, which was made available to NewsGuard, states: “If a reader asks a reporter for a correction, the reporter must tell the story editor about the request. (Errors in politics stories should be discussed with the political editor.) Sometimes a discussion with editors will determine that a correction is unnecessary. In cases of substantive errors of fact, particularly ones that might involve legal issues, the correction should be discussed with NBC’s Standards and Legal departments. Once a correctable error is discovered, the editor of the story should confirm that an error was made and write a correction, which goes at the bottom of the story.”</p>\n<p>NBC News has confronted editorial controversies. Brian Williams, then-anchor of “Nightly News,” was suspended for six months without pay due to exaggerating his role in a helicopter incident in Iraq. Upon return, he moved to a host position on MSNBC.</p>\n<p>The network was in possession of a tape of Donald Trump’s lewd comments during a 2005 taping of “Access Hollywood” — which is owned and distributed by NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News and MSNBC. But The Washington Post broke the story about the tape a month before Trump was elected U.S. president in November 2016. In 2017, NBC was criticized for not running a story by Ronan Farrow, then a contributing correspondent for NBC News, on sexual misconduct by movie executive Harvey Weinstein. The New Yorker ran an 8,000-word piece by Farrow, who went on to share the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service with The New York Times for work that launched further revelations of sexual harassment and assault, particularly in the media and entertainment industries. </p>\n<p>In 2017, the company dismissed “Today” co-host Matt Lauer, a fixture at the morning show for more than two decades, amid allegations of sexual misconduct involving several female employees.</p>\n<p>NBC News President Noah Oppenheim told NBC staff after The New Yorker piece ran that the network had fully supported Farrow. “The notion that we would try to cover for a powerful person is deeply offensive to all of us. … We reached a point over the summer where we, as an organization, didn’t feel that we had all the elements that we needed to air.”</p>\n<p>NBC and the site have won numerous awards, including a 2013 Peabody Award for a yearlong series on poverty, “In Plain Sight.” The Peabody citation noted how NBC used its website to run 100 stories in addition to those it aired on several network television programs. NBC News and MSNBC received a 2014 Peabody Award for its reporting on the Islamic State’s rise in the Middle East.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles are credited to content creators. Biographical information, and sometimes email addresses and other contact information, are generally listed at the end of articles.</p>\n<p>The site also posts information about several newsroom managers, with full biographies for prominent NBC personalities, such as “Nightly News” anchor Lester Holt. Biographical information is also provided for writers of opinion.</p>\n<p>NBCNews.com discloses its relationship with NBCUniversal and ownership by Comcast on its About Us page.</p>\n<p>Advertising and sponsored content are clearly differentiated from news and analysis.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>NBC was central to the evolution of TV and radio. The network was an offshoot of the Radio Corporation of America founded by David Sarnoff, a Russian immigrant who came to New York City in 1900 as a child and was a pioneer in the development of both radio and television. </p>\n<p>As a protégé of radio inventor Guglielmo Marconi, Sarnoff wrote a famous “radio box memo” that proposed developing and marketing a radio receiver for use in homes. RCA proceeded to do both, while also creating NBC in 1926.</p>\n<p>Sarnoff perceived the prospects for television and successfully demonstrated the new medium at the 1939 World’s Fair in New York. RCA became a leader in manufacturing televisions, including developing the first ones compatible with both black and white and color images, while NBC created a television network and programming. When he dies in 1971, his New York Times obituary, said, “Through the Radio Corporation of America, later to become simply the RCA Corporation, and N.B.C., he set the model for the communications industry. His knowledge and ambition were the driving force behind the development of the electronic media and their profound effect on American life.”</p>\n<p>Floyd Gibbons, a former Chicago Tribune foreign correspondent, hosted the first daily radio news program over NBC’s Red Network on February 24, 1930. NBC’s Lowell Thomas broadcast the first televised news program in 1939, which was a simulcast of a radio show he did. In 1947, it moved “Meet the Press” from radio to television, where it became a Sunday morning staple and became longest-running show in television history. </p>\n<p>In 1952, it launched the weekday morning “Today” show, with folksy Chicago TV host Dave Garroway, that also became a national staple.</p>\n<p>In 1956, NBC paired Chet Huntley and David Brinkley as co-anchors of a nightly newscast. They became household names during a 14-year-run. Their successors also thrived, including John Chancellor and Tom Brokaw. The news division’s reporting achievements include coverage of the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, the manned space program, the Watergate scandal that prompted the resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon, Hurricane Katrina, and poverty in America.</p>\n<p>NBC’s online news coverage was launched in 1996 as msnbc.com, but NBC and MSNBC became separate sites in 2012. While NBCNews.com once largely was comprised of previously aired broadcast and cable video, in recent years it has placed greater emphasis on creating original video and text content.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This Nutrition Label has been updated, and its rating has been changed, to reflect that NBCNews.com has changed its site to provide information about content
