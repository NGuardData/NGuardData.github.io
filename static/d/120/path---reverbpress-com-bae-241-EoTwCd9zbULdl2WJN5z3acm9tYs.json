The site’s domain was registered through a domain privacy company. Its About section states, “Reverb Press is entirely self funded, drawing revenues from advertising and sponsors, subscriptions, and merchandise sales. We are opposed to dark money in politics and media, and do not receive any funding from outside organizations, or individuals.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Although the site publishes some content on entertainment, business and culture, almost all of the stories on the website focus on the Trump administration, in sharply critical, often vitriolic terms. Typical headlines on the site’s front page include “Trump’s Closeness to Putin Should Scare You Even if You Don’t Believe he’s a Traitor,” “Delusional Trump Prepares Executive Order to Protect Conservatives from Unproven Social Media Bias” and “BREAKING: National Enquirer Boss Latest To Flip on Dirty Donald Trump.”   </p>\n<p>The majority of content on the site is either reposted in full from other news organizations, including ProPublica and The Conversation, or based on the reporting of other online news sources and social media accounts. Some articles use studies or statistics to draw wider conclusions, and a handful of articles use firsthand interviews as sources.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Reverbpress.news has had to retract several false claims about Trump and his administration’s actions. In July 2016, Reverbpress.news reported that Trump had leaked classified information about a military base in Saudi Arabia, following the lead of some speculative tweets. Snopes.com was among the fact-checking organizations to debunk the story, and the site published a retraction to the article the next day. </p>\n<p>The site also corrected a fake tweet from a Donald J. Trump parody Twitter account that it shared in April 2018 after Snopes.com reported that the tweet was not real. In a Facebook post about the retraction, Reverb Press wrote: “We are committed to fact checking, not just in our articles, but in everything we share. When we find something in error, we will always correct the record.”</p>\n<p>On June 22nd, 2018, the website was again flagged by a fact-checking organization — this time PolitiFact — for publishing a story that claimed migrant children were being kept in dog kennels, calling them “Trump’s immigrant concentration camps”. Reverb Press responded with a published retort that the story was not referring to Nazi concentration camps, but to “concentration camps in the broader sense, such as those where American Japanese were held during World War Two.” The site did not correct the headline — “HOT STORY: Children in Dog Kennels, Suicide – Inside Trump’s Immigrant Concentration Camps”, which suggested that children were actually being held in dog kennels, a claim which was not verified by other news organizations.</p>\n<p>Reverbpress.news has falsely claimed on its site that it was an investigative news partner with the Pulitzer Prize-winning nonprofit journalism outlet ProPublica. Several stories that the site has republished from ProPublica contained notes saying that they were “co-published with ProPublica, our Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative news partner.\" In addition, ProPublica’s July 9th story by Abrahm Lustgarten, \"Bombs In Our Backyard: How the EPA and the Pentagon Downplayed a Growing Toxic Threat\" was republished by reverbpress.news on July 10 under the byline Suman Sridhar with the headline \"Investigative Report: Americans Are Being Poisoned – and the Government is Covering it Up\". </p>\n<p>ProPublica spokesperson Minhee Cho, told NewsGuard that no formal republishing partnership between ProPublica and Reverb Press exists, and ProPublica contacted Reverb Press for an explanation.</p>\n<p>After ProPublica contacted Reverb Press, the site changed the story’s byline and removed references on the website claiming they were a partner with ProPublica. However, as of October 2018, reverbpress.news still posts articles from ProPublica under more sensationalized headlines. For example, an August 2018 article from ProPublica headlined “The Shadow Rulers of the VA” was reposted on reverbpress.news with the headline “Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Cronies Exposed Secretly Running — And Ca$hing In On — The VA“. </p>\n<p>Headlines and articles are often sensationalized, and present opinion as fact. For example, in the article “Sarah Huckabee Sanders Can Go F**K Herself”, the author writes: “Sarah Huckabee Sanders is a lying, treasonous, soulless minister of propaganda. She is a fetid, reeking, pus-filled abscess in the heart of the fight for freedom of the fourth estate, of civil and constitutional rights.” Many headlines on the site can be inflammatory towards President Trump, such as ““Chickenshit Trump Wimping Out on World Summit Like a Whipped Dog” and “OMFG: The Official Trump Presidential Coin Looks LIke A Hideous Vegas Whorehouse Token.”</p>\n<p>The site does not include a corrections policy, and does not have a history of regularly publishing corrections.</p>\n<p>On Oct. 11, 2018, Facebook removed Reverb Press’ page on the site as part of a purge of 559 pages and 251 accounts “that have consistently broken our rules against spam and coordinated inauthentic behavior.”</p>\n<p>Because Reverbpress.news quickly corrected false stories about Trump on its site, it meets NewsGuard’s standard for not repeatedly publishing false content. But because of the content’s initial publication, as well as hyperpartisan opinions in news stories and misrepresentations of a partnership with ProPublica, Newsguard has determined it does not gather and present information responsibly, or handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>Reverbpress.news did not respond to two Facebook messages seeking comment on the site’s content, use of opinion, lack of corrections, and continued publication of ProPublica content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site does not post information on its ownership or management. Articles are credited to writers, with bylines normally linking to a short biography. No contact information for authors is provided. The site labels its advertisements. The site’s Contact page suggests that readers use Facebook or Twitter to contact them, with links to their social media accounts. </p>\n<p>Reverbpress.news did not respond to two Facebook messages seeking comment on why no information about ownership or management is provided on the site. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Reverb Press Facebook page states it was founded on 12 November 2014. The domain name reverbpress.news was registered on March 13, 2018. The domain name reverbpress.com, which redirects to reverbpress.news, was registered on November 13th, 2014.</p>\n<p>In October 2018, the site’s Facebook page was removed</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written
