The site was registered in Giles’ home state of Texas through a company that conceals official ownership.</p>\n<p>Giles has published a number of books expressing his views on masculinity, hunting, and culture, including “Pussification: The Effeminization of the American Male” and “Rise, Kill &#x26; Eat; A Theology of Hunting from Genesis to Revelation.” He also co-hosts a podcast showcasing Christian values, “Warriors and Wildmen,” and sells oil and charcoal paintings, which are mostly of animals, but also include portraits of President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump.</p>\n<p>The website runs advertisements, but reader donations also partly fund the site. In soliciting donations, ClashDaily.com says “‘social media’ and radical leftists are seeking to shut down speech they don’t agree with … and have effectively gone after our advertisers to our detriment.” The site also advertises Giles’ other products: Users can download the “Warriors and Wildmen” podcast, buy Giles’ paintings, books, and other merchandise, including T-shirts with the slogans “JOUR-NAL-LIST: A Professional Liar For Liberal Causes” and “Liberalism is a… MENTAL DISORDER.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>ClashDaily calls itself “a mosh pit of breaking news, edgy opinion, lots of attitude, and a call to action for God- and country-loving patriots.” Although ClashDaily.com maintains separate sections for news, opinion and videos, the sections all post the same content -- political and general news that reflect a conservative, pro-Trump perspective. News stories appearing on the site in September 2018 covered the Texas U.S. Senate campaign (“Watch: Beto Gets Booed During Debate -- Cruz Takes Him To Truth City”), sexual misconduct accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh (“Here’s Why Timid Republicans Must Share the Blame for the Kavanaugh Circus”) and a shooting at a Maryland Rite Aid (“The Rite Aid Shooter Has Been ID’ed -- It Wasn’t A Conservative.”) The site’s writers add commentary to reporting largely based on social media posts and news reports from other outlets including Fox News, Reuters, and the Daily Mail. </p>\n<p>The “Warriors and Wildmen” podcast is also linked right below the site’s banner, with episode titles including “Who Would Jesus Troll? Should Christians Argue With Idiots On Social Media?” and “Dear Christian: Does Your Work Scream, ‘Awesome’ or ‘Awful?’”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>ClashDaily.com has repeatedly published articles containing falsehoods and promoting debunked conspiracy theories. A May 2018 post described David Hogg, among other students attending a Parkland, Florida, high school where 17 people were killed in a February 2018 shooting, as a crisis actor.  After accurately describing Hogg as “a seventeen-year-old student from Parkland,” the post says it is “questionable whether Hogg was even on campus during the shooting” -- a claim contrary to all available evidence. (The Miami Herald posted video footage it said Hogg took from inside the school at the time of the shooting.)</p>\n<p><br>The site has published multiple articles suggesting Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer who was shot dead in 2016, leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks. A post on the site from May 2017 says, “There was NO hacker. But there WAS a leaker. His name was Seth Rich.” Another story from that month calls Rich “a whistleblower to Wikileaks” and suggested his 2016 death could be connected to his alleged ties to WikiLeaks. No credible evidence backs these claims. In May 2017, Rich’s parents wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that detectives examined Rich’s personal computer and personal email and found no evidence of communications with WikiLeaks.</p>\n<p>A post from January 2018, headlined “The Clinton Body Count…Real or Imagined?” makes the unsubstantiated suggestion that former president Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may be connected to the “questionable” deaths of at least 30 “associates.” The list includes Rich. “In the United States of America nobody is supposed to be above the law,” the post says. “So, why are the Clintons getting a free pass?”</p>\n<p>Most news stories include opinions that reflect the site’s overall perspective, even if the stories are not on related topics. They also embed text that advertises Giles’ paintings and books. For example, a September 2018 story on a Texas mayor who fatally shot an alligator on her property, concludes, “Does your grandpa go off on paltry politicians, whether they be Democrats or Republicans? Does he gets misty-eyed when he talks about God and Country and America’s future? … If you answered yes to one, or all of the above, then your gramps’ will love Doug Giles’ latest book, “My Grandpa Is A Patriotic Badass.’” Several other stories on the site conclude with commentary such as “Our new First Couple is here to Make America Great Again” and showcases a Giles portrait of Donald and Melania Trump, each carrying handguns, and a link to purchase the portrait.</p>\n<p>Because the site routinely injects opinion in stories presented as news, NewsGuard has concluded that it does not responsibly handle the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<p>Headlines on the site are regularly sensational and deceptive, often including insults of prominent Democrats. Examples from July 2018 include “Clash Poll: What’s Nuttier – Maxine Waters Or This Granola Bar?” and “LMAO: Trump Offers Fauxcahontas A Cool $1M To Take A DNA Test,” a reference to Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose Native American heritage led to Trump nicknaming her “Pocahontas.” Although it is not accompanied by any story text, a headline to a blank story page from 2013 that remains on the site says “Welcome to Kenya: Birthplace of Barack Obama,” perpetuating the debunked conspiracy theory that Obama was not born in the United States. </p>\n<p>As of September 2018, NewsGuard found only one recent correction on ClashDaily.com, posted to a story about the California professor who has accused Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school. The original story -- which was shared widely, especially on conservative media -- asserted that the professor, Christine Blasey Ford, had received negative ratings from her students. The corrected version contained a note at the top and deleted the text that incorrectly attributed the ratings to Christine Blasey Ford, when they were actually of another professor, at another university, also named Christine Ford.</p>\n<p>Other false articles on the site remain uncorrected. Because the site leaves false stories uncorrected, even after they have been proven false, and injects commercial messages into editorial content, NewsGuard has determined ClashDaily.com does not does not gather and present information responsibly.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard submitted two contact forms on ClashDaily.com and emailed a message to an address listed on the site’s Facebook page, asking about its record of publishing false content, its mixing of news and opinion, and its approach to corrections. The messages received no response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>A Contact Us page includes a contact form and links to the site’s social media accounts. Posts typically identify authors above the story text. Readers can click on names to access pages with brief biographies of writers.</p>\n<p>Giles is identified as the person in charge of the site, although the site does not clearly disclose he is the owner.</p>\n<p>Advertisements for business unrelated to Giles are clearly labeled on the site, but advertisements for Giles’ products are embedded in news articles -- which has led NewsGuard to determine that ClashDaily.com does not clearly advertising. Two messages sent to the site’s contact form and an email to an address listed on the site’s Facebook page asking about its lack of disclosure about its ownership and about its labeling of advertising received no response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>ClashDaily.com was founded in the summer of 2012.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSam Howard\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric
