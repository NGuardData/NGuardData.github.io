Digital First generates revenue from subscriptions and advertising in its printed publications and digital products. It also operates AdTaxi, a programmatic advertising product for businesses.</p>\n<p>Digital First Media is owned by Alden Global Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that has been the subject of controversy because of substantial staff cuts at Digital First Media properties. In 2018, staff members at The Denver Post and the Bay Area News Group engaged in a series of public protests and ran editorials against Alden’s ownership, with The Denver Post publicly describing its owners as “vulture capitalists.”</p>\n<p>The Detroit News shares its business operation with the Detroit Free Press, while maintaining its own editorial staff.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Detroitnews.com focuses on local news coverage. It has a robust auto section, with separate sections for each of the Big Three auto manufacturers based in and around Detroit. The auto sections publish broad coverage of business and consumer aspects of the industry, from new car models to labor unions representing industry workers. The site also features sports, home, life and local entertainment news, along with a clearly labeled opinion section. Most articles reflect original reporting by Detroit News staff members. The site also runs Associated Press stories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Headlines and articles are objective and factual, often based on firsthand interviews by Detroit News reporters. The site’s staff directory  lists 39 reporters, including those assigned to bureaus in Washington and the state capital of Lansing, Michigan.</p>\n<p>The editorial board has traditionally supported Republican candidates. It has never endorsed a Democrat for president. According to its editorial endorsing Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson in the 2016 presidential election, the paper has declined to endorse a presidential candidate three times: twice when Franklin D. Roosevelt was running for president and in 2004 when it declined to endorse President George W. Bush for re-election.</p>\n<p>The site’s Corrections &#x26; Clarifications page explains that “The Detroit News promptly corrects factual errors or clarifies misleading information,” offers phone, fax, and email contacts for readers to point out errors, and keeps a running list of published corrections. Corrections are also disclosed at the top of the articles found to contain errors. </p>\n<p>The organization won a 2017 Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists for Public Service Journalism for a series about how Detroit landlords had been ignoring city inspection requirements. The articles resulted in the Detroit City Council passing new rent regulations allowing tenants to avoid eviction by putting their rent in escrow until landlords meet the city requirements.</p>\n<p>The Detroit News was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in 2003 and won a Pulitzer in 1994 for exposing corruption in a state agency.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Digital First Media’s ownership is disclosed in a copyright at the bottom of each page. Most stories are credited to writers, with the exception of some Associated Press stories. Readers who click on the names of Detroit News reporters are redirected to a page listing email addresses and Twitter accounts for each writer, and links to his or her recent work. The “Staff Directory” page lists email addresses and phone numbers for the site’s top newsroom management, its publisher, reporters, and editors of every department, as well as for its website staff. The “Contact Us” page includes phone numbers and email addresses for individual departments. Ads are clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History </h3>\n<p>The Detroit News was founded in 1873. It has shared business operations with the Detroit Free Press since 1987, while maintaining separate editorial staffs. The site was created in 1997. The newspaper was owned by Gannett from 1985 until 2005, when Gannett took over the Free Press. The Detroit News was in turn sold to MediaNews Group, which adopted the name Digital First Media in 2013. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJohn Gregory\n\nEdited by:\nJim Warren&#x26;emsp;Joyce
