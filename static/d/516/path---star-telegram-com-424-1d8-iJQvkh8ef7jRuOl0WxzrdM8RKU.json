The site earns revenue from advertising and subscriptions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Star-Telegram provides local and national news, sports, business, and opinion sections. Wire services including The Associated Press and The Washington Post News Service provide coverage of national and international news. The sports section covers professional, collegiate, and high school teams in Texas. The Star-Telegram offers several editions that cover individual towns within the Dallas-Fort Worth area. A Spanish-language edition is also available on the website.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Staff reporters, including a digital reporter and editor, create content for Star-Telegram.com. Headlines on the site are fair, balanced, and accurately reflect information in stories. Although the website does not have a visible corrections policy, corrections are regularly made in stories.</p>\n<p>The Star-Telegram over the years has won several prestigious awards for journalism. In 1981, a photographer at the newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for his photos of Liberian officials being executed by firing squad. In 1985, The Star-Telegram won a Pulitzer Prize in the Public Service category for an investigative story that revealed a design flaw in Bell Helicopters. Star-Telegram’s reporting found that the flaw had caused the deaths of 250 U.S. servicemen. The story ultimately led the Army to ground hundreds of helicopters.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Advertising is distinguished from editorial content. After a previous version of this Nutrition Label was published, McClatchy sites, including Star-Telegram.com, began labeling articles from content recommendation firm ZergNet with the heading “FROM OUR ADVERTISING PARTNERS.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Star-Telegram was founded in 1906 as the Fort Worth Star. In 1982, the newspaper published one of the country’s first electronic newspapers, StarText, which could be read on a computer. The website was registered in 1996.</p>\n<p><em>Editor's Note: This Nutrition Label has been updated, and its rating has changed, after McClatchy sites began labeling paid content hosted by content recommendation firm ZergNet. The site now meets NewsGuard’s standard for labeling advertising.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/archives/knight-ridder-newspaper-chain-agrees-to-sale.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/archives/knight-ridder-newspaper-chain-agrees-to-sale.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5260417\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5260417</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/larry-c-price\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/larry-c-price</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/fort-worth-tx-star-telegram\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/fort-worth-tx-star-telegram</a></li>\n<li> -<a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/star-telegram.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.whois.com/whois/star-telegram.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/customer-service/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.star-telegram.com/customer-service/about-us/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-03/news/mn-65_1_electronic-newspaper/4\" target=\"_blank\">http://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-03/news/mn-65<em>1</em>electronic-newspaper/4</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/customer-service/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.star-telegram.com/customer-service/about-us/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article212133724.html(corrections)\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article212133724.html(corrections)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mcclatchy.com/our-impact/markets/star-telegram\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mcclatchy.com/our-impact/markets/star-telegram</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cision.com/us/2014/07/top-10-daily-newspapers-in-texas/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cision.com/us/2014/07/top-10-daily-newspapers-in-texas/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/1981\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/1981</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"star-telegram.com","author":"Evan Haddad","date":"2019-02-25T18:31:34.760+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/star-telegram.com/"}}
