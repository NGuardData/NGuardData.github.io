It is financed by contributions from individuals, foundations, and corporations. Heritage has received funding from major conservative donor organizations, including the foundations of Richard Scaife, David Koch and Charles Koch, and organizations with ties to the Koch brothers.</p>\n<p>The Heritage Foundation owns and operates a news website, The Daily Signal (dailysignal.com.) The foundation is also affiliated with Heritage Action for America, a lobbying organization founded in 2010.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Heritage.org publishes commentary pieces and podcasts, research reports, congressional testimony, videos of Heritage media appearances, and articles on foundation news. The site also advertises upcoming Heritage Foundation events, solicits donations, and encourages visitors to become members. Content on the site reflects the foundation’s stances, which the site makes clear.</p>\n<p>An Explore Issues tab links to more than 40 topics related to domestic and international public policy, highlighting the foundation’s top issues: Taxes, Health Care Reform, Budget and Spending, Immigration, and Terrorism. Each page articulates the Heritage Foundation’s position on the issue. Publications contain bullet points of “key takeaways” at the top, for quick digestion. Heritage.org publishes content ranging in length from what it calls “one minute read” pieces, to in- depth reports.</p>\n<p>Heritage.org once housed a blog, The Foundry, until it was phased out in 2014, replaced by dailysignal.com. Many opinion pieces from the Daily Signal are now reproduced on Heritage.org.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Heritage is recognized as one of the top think tanks in the world. In its 2017 rankings, The Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program at the University of Pennsylvania rated Heritage as the fourth most influential think tank in the U.S., and eighth globally. Much<em> </em>of the research produced by Heritage is widely cited, especially its annual Index of Economic Freedom, which ranks nations in terms of the amount of control citizens have over their labor and property.</p>\n<p>The Heritage Foundation has helped staff President Trump’s administration and shape its agenda, with approximately 70 former Heritage employees working on the Trump transition team or in his administration. </p>\n<p>One year after the president’s inauguration, Heritage released Blueprint for Impact, a report celebrating how President Trump had embraced 64 percent of the foundation’s agenda. The site’s home page in August 2018 also prominently stated “Donald Trump and many Republican Congressmen promised they’d drain the swamp. And Heritage is here to help them do just that!”</p>\n<p>Reports, testimonials, and commentary on the site are deeply sourced, including government documents, studies by credible research organizations such as the Pew Research Center, and articles in leading media outlets such as The New York Times. Research pieces provide a full list of references.</p>\n<p>Heritage.org is explicit about the agenda that drives its content, articulating its conservative principles on its home page, About page, and throughout the site. All content is clearly labeled as a report, testimony, video, or commentary, distinguishing opinion from research. Headlines are representative, and writing is straightforward.</p>\n<p>The Heritage Foundation has received criticism, primarily from the left, for its interpretation of facts, especially related to immigration. Two reports from 2007 and 2013 estimating how much it would cost taxpayers to legalize undocumented immigrants were widely decried for their methodologies by writers for The New York Times, the libertarian Cato Institute, and the conservative National Review. Critics said the reports overstated the cost of immigrants by mistakenly assuming all immigrants living in the U.S. would receive amnesty, and understated their positive economic contributions by assuming they would stay in low-skilled jobs rather than move upward. Jason Richwine, a co-author of the report, resigned from Heritage following the backlash in 2013, but the foundation did not correct or alter the report.</p>\n<p>The site does not articulate a corrections policy, nor does it appear to update content when errors have been made. Heritage did not respond to three emails from NewsGuard inquiring about the site’s approach to corrections. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Heritage.org discloses that the Heritage Foundation is a conservative nonprofit funded by donations from individuals, corporations, and foundations. The site publishes annual reports, IRS 990 forms, and financial audit statements for the foundation.</p>\n<p>The site names the Heritage Foundation’s leaders, board of trustees, experts, and other staff, usually providing their biography, photo, and a means to contact them or request an interview. Reports and commentary pieces name their author, providing the same information.</p>\n<p>A Contact page provides a feedback form, email address, and phone number for general inquiries.</p>\n<p>The site does not run advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Heritage Foundation was founded in 1973 by Paul Weyrich and Edwin J. Feulner, former aides to Republican congressmen, and Joseph Coors, whose fortune from his family’s brewing company helped finance the foundation. The organization departed from the nonpartisan norm of think tanks at the time by taking conservative advocacy positions. </p>\n<p>Feulner served as president of the organization from 1977 through 2013, then briefly as interim president in 2017, after his successor, former Republican senator Jim DeMint, was ousted for “management issues,” according to the chairman of Heritage’s Board of Trustees. Kay Cole James, who directed the Office of Personnel Management under President George Bush, took over as president in January 2018. </p>\n<p>Since its inception, Heritage has had a record of influencing the policies of conservative leaders and lawmakers, particularly in 1980 with the election of President Ronald Reagan. Heritage drafted a Mandate for Leadership prescribing policy recommendations during Reagan’s transition into office, 60 percent of which he enacted during his presidency, according to the foundation.</p>\n<p>Heritage continued to play a dominant role in politics until the early 2000s, when its prominence waned under the presidency of George W. Bush, who favored other conservative groups such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Project for the New American Century. Following the 2008 election of Barack Obama, the foundation gained renewed traction. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric
