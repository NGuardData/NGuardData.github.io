Tribune owns newspapers and publications in major markets, including the New York Daily News, Orlando Sentinel, and its flagship publication, the Chicago Tribune.</p>\n<p>Tribune generates its revenue through advertising and subscriptions for its printed and digital products. Its publications have won numerous awards, including a Pulitzer Prize in 2017.</p>\n<p>Baltimoresun.com runs advertisements, charges for online subscriptions, and runs sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Baltimore Sun and its website produce professionally reported and written political, cultural, sports, and entertainment coverage that is influential in Baltimore and statewide. The homepage  offers a variety of content ranging from breaking news at City Hall and the statehouse in Annapolis to the changing fortunes of Baltimore’s major league sports teams.</p>\n<p>It also features separate sections on health, opinion and real estate, and timely content on topics such as local proms and The Preakness Stakes, an annual horse race held in Baltimore.</p>\n<p>The site features original reporting by its own staff, as well as content from wire services such as The Associated Press.</p>\n<p>In addition to text, BaltimoreSun.com publishes videos and podcasts, a PDF of the paper’s daily print edition, and an archive of previous editions of the paper.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site’s Opinion section is separate from its news content. However, opinion pieces are not always immediately identifiable, with only a small “Opinion / Editorial” disclaimer in the top right corner. For example, a June 2018 article titled “With SCOTUS decision, voters more than ever need to use it or lose it” includes no byline and no indication that the piece was written by the Baltimore Sun’s editorial board.</p>\n<p>Kalani Gordon, a senior editor for analytics and digital products at the Sun, noted that the “editorial” label appears near the headline. But she told NewsGuard the Sun will look for a way to more clearly differentiate the pieces in the future.</p>\n<p>The site regularly issues corrections, and the change is described at the end of the story, Gordon said. Images are attributed.</p>\n<p>The Sun has won 15 Pulitzer Prizes -- the most recent of which was for health care reporting in 2003.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The names of all editorial and reporting staff are listed in the “Newsroom Directory” page, with profiles featuring contact and biographical information. The “Customer Service” page also lists general phone numbers and email addresses. Users can read profiles of writers by clicking on their names.</p>\n<p>The site discloses its ownership. Advertisements are clearly distinguished from news content. “Paid Post” content includes a disclaimer disclosing that the ownership either paid for or produced the content, independent of the news department.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Baltimore Sun was founded in 1837 by philanthropist and publisher A.S. Abell as a four-page tabloid. It was also owned by a Maryland television station, WMAR-TV, for 40 years.</p>\n<p>In 1986, the newspaper was purchased by the Times Mirror Company (owner of the Los Angeles Times, among other dailies). Times Mirror then became part of the Tribune Company in 2000, which later rebranded with a new name, Tronc (shorthand for “Tribune Online Content”).</p>\n<p>Tronc has suffered the economic woes afflicting many legacy newspaper companies, exacerbated by internal battles over corporate control and strategy. This has forced a series of cutbacks in the Baltimore Sun’s staff, closing its once-flourishing regional and foreign bureaus.</p>\n<p>Tronc switched its name back to Tribune Publishing Company in 2018, after two years.</p>\n<p>Among the celebrated journalists who have worked at the newspaper are H.L. Mencken, Richard Ben Cramer,         Russell Baker and David Simon, who created the hit HBO series The Wire. The Sun’s agenda-setting influence on government, politics, and policing in Baltimore was a major storyline in the series’ fifth season.           </p>\n<p>The website was launched in 1996.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSteven Brill\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
