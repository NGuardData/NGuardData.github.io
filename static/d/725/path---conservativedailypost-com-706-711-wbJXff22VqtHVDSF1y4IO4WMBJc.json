The site runs advertisements and promoted content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Conservativedailypost.com covers national and international political news. Articles are often sourced from other outlets, including prominent conservative news sites such as Breitbart.com. Because the site’s stories do not appear chronologically, outdated articles are often featured. In addition to text, the site posts videos under the categories “protests,” “explosive interviews,” “viral,” and “mainstream media.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Conservativedailypost.com has been criticized by non-partisan fact-checking websites. Politifact lists the site on its “fake news almanac.” Snopes has called it “disreputable” and “notoriously hyperpartisan” and says it has “a history of severely misrepresenting real events.” Media Bias/Fact Check has it listed as “Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy.”</p>\n<p>The site often uses charged language. It has called Black Lives Matter “a domestic terror group,” for example, and an article about gun control stated that “[t]he Left would rather outright ban all firearms in America and disarm the people than admit it takes a psychopath to kill innocent people, not the gun.”</p>\n<p>The site does not distinguish between news and opinion, and many news stories portray opinion as fact. For example, the headline “Pro-Life Group Exposes Planned Parenthood Cover Up In New Report” links to a story that describes those who perform abortions for underage sexual-abuse victims as engaging in “child sexual abuse and human trafficking cover-up.”</p>\n<p>In late 2016, the site posted articles lending credence to a debunked conspiracy theory that linked Hillary Clinton and other Democrats to an alleged pedophile ring at a Washington, D.C., pizza parlor. Those articles remain on the site.</p>\n<p>Articles typically link to other ConservativeDailyPost.com articles as sources for information, but some provide external sources as well. In December 2017, the website re-published a New York Times story verbatim, only crediting the Times by a “H/T NY Times” (hat-tip) postscript that linked to the original article.</p>\n<p>Conservativedailypost.com does not include a corrections policy, and no corrections were found on the site.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site’s About Us page links to Editors and Writers pages, but they were blank. Articles include the names of writers, with links to biographical information, but no contact information is provided. Readers can reach staff through a generic contact form and email address provided on the site’s terms of service page, and there is no clearly marked way for readers to report errors for correction.</p>\n<p>Conservativedailypost.com does not disclose its financing or ownership, except to note the site is a copyright of Conservative Daily Post, about which no further information is available online.</p>\n<p>The site did not respond to a submitted contact form and to an email inquiring about its history of publishing false content, its lack of information about its owner and editors, its lack of corrections, and its blending of opinion and news content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Conservative Daily Post was launched during the 2016 election.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSam Howard\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/conservative-daily-post/statements/byruling/pants-fire/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.politifact.com/personalities/conservative-daily-post/statements/byruling/pants-fire/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-country-owes-gratitude/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-country-owes-gratitude/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/law-charges-protesters-with-terrorism/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/law-charges-protesters-with-terrorism/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/ms-world-says-right-wing-facebook-page-is-fake/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.courthousenews.com/ms-world-says-right-wing-facebook-page-is-fake/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/apr/20/politifacts-guide-fake-news-websites-and-what-they/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/apr/20/politifacts-guide-fake-news-websites-and-what-they/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://conservativedailypost.com/dems-pass-bill-election-auto-register-suit-claimed-forms-burden/\" target=\"_blank\">https://conservativedailypost.com/dems-pass-bill-election-auto-register-suit-claimed-forms-burden/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fake-news-site-steals-womans-identity-turning-her-into-right-wing-blogger/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fake-news-site-steals-womans-identity-turning-her-into-right-wing-blogger/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://conservativedailypost.com/terms-of-service/\" target=\"_blank\">https://conservativedailypost.com/terms-of-service/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mediakit.breitbart.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://mediakit.breitbart.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://conservativedailypost.com/pro-life-group-exposes-planned-parenthood-cover-up-in-new-report/\" target=\"_blank\">https://conservativedailypost.com/pro-life-group-exposes-planned-parenthood-cover-up-in-new-report/</a></li>\n<li>Pizzagate: <a href=\"https://conservativedailypost.com/just-in-anthony-weiner-to-face-charges-for-pizzagate-entire-underground-clinton-cult-revealed/;\" target=\"_blank\">https://conservativedailypost.com/just-in-anthony-weiner-to-face-charges-for-pizzagate-entire-underground-clinton-cult-revealed/;</a> <a href=\"https://conservativedailypost.com/u-s-government-coverup-pizzagate-investigators-now-being-threatened-by-the-establishment/\">https://conservativedailypost.com/u-s-government-coverup-pizzagate-investigators-now-being-threatened-by-the-establishment/</a>;
