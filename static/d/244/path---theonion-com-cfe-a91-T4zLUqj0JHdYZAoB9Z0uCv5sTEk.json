{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<div class=\"right-score\">Score: 0</div>\n<h1>theonion.com&emsp; <span class=\"net-country\">(WEB - en-US)</span></h1>\n<p>One of the most popular satire sites in the United States that mimics news coverage with made-up stories.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>The Onion<em> </em>was founded in 1988 as a weekly print newspaper in Madison, Wisconsin, by college students Tim Keck and Christopher Johnson, who intended for it to be a local humor paper that sold coupons. TheOnion.com launched in 1996 while the print paper grew to a peak circulation of roughly 500,000, according to Fortune<em>. </em></p>\n<p>The Onion publishes articles that look like news coverage of politics, sports, and entertainment, along with other humor stories and videos. Some Onion<em> </em>headlines have been mistaken for legitimate news. </p>\n<p>Foreign publications, in particular, have published articles that attribute The Onion<em> </em>as a legitimate news source. In 2002, Chinese newspaper Beijing Evening News based a news article on the piece titled, “Congress Threatens To Leave D.C. Unless New Capital Is Built.” </p>\n<p>The target of The Onion’s satire represent all political sides. A story headlined “Black Guy Given Nation’s Worst Job” was published after Barack Obama was elected president in 2008. Following the release of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s book “What Happened,” The Onion<em> </em>published “Clinton Already Working On Follow-Up Book Casting Blame For Failures Of First.” When Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, The Onion<em> </em>reported his victory with the headline, “Nation Throws Off Tyrannical Yoke Of Moderate Respect For Women.” </p>\n<p>After the Charlottesville, Virginia, white supremacist rallies that led to violence in 2017, The Onion published a story titled, “White Supremacist Tired After Long Day Of Interviews With Mainstream News Outlets.”</p>\n<p>The Onion has defended its equal-opportunity satire. In 2008, staff writer Joe Garden told The Washington Post<em>, </em>“I wouldn’t say we have the broadest spectrum of political inclinations on our staff, but we’re not here to be a pal to liberals or to be a mouthpiece for the Democratic Party. We’re here to make fun of things that are dumb.”</p>\n<p>In a 2017 interview with the Sydney Morning Herald, Onion managing editor Marnie Shure said The Onion differentiates itself from sites that fabricate news by “training,” rather than tricking, readers to recognize its satirical style. “Our intentions are entirely divergent from what you see with a lot of the fake news you see in the zeitgeist,” she said.</p>\n<p>TheOnion.com includes Onion Social<em>, </em>a parody of social media platforms, such as Facebook, and tabs linking to several other sites in the Fusion Media Group that owns it, including the satirical Clickhole<em> </em>and<em> </em>entertainment review site A.V. Club. The Onion<em> </em>has published content in several other media including books, TV, film, and podcasts. </p>\n<p>The Onion has maneuvered to keep pace with changes in the media industry, revamping its site design and providing more real-time coverage of political conventions. Its 2016 convention videos challenged established online publications, such as The New York Times, NBC,<em> </em>and CNN,<em> </em>for web traffic<em>. </em></p>\n<p>One of the only times The Onion has removed content was in 2013, when it called nine-year-old Academy Awards Best Actress nominee Quvenzhané Wallis a misogynist slur in a tweet. Onion Inc. CEO Steve Hannah published an apology after deleting the tweet, saying the post was, “crude and offensive — not to mention inconsistent with The Onion’s commitment to parody and satire, however biting.” </p>\n<p>The Onion’s tagline is “America’s Finest News Source.” It does not identify itself as a humor or satire site. An About section alludes to its humorous style with a mission statement saying, “Rising from its humble beginnings as a print newspaper in 1756, The Onion<em> </em>now enjoys a daily readership of 4.3 trillion and has grown into the single most powerful and influential organization in human history.” </p>\n<p>Financial consultant David Schafer bought The Onion<em> </em>for $4 million in 2003, and the print newspaper was discontinued in 2013. The parent company of Spanish-language TV broadcaster Univision bought a 40 percent stake in the media company and option to buy the remaining stock for an unconfirmed price in 2016, with<em> </em>Onion Inc.’s The Onion, Clickhole, and A.V. Club all joining Univision’s Fusion Media Group. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nMacaela Bennett\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fusion Media Group <a href=\"http://thefmg.com/our-brands\" target=\"_blank\">http://thefmg.com/our-brands </a></li>\n<li>Univision company profile <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=352350\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=352350 </a></li>\n<li>Onion company profile <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=33364659\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=33364659 </a></li>\n<li>Univision buys stake in The Onion <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/business/media/univision-buying-large-stake-in-the-onion.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/business/media/univision-buying-large-stake-in-the-onion.html </a></li>\n<li>Univision buys stake in The Onion  <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a255d698-beb1-11e5-846f-79b0e3d20eaf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ft.com/content/a255d698-beb1-11e5-846f-79b0e3d20eaf </a></li>\n<li>Univision buys stake in The Onion <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/19/463535648/area-satiric-publication-the-onion-sold-to-univision-seriously\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/19/463535648/area-satiric-publication-the-onion-sold-to-univision-seriously </a></li>\n<li>“The Onion Is Not a Joke: How a fake newspaper is turning into a real media empire” <a href=\"http://archive.today/KpugX\" target=\"_blank\">http://archive.today/KpugX </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/the-onion-approach-to-branded-content/\" target=\"_blank\">https://digiday.com/marketing/the-onion-approach-to-branded-content/ </a></li>\n<li>\n<p>Onion Labs <a href=\"https://onionlabs.theonion.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://onionlabs.theonion.com/ </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li>“Picky Refugee Just Expects To Be Reunited With Exact Same Family As Before”  <a href=\"http://archive.today/tKPj0\" target=\"_blank\">http://archive.today/tKPj0 </a></li>\n<li>“CIA Realizes It’s Been Using Black Highlighters All These Years” <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180711135130/https://politics.theonion.com/cia-realizes-its-been-using-black-highlighters-all-thes-1819568147\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.archive.org/web/20180711135130/https://politics.theonion.com/cia-realizes-its-been-using-black-highlighters-all-thes-1819568147 </a></li>\n<li>“Black Man Given Nation’s Worst Job” <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180711135840/https://politics.theonion.com/black-man-given-nations-worst-job-1819570341\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.archive.org/web/20180711135840/https://politics.theonion.com/black-man-given-nations-worst-job-1819570341 </a></li>\n<li>“Congress Threatens To Leave D.C.
