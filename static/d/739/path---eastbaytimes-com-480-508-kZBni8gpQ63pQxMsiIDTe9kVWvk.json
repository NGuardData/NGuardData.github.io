Digital First generates revenue from subscriptions and advertising on its printed publications and digital products. It also operates AdTaxi, a programmatic advertising product for businesses. </p>\n<p>Digital First Media is owned by Alden Global Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that has been the subject of controversy for substantial staff cuts at Digital First Media properties. In 2018, staff at The Denver Post and the Bay Area News Group engaged in a series of public protests and editorials against Alden’s ownership, with The Denver Post publicly describing its owners as “vulture capitalists.”</p>\n<p>The site earns revenue through advertising and subscriptions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site publishes local and national news, sports, business, and opinion, and directs readers to several categories, including “Latest headlines,” and “Crime &#x26; Courts,” “Most Popular,” “Celebrities,” “Lifestyle” and “Business.” East Bay Times also uses coverage of national and international affairs from The Associated Press and The Washington Post. In addition, the site publishes community content, including obituaries, classified ads, and real estate news. The site also runs “The Cannifornian,” which a covers news in California’s cannabis industry. California-based news organizations owned by Digital First Media produce the feature.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Its own reporting staff produces much of the content for The East Bay Times. Articles and headlines  are straightforward and factual, and the site attributes all photographs. The publication frequently runs corrections and clarifications. Readers can contact the site to suggest them.</p>\n<p>The site clearly distinguishes between news and opinion. In 2017, the paper won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the “Ghost Ship” fire, which killed 36 people at a warehouse party.</p>\n<p>In March 2018, reporters from The East Bay times rallied to protest against Alden Global Capital, claiming that the company’s cost-cutting measures have hurt its newsroom. Union representatives have said Digital First’s 12 newspapers have reduced staff by 40 percent over the past two years, according to Hoodline.com.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The East Bay Times provides detailed information about its content creators and senior management. Articles are bylined, and readers can contact authors through email addresses provided on the website. A detailed list of phone numbers of other staff members, and for specific departments, appears on the site’s “Contact Us” page. Readers can also contact executives at the publication.</p>\n<p>Eastbaytimes.com participates in the Trust Project (thetrustproject.org), in which news organizations commit to follow specific guidelines related to transparency.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>In 2016, Digital First Media consolidated several local newspapers in the East Bay area into the East Bay Times.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Joyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Bay-Area-News-Group-consolidates-newspapers-6863720.php#photo-9482493\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Bay-Area-News-Group-consolidates-newspapers-6863720.php#photo-9482493</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/digital/digital-first-media-orange-county-register-riverside-press-enterprise/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.adweek.com/digital/digital-first-media-orange-county-register-riverside-press-enterprise/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thecannifornian.com/welcome-to-the-cannifornian/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.thecannifornian.com/welcome-to-the-cannifornian/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/contact-us/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eastbaytimes.com/contact-us/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/news/corrections/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eastbaytimes.com/news/corrections/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hoodline.com/2018/03/east-bay-times-reporters-rally-against-newspaper-s-owner\" target=\"_blank\">https://hoodline.com/2018/03/east-bay-times-reporters-rally-against-newspaper-s-owner</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/04/10/east-bay-times-wins-pulitzer-prize-for-ghost-ship-fire-coverage/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/04/10/east-bay-times-wins-pulitzer-prize-for-ghost-ship-fire-coverage/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2017\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2017</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/contact-us/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eastbaytimes.com/contact-us/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Bay-Area-News-Group-consolidates-newspapers-6863720.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Bay-Area-News-Group-consolidates-newspapers-6863720.php</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"eastbaytimes.com","author":"Evan Haddad","date":"2018-10-23T10:44:36.506+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/eastbaytimes.com/"}}
