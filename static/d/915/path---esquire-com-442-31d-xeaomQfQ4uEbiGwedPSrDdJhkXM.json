It sells display ads, publishes sponsored stories, and earns affiliate fees when its visitors purchase products from ecommerce partners. Esquire also sells digital access to the magazine’s archives.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Esquire.com produces daily, staff-written news and lifestyle content on politics, entertainment, food and style, augmented by stories from other Hearst properties including <em>Runner’s World</em> and <em>Men’s Health</em>. The site’s media kit, aimed at advertisers, states that “95% of monthly content is unique to esquire.com.” </p>\n<p>The site also offers a free daily newsletter and an archive of print magazine stories by paid subscription. It publishes actively on Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.</p>\n<p>Under digital director Michael Sebastian, who took over in 2017, the site has sharpened its focus on style and e-commerce. In stories about men’s fashion and lifestyle, the editorial tone is often irreverent (“Dear Rich Young Banker Dudes, Your Bags Suck,” reads a headline on a story about luggage.)</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Stories are written in the Esquire voice (irreverent, traditionally masculine) and are not labeled as opinion. Political stories are often sharply critical of, and sometimes ridicule, the Trump administration. An article headlined  “Can the Republic Recover from Donald Trump?” is typical fare. On the eve of the 2016 presidential election, it published a pop-up version of the satirical <em>Spy</em> magazine of the 1980s, with stories mocking both candidates, but particularly Trump. </p>\n<p>Quotations and images are properly attributed. Ads, if they appear in the editorial columns, are labeled as such or are graphically set apart.</p>\n<p>Corrections are issued when needed, with notes appended to the bottom of the story in question, according to managing editor Ben Boskovich.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Each story displays links to an “About Us” page, listing the editorial and business staff, and containing an “About Our Ads” statement. The Hearst parent company is clearly referenced on every page.</p>\n<p>Products discussed in stories are linked to third-party merchant sites by a “BUY” button. The site notes: “Esquire participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites.”</p>\n<p>The site displays a physical mailing address and general telephone number on the “About Us” page, and provides an email link for letters to the editors. There is no “letters” section on the site. (Readers can post comments on the “Esquire” and “Esquire Politics” pages on Facebook.)</p>\n<p>Stories bear the byline of the author with a link to a short bio and to the writer’s Twitter, Instagram, or email accounts.</p>\n<p>A link on each page leads to “Community Guidelines” (last updated 2015), which begins: “Be respectful and civil to other members, even if you disagree with them....“</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Founded in 1933, Esquire’s first issue declared, “Esquire aims to be the common denominator of masculine interests.” It became a showcase for some of the strongest U.S. magazine writing for decades, with Norman Mailer, Tom Wolfe, and Gay Talese among its contributors. Over the last two decades, the print edition has won eight  National Magazine Awards for reporting, feature writing, and general excellence. In 2011, Esquire captured first place for Digital Media, the first time awards were given in that category. The site has been active since 2000.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nStu Rohrer\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/04/esquire-removes-satirical-article-after-criticism-004503\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/04/esquire-removes-satirical-article-after-criticism-004503</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/the_profile/david_granger_esquire.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cjr.org/the<em>profile/david</em>granger_esquire.php</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/fashion/esquire-magazine-jay-fielden.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/fashion/esquire-magazine-jay-fielden.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.esquiremediakit.com/r5/home.asp\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.esquiremediakit.com/r5/home.asp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.foliomag.com/esquire-com-increases-focus-style/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.foliomag.com/esquire-com-increases-focus-style/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/about/a26373/community-guidelines/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.esquire.com/about/a26373/community-guidelines/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/esqpolitics/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/esqpolitics/ </a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"esquire.com","author":"Stu Rohrer","date":"2018-07-20T14:06:39.192+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/esquire.com/"}}
