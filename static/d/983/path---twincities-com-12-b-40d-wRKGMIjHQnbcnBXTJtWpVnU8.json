Alden Global Capital, a New York-based hedge fund, has been the majority owner of Digital First Media since 2009. It received national attention in 2018 following major layoffs at The Denver Post that prompted the paper to run a special section criticizing ownership. Twincities.com revenue comes largely from advertising. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site includes breaking news, investigations, sports, entertainment, and features, as well as national and international news from The Associated Press. Twincities.com also publishes the newspaper’s editorials and political endorsements.</p>\n<p>The paper has endorsed candidates from both parties. In 2008, it endorsed Democrat Barack Obama for president, while in the race for a U.S. Senate seat, it backed the Republican incumbent, Norm Coleman. The newspaper stopped making endorsements ahead of the 2012 presidential election, but has returned to endorsing candidates in local races. In 2017 it endorsed Pat Harris, a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and former city councilman, for mayor in the non-partisan race (he lost to Melvin Carter III, also a DFL member).</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles on the site are fact-based. Ads are clearly labeled. The Pioneer Press has won the Pulitzer Prize three times, most recently in 2000 when sports reporter George Dohrmann was honored for coverage of academic fraud linked to the University of Minnesota basketball program. The site’s ownership has been criticized for severe cuts to the newsroom budget.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site provides email addresses and telephone numbers for senior editors and reporters. It posts a “newsroom reader advocate” number, where readers can leave a voicemail message outlining “issues or concerns” about the Pioneer Press or Twincities.com.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Pioneer Press is a merger of the Minnesota Pioneer,  which was founded in 1849, and the St. Paul Dispatch, which started in 1868. The newspaper, later named the Pioneer Press, was sold by a local publisher to Ridder Publications, which later became Knight Ridder, in 1923. The morning Press and the evening Dispatch merged in 1985 and became a morning-only daily in 1990. The site has been active since 1996.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEdith Honan\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/05/newsonomics-alden-global-capital-is-making-so-much-money-wrecking-local-journalism-it-might-not-want-to-stop-anytime-soon/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/05/newsonomics-alden-global-capital-is-making-so-much-money-wrecking-local-journalism-it-might-not-want-to-stop-anytime-soon/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2018/04/06/as-vultures-circle-the-denver-post-must-be-saved/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.denverpost.com/2018/04/06/as-vultures-circle-the-denver-post-must-be-saved/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/editorial-barack-obama-for-president/33243864/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.startribune.com/editorial-barack-obama-for-president/33243864/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/editorial-norm-coleman-for-senate/33243874/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.startribune.com/editorial-norm-coleman-for-senate/33243874/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/george-dohrmann\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/george-dohrmann</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/braublog/2012/10/why-st-paul-pioneer-press-dropped-political-endorsements\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.minnpost.com/braublog/2012/10/why-st-paul-pioneer-press-dropped-political-endorsements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www2.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00530.xml\" target=\"_blank\">http://www2.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00530.xml</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/braublog/2012/10/why-st-paul-pioneer-press-dropped-political-endorsements\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.minnpost.com/braublog/2012/10/why-st-paul-pioneer-press-dropped-political-endorsements</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"twincities.com","author":"Edith Honan","date":"2018-09-14T16:37:22.799+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/twincities.com/"}}
