Investors include Maveron, a Seattle based venture capital firm. It has formed editorial partnerships with CNN’s “Reliable Sources” and public radio station KPCC in Pasadena, California.</p>\n<p>The site features advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Thewrap.com publishes news related to entertainment and media, focusing on movies, television, music, award shows, and celebrities. It also covers the gaming and tech industries. Articles range from serious topics and social issues, such as a September 2018 article titled “#AfterMeToo: 12 Accusers Share What Happened Next, From Firing to More Trauma,” to lighthearted entertainment pieces, such as a September 2018 article titled “‘Blue’s Clues’ Found a New Host – and Steve’s Cool With It.” Many articles report on new movies and television episodes in the form of reviews or summaries.  The website publishes special issues, such as CollegeWrap, which focuses on stories related to college and college students, and both OscarWrap and EmmyWrap on the famous awards shows.</p>\n<p>A clearly-labeled column, “Waxword,” features opinion pieces by Sharon Waxman, the publication’s editor, focusing on entertainment, politics, and social issues. The bio for the column describes itself as “Sharon Waxman's take on life on the left coast, high culture, low culture and the business of entertainment and media.” Waxman criticized President Trump in a June 2018 piece titled “The Unbearable Darkness of Trump – South of the Border Edition.” She has called Attorney General Jeff Sessions “Captain Evil.” Another section features articles and reviews by film critic Steve Pond, described in the bio for the column as the “awards editor at TheWrap.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Thewrap.com publishes reliable information and cites sources. Columns such as Waxword are marked as featuring opinion articles. Corrections and updates are published and dated at the top of articles. The site’s opinion columns are clearly labeled and separated from general news content.</p>\n<p>The site does not have a stated corrections policy, but a general contact form on the site’s Contact page allows readers to submit corrections by selecting the “Corrections” option. In a call with NewsGuard, a member of thewrap.com’s staff stated that when the publication receives emails or calls with correction requests, it makes the correction if warranted. NewsGuard was unable to find recent examples of a correction.</p>\n<p>In February 2011, Mail.com Media Corporation, the parent company of entertainment news site Deadline.com, accused The Wrap of “misappropriating content from Deadline.com, publishing that information on Thewrap.com, passing off that information as its own, and doing so without compensating or even crediting Deadline.com.” Waxman responded in her column with a piece titled “Party Pooper: Deadline Sends Cease and Desist Letter to TheWrap.” She wrote that Deadline.com gave no examples of Thewrap.com misappropriating content, and published the entirety of Deadline’s cease and desist letter. Soon after, she released a letter sent from thewrap.com’s lawyer to MMC’s lawyers, stating MMC’s accusations are “false” and “defamatory.” In 2013, The Wrap reported that Deadline had fired its founder in a piece titled “SHOCKER: Jay Penske Fires Nikki Finke From Deadline Hollywood.” Deadline responded by denying that Finke was fired, stating, “It is sad when a rival business feels the need to fabricate stories to create traffic and notoriety.” The Wrap article cited several unnamed sources and included Penske’s and Finke’s comments and denial of the firing. Finke departed from Deadline several months later.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site lists biographical and contact information for editorial staff and contributors, as well as video and advertising teams. Articles include an author’s contact information. The About Us page discloses ownership and financial information, and lists the awards it has won. Advertising is clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Waxman, a veteran journalist who has worked for The Washington Post, Chicago Tribune and The New York TImes, founded thewrap.com in 2009. In 2010 the site formed partnerships with CNN and KPCC, and secured $2 million in outside investment. In 2018, Thewrap.com acquired a digital membership and subscription service company, VideoInk Inc., and announced it would begin offering subscriptions to Thewrap.com for access to selected features.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nKat Harling\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
