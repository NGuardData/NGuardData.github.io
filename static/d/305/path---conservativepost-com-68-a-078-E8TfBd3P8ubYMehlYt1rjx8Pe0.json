However, its Facebook page says the site is based in Dallas, Texas. Texas business records show a Conservative Post LLC was registered in Dallas in 2013, the same year the site was launched. </p>\n<p>Those records showed Conservative Post LLC was registered by Rob Saunders, who is also listed as the company manager. Business records show Saunders is associated with Freedom Publishing LLC, Texas Freedom Publishing LLC, and RobSaunders.com Movies LLC, all of which share an address with Conservative Post LLC. As of October 2018, websites associated with those businesses and Saunders, including RobSaunders.com, are no longer online, except for ConservativePost.com. An archived version of RobSaunders.com’s About Rob page says that Rob is a “successful businessman and investor based in Dallas, Texas.”</p>\n<p>ConservativePost.com did not respond to messages NewsGuard sent through its messaging portal seeking information about the site’s ownership. Saunders did not respond to messages sent through Facebook and Linkedin.com seeking information about ConservativePost.com.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The website publishes stories about politics, religion, and current events from a conservative perspective and often includes false or misleading information. Stories are by anonymous authors, credited to “Report” or “RRJ,” and exhibit no original reporting. Stories can be a few sentences of commentary, sometimes comprised of insulting language about Democrats and liberals (“New Study Confirms 16.4 Million American Are Total Morons and They Vote Dem”) attached to reporting from other outlets.</p>\n<p>Sections include Politics, Culture, Entertainment, Faith, and Endtimes, a section which includes stories about events the site implies could be harbingers of the end of the world as described by biblical prophecy. Examples include “Trump’s Christmas Gift to Israel -- Is It a Fulfillment of Prophecy?” and “End Times? Massive Stone Topples From Jerusalem’s Temple Mount.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Conservative Post gathers and presents information irresponsibly and publishes false information. For example, in 2017 the site published a story titled “Trump’s Pedophile HUNTING RAIDS Just Busted 474 more Demons Putting ELITE IN ALL OUT PANIC...THEY’RE NEXT!” The story contains no links and does not provide evidence or citations for its false claims, including “the Trump administration has arrested more than 3,000 pedophiles in the two (sic) months” and that, by comparison, “the entire last year of Obama’s presidency only 400 low-level pedophiles were arrested.” The story did not explain the source of the numbers, but it appeared related to a debunked Townhall.com opinion column titled “Why the MSM Is Ignoring Trump's Sex Trafficking Busts.”</p>\n<p>As demonstrated by Elizabeth Nolan Brown, a writer at the libertarian Reason.com, Townhall.com used data pulled from just 26 states to determine that just “400 low-level pedophiles” were arrested under Obama in 2014.</p>\n<p>The Conservative Post story also claimed, without evidence, that the arrests of child sex traffickers were “just the beginning of what is coming” and “What’s to come is likely to ensnare many of those at the highest levels of government.” The implication that Trump is moving to purge the highest levels of government of pedophiles is a central tenet of the Qanon conspiracy theory, which holds that an anonymous poster on the 4chan website is a high-level government employee providing clues about a coming purge of a purported globalist pedophile elite.</p>\n<p>Conservative Post reports on stories from non-credible sources. The site regularly links to The Gateway Pundit, a conspiracy site. It has plagiarized content from other sites. A October 2018 story titled “Sharia Alert: Women Arrested for Dancing in Public” was a word-for-word copy of a post from IsraelToday.co.il titled “Palestinian Police Hunt Down and Arrest Young Women for Dancing in Public.”</p>\n<p>The site publishes misleading headlines. In May 2017 the site ran a headline titled “MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY Just ‘CAME OUT OF THE CLOSET’, But Will It HURT His Career?” The headline implied that McConaughey, an Oscar-winning actor, had come out as homosexual. But the attached story was about a recent interview he had given in which he demonstrated that he and his wife “take the sacred institution of marriage very seriously,” according to Conservative Post.</p>\n<p>Another headline titled “After 10 years, the Truth About Barack Obama Goes Finally Public” was about text messages between FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page in 2016 that related to the Trump campaign. They had nothing to do with Obama. Other misleading and sensationalist headlines included “Alert: China Makes Shock Announcement About War With America,” and “Look What Was Spotted Flying Over Japan… Are We Headed For WORLD WAR III?”</p>\n<p>The site does not appear to issue corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site does not disclose information about its ownership or financing. It also does not disclose the names of its authors, or any other members of its editorial staff. Stories do not have publication dates.</p>\n<p>The “Contact” page provides a form to message the site. The site did not respond to messages NewsGuard sent through the form with questions about the identity of the site’s ownership and editorial staff.</p>\n<p>Advertising is differentiated from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Conservative Post was registered as a website in 2013.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nJosh Keefe&#x26;emsp;Jim
