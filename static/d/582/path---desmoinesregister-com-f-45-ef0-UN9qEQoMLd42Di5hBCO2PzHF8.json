Those news sites make up the USA Today Network, which Gannett formed in 2015.</p>\n<p>Gannett publications generate revenue through advertisements and subscriptions for their printed publications, websites, and other digital products.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site publishes a variety of breaking news, news analysis, investigative reporting, and opinion pieces. The local news reporting touches on crime, government, politics, business, and culture. A national section runs content from other publications in the USA Today network of papers.</p>\n<p>The bottom of the home page includes a link to an Investigations tab, containing some of the Register’s more ambitious journalism. In 2018, for example, the Register ran a series of stories highlighting troubling behavior and decisions at a state agency, the Iowa Finance Authority. After the head of that agency was fired over what the paper described as “credible allegations of sexual harassment,” the Register reported that the terminated employee had been repeatedly warned by his top lieutenant about making lewd comments.</p>\n<p>The Register also shed light on a $17 million plan pushed by the same head of the finance agency to relocate its headquarters, despite a recommendation from a third-party analyst that the relocation would not save money.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Register produces balanced and well-sourced news with straight-forward headlines. The website includes an editorial policy shared by all papers in Gannett’s USA Today Network, which emphasizes a commitment to accuracy and details various safeguards to ensure it, including the prompt publication of corrections when needed.</p>\n<p>In addition to its team of editors, photographers, and sports reporters, the Register has approximately twenty reporters who focus on reporting or analyzing local and state news.</p>\n<p>The Register has been recognized with multiple awards for its journalism, including 17 Pulitzer Prizes, journalism highest honor. Most recently, editorial writer Andie Dominick  received a Pulitzer in 2018 for a series of articles examining the impact of Iowa’s privatization of its Medicaid program.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The Register’s website includes clear disclosures of its ownership by Gannett and provides detailed biographical and contact information for both newsroom leaders and content creators.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Register was founded in the mid-nineteenth century and became known for its editorial cartoons and as a pioneer in political polling. It has been owned by Gannett since 1985. The domain was registered in 1997.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJack Craver\n\nEdited by:\nKendrick McDonald&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://static.desmoinesregister.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">http://static.desmoinesregister.com/about/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/investigations/2018/06/04/dave-jamison-took-sex-harassment-prevention-training-just-prior-being-fired/669257002/&nbsp;(sexual\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/investigations/2018/06/04/dave-jamison-took-sex-harassment-prevention-training-just-prior-being-fired/669257002/ (sexual</a> harassment investigation)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/investigations/2018/04/29/dave-jamison-sexual-harrassmen-ifa-director-warned-lewd-comments-before-gov-reynolds-fired-him/559730002/&nbsp;(sexual\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/investigations/2018/04/29/dave-jamison-sexual-harrassmen-ifa-director-warned-lewd-comments-before-gov-reynolds-fired-him/559730002/ (sexual</a> harassment investigation)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/investigations/2018/06/01/iowa-finance-authority-sought-lease-termination-after-director-dave-jamison-fired-governor-reynolds/657778002/&nbsp;(IFA\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/investigations/2018/06/01/iowa-finance-authority-sought-lease-termination-after-director-dave-jamison-fired-governor-reynolds/657778002/ (IFA</a> investigation)</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/investigations/2018/04/25/iowa-finance-authority-mike-jamison-kim-reynolds-17-m-move-bell-av-hubbell-realty-michael-fitzgerald/547928002/&nbsp;(IFA\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/investigations/2018/04/25/iowa-finance-authority-mike-jamison-kim-reynolds-17-m-move-bell-av-hubbell-realty-michael-fitzgerald/547928002/ (IFA</a> investigation)</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cm.desmoinesregister.com/ethical-conduct\" target=\"_blank\">https://cm.desmoinesregister.com/ethical-conduct</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/development/2017/09/25/downtown-skyscraper-the-fifth-climbs-39-stories/698883001/&nbsp;(example\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/development/2017/09/25/downtown-skyscraper-the-fifth-climbs-39-stories/698883001/ (example</a> of corrected story)</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/thomas-j-knudson&nbsp;(Knudson\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/thomas-j-knudson (Knudson</a> Pulitzer)</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/contact/staff/#newsroom\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.desmoinesregister.com/contact/staff/#newsroom</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://static.desmoinesregister.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">http://static.desmoinesregister.com/about/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://static.desmoinesregister.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">http://static.desmoinesregister.com/about/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2015/06/19/history---des-moines-register/29000225/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2015/06/19/history---des-moines-register/29000225/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Des-Moines-Register\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Des-Moines-Register</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"desmoinesregister.com","author":"Jack Craver","date":"2018-08-15T21:13:08.479+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/desmoinesregister.com/"}}
