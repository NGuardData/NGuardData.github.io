Eleven local newspapers merged in 1998 to form the contemporary version of The Journal News.</p>\n<p>In December 2012, The Journal News published a story about the availability of information about gun ownership in the area. Lohud.com published an interactive map with the story, which used public records to pinpoint the locations of handgun permit holders and allowed readers to see their names and addresses. In response to threats and public outrage, the newspaper hired armed security guards and a few weeks later removed the database from its website.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nRachel Treisman\n\nEdited by:\nEric Effron&#x26;emsp;Yemile Bucay&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gannett.com/brands/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.gannett.com/brands/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://static.lohud.com/faq/\" target=\"_blank\">http://static.lohud.com/faq/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/westchester/2018/06/06/lauren-spierer-missing-indiana-university-student-disappeared-7-years-ago/676877002/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/westchester/2018/06/06/lauren-spierer-missing-indiana-university-student-disappeared-7-years-ago/676877002/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lohud.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lohud.com</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cm.lohud.com/ethical-conduct\" target=\"_blank\">https://cm.lohud.com/ethical-conduct</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lohud.com/story/sports/winter-olympics-2018/2018/02/17/ilya-kovalchuk-hockey-olympics-usa-russia/348011002/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lohud.com/story/sports/winter-olympics-2018/2018/02/17/ilya-kovalchuk-hockey-olympics-usa-russia/348011002/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lohud.com/story/money/careers/2017/08/04/10-of-the-top-nursing-programs-in-the-united-states/104160102/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lohud.com/story/money/careers/2017/08/04/10-of-the-top-nursing-programs-in-the-united-states/104160102/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lohud.com/story/money/business/economy/2017/12/01/nafta-agricultural-secretary-sonny-perdue-seeks-assure-arizona-farmers-phoenix-visit/913306001/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lohud.com/story/money/business/economy/2017/12/01/nafta-agricultural-secretary-sonny-perdue-seeks-assure-arizona-farmers-phoenix-visit/913306001/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lohud.com/contact/staff/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lohud.com/contact/staff/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://mediasolutions.lohud.com/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">http://mediasolutions.lohud.com/about-us/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Journal_News\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The<em>Journal</em>News</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/gun-map/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/gun-map/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"lohud.com","author":"Rachel Treisman","date":"2018-09-14T01:36:28.130+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/lohud.com/"}}
