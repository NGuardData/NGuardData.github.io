Fox was created in 1986 by Murdoch, who also runs another major media company, News Corp, and is publicly traded.   </p>\n<p>In June 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division approved a proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by the Walt Disney Company. After the acquisition, Fox Business will become part of a new, Murdoch-controlled company, New Fox.</p>\n<p>Fox Business operates out of the 21st Century Fox headquarters in New York, and has bureaus in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, and London. The site generates revenue through advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>FoxBusiness.com posts articles and video from Fox Business broadcasts, covering national politics and financial news. Stories tend to cover financial results and other announcements from major companies, policy decisions and how they will impact business, and advice on taxes, careers, and retirement. </p>\n<p>The site features original interviews and content, cites reporting from other news outlets, and publishes articles from wire services including The Associated Press. The Show Clips section of the site links to video.foxbusiness.com, where users can access clips and entire episodes of Fox Business shows and news programs.</p>\n<p>After years of trailing rival CNBC in viewership, the network has beat CNBC over the past few years, a change Business Insider and USA Today have attributed to an increase in political coverage on Fox Business. The site also publishes real-time stock quotes on its homepage and in its articles.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles exclusive to the website cite first-hand interviews and credible outside news organizations, including rival CNBC. Stories and headlines are typically balanced and accurate.</p>\n<p>Programs from the network, posted on the site, feature interviews and reporting by Fox Business hosts and journalists, including Neil Cavuto, Maria Bartiromo, and Lou Dobbs. In contrast to its sister channel Fox News, Fox Business hosts generally maintain an even-handed approach to President Trump, although Dobbs stands out for being openly and consistently supportive of President Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>The site appends updates to the bottom of articles explaining when a story has been corrected.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles on FoxBusiness.com often include the writer’s name, usually with links to the author’s photo and Twitter handle. Video clips from Fox Business Network broadcasts usually name the reporter and sometimes provide their Twitter handle on a banner within the clip. The Anchors and Reporters page names the members of Fox Business Network’s on-air staff, with biographies and photos for each.</p>\n<p>A page for each program on the network provides biographical information and sometimes social media handles for its hosts, as well as clips from recent broadcasts. A Media Relations link at the bottom of foxbusiness.com redirects to the network's press site, and also contains its leadership roster and contact information for press or user inquiries. </p>\n<p>Advertisements are distinguishable from editorial content.      </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Rupert Murdoch launched Fox Business Network through his media conglomerate, News Corporation, in October 2007. Fox Business became the third network to focus on business and financial news, joining CNBC and Bloomberg Television. News Corporation split into News Corp and 21st Century Fox, the site’s current parent, in 2013.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n\nEdited by:\nJim Warren&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/about-us\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.foxbusiness.com/about-us</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.21cf.com/investor-relations/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.21cf.com/investor-relations/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/06/27/624075667/justice-department-disney-can-buy-21st-century-fox-but-with-one-caveat\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.npr.org/2018/06/27/624075667/justice-department-disney-can-buy-21st-century-fox-but-with-one-caveat</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/past-corrections-drops-of-10-percent-or-more-in-the-sp-500\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/past-corrections-drops-of-10-percent-or-more-in-the-sp-500</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/10/13/fox-business-network-rides-politics-and-punch-ratings-success-fight-cnbc/753711001/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/10/13/fox-business-network-rides-politics-and-punch-ratings-success-fight-cnbc/753711001/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/fox-business-beating-cnbc-embracing-politics-2017-10\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.businessinsider.com/fox-business-beating-cnbc-embracing-politics-2017-10</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2013/06/24/fox-analyst-charles-payne-was-paid-to-push-now/194562\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2013/06/24/fox-analyst-charles-payne-was-paid-to-push-now/194562</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/about\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mediamatters.org/about</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-shouldnt-deal-with-the-democrats-on-immigration-dobbs\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-shouldnt-deal-with-the-democrats-on-immigration-dobbs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2018/01/25/sinister-pro-trump-propaganda-lou-dobbs/219153\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2018/01/25/sinister-pro-trump-propaganda-lou-dobbs/219153</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/business/30leonhardt.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/business/30leonhardt.html</a></li>\n<li>Correction <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/trump-tariffs-could-cancel-out-tax-cut-benefits-for-this-distillery\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/trump-tariffs-could-cancel-out-tax-cut-benefits-for-this-distillery</a></li>\n<li>\n<p>Correction <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/boeings-dreamliner-engine-maker-is-cutting-4600-jobs\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/boeings-dreamliner-engine-maker-is-cutting-4600-jobs</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/shows\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.foxbusiness.com/shows</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/shows/cavuto-coast-to-coast\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.foxbusiness.com/shows/cavuto-coast-to-coast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/personalities\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.foxbusiness.com/personalities</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://press.foxbusiness.com/corporate-info/\" target=\"_blank\">http://press.foxbusiness.com/corporate-info/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/person/d/brittany-de-lea\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.foxbusiness.com/person/d/brittany-de-lea</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/12/business/media/12fox.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/12/business/media/12fox.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-news-corp-board-approves-company-split-28-20130524-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-news-corp-board-approves-company-split-28-20130524-story.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"foxbusiness.com","author":"Sarah Brandt","date":"2018-11-15T22:30:34.302+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/foxbusiness.com/"}}
