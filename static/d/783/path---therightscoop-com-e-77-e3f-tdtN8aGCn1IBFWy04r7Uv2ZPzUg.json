Brian Sutton was identified as “the blogger otherwise known as ‘Right Scoop’” by The Daily Caller in 2015. Pictures from conservative blog theothermccain.com documenting Blogcon 2010, a conservative blogger convention, identified “Brian Sutton of The Right Scoop,” in a photo. </p>\n<p>The site runs ads.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site publishes short news opinion posts on breaking news, mostly on U.S. politics, from credible news sources, including The Washington Post, USA Today, Time, and NBC News, as well as verified social media accounts. Some stories are almost entirely a collection of tweets, with just a few dozen words of added commentary. One author publishes a dozen or more pieces a day -- and often several breaking updates on the same story. A second author also files posts on the site. Both use pseudonyms. Breathless headlines, all with exclamation points and capital letters, convey the news as if it is shocking or the cause of controversy. The stories are supportive of Republicans and the Trump administration and critical of Democrats and “liberals.” </p>\n<p>The Right Scoop also hosts a Twitter feed its calls Breaking News on its homepage, which includes accounts representing major news organizations from across the political spectrum and the world, such as Fox News, Times of India, Splinter News, NPR, and The Economist.</p>\n<p>While the site is conservative, and generally supports Republicans and criticizes Democrats, it is not hyperpartisan like many similarly oriented political blogs. The site regularly ran content critical of then candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election, and also occasionally criticized Trump and Republicans in 2018. For example, a widely reported story about Trump accusing a reporter of “never thinking” at a Rose Garden press conference was described as “totally rude and uncalled for. … Trump owes her an apology.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>TheRightScoop.com does not generally conduct reporting or seek comment from sources that are the subjects of its posts. But the site generally cites credible sources and does not misrepresent or distort facts in stories. Posts are regularly updated as new information becomes available.</p>\n<p>While the site has issued many corrections since its inception in 2009, NewsGuard could not find examples of corrections run in 2017 or 2018. Two emails sent to The Right Scoop seeking examples of corrections run in 2017 or 2018 was not returned. </p>\n<p>Content is not labeled news or opinion, and stories generally are a mix of the two. The site’s authors often insult people they disagree with, in both headlines and stories. For example, an October 5, 2018, story on the Supreme Court confirmation process for Brett Kavanaugh was titled “RIDICULOUS Murkowski explains why she will vote NO on confirming Kavanaugh!!” and called Murkowski “This dumb stupid...senator.” A story published on October 4, 2018, with the headline “Hilarious! Orrin Hatch TRIGGERS the heck out of anti-Kavanaugh protesters when the tells them to GROW UP!” (sic) called protesters “raving loons” who sound “like a bunch of cackling chickens.” Another October story about CNN’s coverage of the Kavanaugh protest called the cable station “just the gutter for news” and called CNN anchors Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon “idiots” while also referring to Cuomo as “Coo Coo Cuomo” and Lemon as “D Lemon.”</p>\n<p>Most headlines are hyperbolic and ascribe opinions to people or groups that are not backed up in the story. October 2018 examples include “WATCH: Grassley BREATHS FIRE at Schumer for trying to destroy Kavanaugh!”and “BREAKING: Kavanaugh Sworn in, Liberals are going Insane …”</p>\n<p>Because of the site’s pointed opinion and hyperbolic language in headlines and stories,  NewsGuard has determined TheRightScoop.com does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly or avoid deceptive headlines. Two emails to TheRightScoop.com seeking comment on its opinionated approach in content and headlines were not returned. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site offers no information on its two main bloggers, identified only as SooperMexican and The Right Scoop. There is no About Us page and no disclosure of ownership. Two emails seeking information on the site’s ownership and the identities of its editorial staff were not returned.</p>\n<p>The site offers an email address for submitting “tips” on its Contact Us page, with the message, “We’d love to hear from you. Please send us any suggestions or feedback using our email address below.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site began publishing in 2009.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nDan Cook\n\nEdited
