Lee Enterprises’ newspapers generate revenue from advertising and subscriptions to their printed and digital editions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Magicvalley.com reporters cover local news, including crime, government, and education. The site also covers local sports and entertainment and has sections for obituaries and opinion. The site publishes syndicated news content from local outlets such as the Idaho Statesman, national and international outlets like The Associated Press and CNN, as well as third-party content providers.</p>\n<p>The site is named after the Magic Valley region, which is located in southern Idaho.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Magicvalley.com reporters conduct original reporting, although the site does not generally feature in-depth reporting. Most stories written by Times-News staff seem to be coverage of government announcements and meetings or local crime.</p>\n<p>Magicvalley.com regularly publishes corrections, either as a “correction” or a “clarification” at the bottom of articles. Headlines on Magicvalley.com clearly reflect the content of articles and are not sensationalized. The site clearly distinguishes between news and opinion, with a separate opinion section that includes editorials, letters to the editor, and opinion columns.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Names and contact information for editors and newsroom staff are published in a staff listing. Articles by Times-News staff are bylined with author names and contact information. The site clearly states in its About Us section that it is owned by Lee Enterprises. Advertisements are clearly differentiated from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Times-News began in 1904 as the Twin Falls News. In 1942, the paper adopted its current name, the Times-News. It launched its first website in 1997, according to the site’s About page.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nLillian Childress\n\nEdited by:\nJosh Keefe&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://lee.net/about/\" target=\"_blank\">http://lee.net/about/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://magicvalley.com/news/local/education/statewide-nonprofit-will-help-launch-preschools-in-the-magic-valley/article_b1bd19a8-09c6-59a6-8c0a-7d651c7e3922.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://magicvalley.com/news/local/education/statewide-nonprofit-will-help-launch-preschools-in-the-magic-valley/article_b1bd19a8-09c6-59a6-8c0a-7d651c7e3922.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://magicvalley.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/september-crime-report-steak-eating-burglar-gas-can-explosion-counterfeit/collection_0e8fcee3-5a26-518d-820e-d22908a15f0f.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://magicvalley.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/september-crime-report-steak-eating-burglar-gas-can-explosion-counterfeit/collection_0e8fcee3-5a26-518d-820e-d22908a15f0f.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://magicvalley.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/district-candidates-debate-education-health-care-public-lands/article_cb598b5f-dc45-5dd2-99a5-02134e297452.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://magicvalley.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/district-candidates-debate-education-health-care-public-lands/article_cb598b5f-dc45-5dd2-99a5-02134e297452.html</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://magicvalley.com/sports/high-school/local-roundup-cutthroats-hold-off-bliss-for-district-title/article_6f6fa3d5-3d3e-51e7-a6eb-a3fd8a6947ae.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://magicvalley.com/sports/high-school/local-roundup-cutthroats-hold-off-bliss-for-district-title/article_6f6fa3d5-3d3e-51e7-a6eb-a3fd8a6947ae.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://magicvalley.com/sports/high-school/times-news-prep-athletes-of-the-week-april--april/article_41c3f6af-4834-56c5-97d0-5410f1ee8aa7.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://magicvalley.com/sports/high-school/times-news-prep-athletes-of-the-week-april--april/article_41c3f6af-4834-56c5-97d0-5410f1ee8aa7.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://magicvalley.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/police-unhappy-client-punches-threatens-to-kill-man-downtown/article_2d9a4905-2716-51be-bb64-cb75631f30a7.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://magicvalley.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/police-unhappy-client-punches-threatens-to-kill-man-downtown/article_2d9a4905-2716-51be-bb64-cb75631f30a7.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://magicvalley.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/prosecutor-boys-in-fawnbrook-case-plead-guilty/article_d1aa1b3c-1b69-553f-bab4-ac56d4206392.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://magicvalley.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/prosecutor-boys-in-fawnbrook-case-plead-guilty/article_d1aa1b3c-1b69-553f-bab4-ac56d4206392.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://magicvalley.com/opinion/#tracking-source=menu-nav\" target=\"_blank\">https://magicvalley.com/opinion/#tracking-source=menu-nav</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://magicvalley.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/district-candidates-debate-education-health-care-public-lands/article_cb598b5f-dc45-5dd2-99a5-02134e297452.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://magicvalley.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/district-candidates-debate-education-health-care-public-lands/article_cb598b5f-dc45-5dd2-99a5-02134e297452.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://magicvalley.com/news/local/blaine-county-receives-fire-mitigation-project-grant/article_9a981162-f5ad-58bb-b77d-1007f736d926.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://magicvalley.com/news/local/blaine-county-receives-fire-mitigation-project-grant/article_9a981162-f5ad-58bb-b77d-1007f736d926.html</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://magicvalley.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/a-woman-said-a-twin-falls-man-swung-knives-at/article_52f44f44-f439-5228-ab51-9e88a8350f84.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://magicvalley.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/a-woman-said-a-twin-falls-man-swung-knives-at/article_52f44f44-f439-5228-ab51-9e88a8350f84.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://magicvalley.com/contact/staff/\" target=\"_blank\">https://magicvalley.com/contact/staff/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://magicvalley.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">https://magicvalley.com/about/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://magicvalley.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">https://magicvalley.com/about/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"magicvalley.com","author":"Lillian Childress","date":"2018-10-17T21:44:51.843+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/magicvalley.com/"}}
