It diverges often in subject matter and tone from the opinion-driven evening programs associated with former longtime Fox News mainstay Bill O’Reilly and now the hosts Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, and Laura Ingraham.</p>\n<p>Foxnews.com offers breaking, political, and entertainment news, live video of major events, and both news and features on the environment, science, technology, sports, weather, and health. It resembles the more traditional news coverage found on Fox News Channel during much of the network’s morning and afternoon programs, including shows hosted by Shepard Smith and Bret Baier.</p>\n<p>Stories rarely mentioned on Fox News Channel receive attention online, such as those in a “Planet Earth” section that acknowledge the devastating impacts of climate change. Typical was the section’s story on July 25, 2018, which was re-published from Space.com and opened, “It's no secret that human activity is changing the climate, and one new study shows how our influence is seriously affecting Earth's seasons and atmosphere.” Two weeks earlier, the section’s story from The Associated Press disclosed how the European Space Agency released an image of a four-mile-long iceberg breaking away from a glacier in Greenland. The scientific consensus on climate change is often derided by Hannity, Carlson, and other Fox commentators. And while Foxnews.com links to the pages of individual shows, it does not highlight and market them. The strategy reflects a view that breaking news is more attractive than opinion to a digital audience, according to three current or former Fox staffers who spoke to NewsGuard.</p>\n<p>While less ideological than Fox News Channel’s prime time shows, the website is distinct from the sites of cable rivals MSNBC and CNN. In particular, Foxnews.com is far more sympathetic to President Trump, especially on issues such as alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and alleged collusion with the Trump campaign. It gives less play to those allegations than do its rivals, three current and former staffers told NewsGuard, adding that the editorial thrust reflects a view that Fox competitors overplay negative stories to malign Trump. As does the cable channel, the website airs live Trump political rallies far more often than its competitors, according to a quantitative analysis by Media Matters, a Trump critic. Even when publishing straightforward news, the site will underscore suspicions about what it deems “liberal” media views on a subject. For example, when FBI agent Peter Strzok, who was accused of letting anti-Trump personal opinions interfere with his oversight of the Russia investigation, testified before Congress on July 12, 2018, the website story opened with straightforward reference to Democrats and Republicans clashing during the rancorous hearing. But it quickly noted how Strzok defended “those infamous messages,” a reference to disputed text messages he sent to a senior FBI attorney. The Justice Department’s inspector general found no evidence that his personal views swayed his performance. “Our review did not find documentary or testimonial evidence directly connecting the political views these employees expressed in their text messages and instant messages to the investigative decisions we reviewed,” the IG report states.</p>\n<p>Criticisms of Trump administration immigration policy are rare, with the clear implication that the “mainstream” media are unduly negative toward the changes. Thus, while USA Today heralded a Time magazine cover that superimposed Trump hovering over what USA Today called the “iconic” photograph of a crying Honduran girl (“Welcome to America” was the Time headline), Foxnews.com wrote, “A misleading Time magazine cover of President Trump looming over a crying migrant girl has exemplified the media’s eagerness to portray the administration’s immigration policies in the harshest possible light.”</p>\n<p>Negative opinion columns about Democrats and other media are plentiful. Its main page on July 25, 2018, included “DAVID BOSSIE: Trump beat Hillary more than a year ago but the left can't let it go -- and it's harming our country;” “Newt Gingrich: Democrats’ latest election strategy? They aim to win by allowing non-citizens to vote;” “McEnany: GOP would welcome Hillary and her 'history of losing elections' to 2020 field;” “Unhinged' CNN star Jake Tapper belittled staff during angry outburst, report says;” and “'The View' stars Joy Behar, Meghan McCain clash over normalizing Democratic Socialism.”</p>\n<p>However, Trump does not go untarnished. Foxnews.com covered fully what it tagged the “bipartisan backlash” against his July 16, 2018, Helsinki, Finland, press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin. That included a story reporting that Neil Cavuto, an anchor and managing editor at Fox News and Fox Business Network, called Trump’s performance “disgusting.” Since it simulcasts Smith’s afternoon show, the site shows his frequent criticisms of Trump, including a retort to Trump’s assertion that Putin is not his enemy. “Russia is the enemy of the United States,” Smith said on July 12, 2018, immediately after airing a clip of Trump’s statement.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site runs corrections at the top or bottom of a story. However, the site makes it difficult to know how to seek one. The email of an executive overseeing corrections is only found in its Media Relations section, while there is an Email Newsroom link that gives a general email address for the newsroom. A Fox News spokeswoman, Caley Cronin, called the placement of the information “appropriate,” adding “we try to be fully transparent.” Cronin sent three examples of corrections. When asked for more examples and the number run over the past year, Fox did not offer examples or an estimate.</p>\n<p>Corrections posted on the site include a May 23, 2017, retraction of a story given substantial play on both the cable channel and website that linked a slain Democratic National Committee staffer, Seth Rich, to the leaking of DNC email to WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign. The Fox News cable channel helped to accelerate conspiracy theories about whether his killing and the leaks were related. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said on “Fox and Friends,” which is known to be Trump’s favorite morning news show, that Rich “apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments.” U.S. intelligence officials say that DNC servers were hacked by individuals acting at the Russian government’s direction. Fox did not apologize or explain what went wrong with the original story, which it removed from its site. The retraction indicated, “We will continue to investigate this story and will provide updates as warranted.” None has come.</p>\n<p>On July 3, 2018, the website ran a news story about federal prosecutors ending an investigation into a former congressional technology staffer, Imran Awan, by rejecting suggestions (what they called “public allegations”) that he was a Pakistani intelligence operative who stole equipment and information with cover from House Democrats. Those claims were repeatedly promoted by conservative media, including the Fox News cable channel, with Trump himself referring to Awan as “the Pakistani mystery man.” The investigation resulted in the plea agreement in which Awan admitted to making a false statement on a bank loan application. The website’s straight new story about the agreement ran under an opinion column, “Justice Department covers up possible spy ring scandal in Democratic congressional offices” that termed “an incredible sweetheart plea deal” an agreement overseen by a Trump-picked U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site includes brief identification of most reporters whose names are on stories. It does not have a list of staff or newsroom managers. It clearly differentiates between news and opinion, and clearly labels advertising. It only discloses its ownership by 21st Century Fox within the content found by clicking on a Terms of Use button at the bottom of the site. It does not link to any information about 21st Century Fox, including its control by conservative and Trump confidant Rupert Murdoch. The corporate information area of the site’s media relations link notes that Murdoch is the executive chairman but does not specify ownership.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>When Fox News launched on cable in 1996, Rupert Murdoch believed there was a market niche for a more conservative-leaning channel. He said he did not believe that ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN were objective sources of news. In a 2006 interview with Financial Times, he said Fox has \"given room to both sides, whereas only one side had it before.\" The growth of Fox underscores that he tapped into a large audience. However, the website was for many years short on resources and political influence within the organization, according to NewsGuard interviews with three current or former staffers. In part it was because Roger Ailes, the longtime chairman and chief executive of Fox News Channel, was skeptical of the internet and social media. Ailes told a University of North Carolina journalism school audience in 2012, “I’m from a school that is still trying to decide why I want to tell everyone when I’m going to the bathroom or buying a loaf of bread. I don’t think it’s all that interesting, nor is it anybody’s damn business, but apparently the next generation is really excited about that. So, we’re trying to figure out, is there money to be made there?”</p>\n<p>The cable news channel has always been far more financially important to the company than the website, which was started in the late 1990s. That was made clear by Ken LaCorte, the former senior vice president of Fox News Digital who ran the site between 2006 and 2016. He told NewsGuard the news channel’s profit dwarfed the website’s.</p>\n<p>In recent years, sexual harassment allegations convulsed the organization. Ailes left in 2016 amid allegations against him. O’Reilly, who for many years was the top-rated host in cable news, exited in 2017 after an internal investigation. However, Fox has continued its ratings dominance, and the organization’s political influence remains clear. Hannity is a close informal adviser to Trump, while longtime Ailes deputy Bill Shine, who was co-president of Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network, was named White House deputy chief of staff for communications in July 2018. He left Fox in 2017 amid criticisms of his role in handling the sexual harassment allegations.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJim Warren\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Gordon Crovitz&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/revenue-at-fox-news-cnn-and-msnbc-up-nearly-20-percent/331043\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/revenue-at-fox-news-cnn-and-msnbc-up-nearly-20-percent/331043</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/science/2018/07/25/climate-change-strengthens-earths-heartbeat-and-thats-bad-news.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.foxnews.com/science/2018/07/25/climate-change-strengthens-earths-heartbeat-and-thats-bad-news.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/06/21/time-cover-places-photo-crying-immigrant-child-trumps-feet/721315002/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/06/21/time-cover-places-photo-crying-immigrant-child-trumps-feet/721315002/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/06/22/time-cover-paints-trump-as-immigration-boogeyman-in-striking-contrast-with-obama-coverage.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/06/22/time-cover-paints-trump-as-immigration-boogeyman-in-striking-contrast-with-obama-coverage.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/16/trump-faces-bipartisan-criticism-over-press-conference-with-putin.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/16/trump-faces-bipartisan-criticism-over-press-conference-with-putin.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=neil+cavuto+calls+trump+press+conference+disgusting&oq=neil+cavuto+calls+trump+press+conference+disgusting&aqs=chrome..69i57.9913j1j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.google.com/search?q=neil+cavuto+calls+trump+press+conference+disgusting&#x26;oq=neil+cavuto+calls+trump+press+conference+disgusting&#x26;aqs=chrome..69i57.9913j1j4&#x26;sourceid=chrome&#x26;ie=UTF-8</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"foxnews.com","author":"Jim Warren","date":"2018-08-27T14:05:46.399+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/foxnews.com/"}}
