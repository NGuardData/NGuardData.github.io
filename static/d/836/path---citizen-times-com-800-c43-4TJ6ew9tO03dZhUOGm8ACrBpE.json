Its publications have won numerous awards, including three Pulitzer Prizes in 2018.</p>\n<p>Gannett also owns Newsquest, a company of more than 165 newspaper brands and 40 magazines in the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p>In the U.S. and the U.K., Gannett generates revenue through advertisements and subscriptions for its printed publications, websites, and other digital products. Users must purchase digital subscriptions to access unlimited content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Citizen-times.com publishes local news on politics, business, sports, and other topics affecting Asheville, North Carolina, and surrounding parts of western North Carolina and the Blue Ridge Mountains. Typical news stories cover state rulings on business deals in the area, an interstate development project, bad weather, and bear sightings in back yards. The site has a feature called “Answer Man,” where a columnist responds to offbeat readers’ questions, and a blog called “Girl Gone Outdoors.” Some national news stories come from USA Today and The Associated Press.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Citizen Times publishes local news that is generally reliable, thorough, and  accurate, citing reputable sources such as the state Department of Transportation. Headlines are typically clear and fact-based.</p>\n<p>The Citizen-Times won three first-place awards and five second-place awards in 2017 from the North Carolina Press Association, including a first-place award for best community coverage, and a features award for a profile of a local sheriff.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of its homepage, the site provides a link to page that lists the publication’s “ethical principles.” The page includes a detailed list of the site’s values under five major categories: seeking and reporting the truth, serving the public interest, maintaining fairness, maintaining independence, and acting with integrity. The site regularly publishes corrections, usually at the top of stories, describing what information in the story has been changed.</p>\n<p>The website publishes opinion columns, editorials, and letters to the editor in a separately labeled section.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>At the bottom of its homepage, the website provides a link to a Contact page that lists the names, phone numbers, and email addresses of its staff members, including the editors in charge. A Follow Our Staff page includes the same information for its journalists.</p>\n<p>Stories generally name their author and link to an archive of their work, and sometimes provide biographical information.</p>\n<p>The site’s homepage states that the website is part of the USA Today network, but does not clearly disclose its ownership by Gannett. Manny Garcia, ethics and standards editor for the USA Today Network, told NewsGuard that while Gannett is the network’s company name, “our audiences, consumers and advertisers understand that our strength lies in the USA Today Network and our 109 sites, plus USA Today. It is the power of local to national and vice-versa.”</p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguishable from editorial content. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The newspaper was founded in
