In September 2018, Meredith announced the sale of Time magazine to Salesforce.com founder and chairman Marc Benioff and his wife, Lynne, for $190 million. </p>\n<p>Benioff, who is worth $6.7 billion according to Forbes, said he planned to support the magazine financially but will not interfere in editorial decision making. “Lynne and I will take on no operational responsibility for Time, and look only to be stewards of this historic and iconic brand with all of us,” Benioff said in a statement posted on Time.com.</p>\n<p>Time earns revenue through advertisements and sponsored content, subscriptions, and by selling reprints of its covers.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site includes deeply reported stories that appear in the magazine’s print edition, as well as web-only content, such as a breaking news section called The Brief. Its sections include U.S. and world news, politics, entertainment, health, technology and Ideas.</p>\n<p>Time chooses influencers and leaders for its annual “Person of the Year” issue. The “Time 100” is an annual list highlighting the magazine’s picks for the 100 most influential people in the world.</p>\n<p>The site sometimes posts live video of breaking news and prominently features its columnists and reporters explaining the major news of the week. The site also includes breaking national and international news from The Associated Press and several special sections, including one focusing on Time’s history and another on the magazine’s photography.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site and magazine are known for exclusive cover stories, including several on the early days of Donald Trump’s administration in 2017, iconic cover photos, first-person accounts, and newly published book excerpts. Articles typically identify sources for content, which include first-hand interviews and official documents. Headlines are fact-based and accurate.</p>\n<p>Time.com publishes corrections to its articles. Opinionated content is clearly marked and published separate from news coverage.</p>\n<p>In 2012, Time won “Magazine of the Year” at the National Magazine Awards -- one of the most prestigious awards for U.S. magazines. In 2018, the magazine won the National Magazine Award in the video category for “Life After Addition,” produced in collaboration with news and culture site Mic.com.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Time.com articles name the author, which link to an archive of the writer’s work. Individual author email addresses are included at the bottom of stories.</p>\n<p>Memos from Time’s top editor, Edward Felsenthal, are included in the Press Room section, but the outlet’s leadership is not disclosed in sections that readers typically use to learn about the site, and no biographical or contact information is provided. In early October 2018, before the sale to the Benioffs was completed, references to Meredith’s ownership and information about top editors were included in a media kit aimed at advertisers, but were not clearly disclosed on Time.com. However, the Benioffs’ purchase of Time was announced in the Press Room section.</p>\n<p>Advertisements and other third-party content are clearly distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<p>Asked about Time.com’s disclosures regarding site leadership and content creators, Kristin Matzen, director of communications for Time, told NewsGuard: “Time is entering a period of transition from our previous owner Meredith, which will allow us to prioritize making these changes to our website.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Henry Luce launched the weekly magazine in 1923 with his Yale classmate, Briton Hadden, making it the first weekly newsmagazine in the United States. Newsweek was founded by a former Time editor a decade later and the publications became the model for other weekly newsmagazines.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This Nutrition Label was updated to reflect the fact that Time.com has added information about its content creators and now meets NewsGuard’s standard for that criteria.</em></p>\n<p><em>Disclosure:</em><em> NewsGuard co-CEO Steven Brill has written several freelance feature articles for Time. Richard Stengel, a member of NewsGuard’s advisory board, was a former senior writer and managing editor of Time.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEdith Honan\n\nEdited by:\nAmy
