{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<div class=\"right-score\">Score: 0</div>\n<h1>clickhole.com&emsp; <span class=\"net-country\">(WEB - en-US)</span></h1>\n<p>A satirical news website that publishes deliberately false content to mock “clickbait” websites. It was created by the team behind TheOnion.com, a well-known satirical news site.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<p>Clickhole.com is owned by Gizmodo Media Group LLC, an online media company that publishes news sites Jezebel.com, Deadspin.com, Splinter.com, and TheRoot.com. Gizmodo is a subsidiary of Univision Communications Inc., a private multimedia company, and is operated by its Fusion Media Group division. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Clickhole.com publishes humorous fake news, usually with intentionally outrageous headlines modeled after a viral style popularized by sites like Buzzfeed and Upworthy. Examples include “Heartwarming: When This Kid Was Eating Lunch Alone, His Classmates Summoned The Devil To Sit With Him,” and “6 Things ‘Titanic’ Got Wrong About Letting A Poor Person Draw You Naked.”</p>\n<p>Clickhole.com divides its content into several categories: Lifestyle, News, Voices, Quizzes, Clickventures (interactive “Choose Your Own Adventure” style text-based content), ResistanceHole (a parody of anti-Donald Trump websites) and PatriotHole (a parody of conservative websites).</p>\n<p>Clickhole also publishes parody and joke videos, such as “Beautiful: Cobra Honors The Troops,” featuring a 30-second closeup of a Cobra’s head. Some of the videos also feature human actors, like “A Real Hassle: Woman Struggles To Drive All Three Cars Home After Shopping Spree At Car Dealership,” which shows a woman rotating between driving three cars a few inches at a time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Clickhole.com’s stated goal is to “make sure that all of our content panders to and misleads our readers just enough to make it go viral.” The site also warns visitors at the bottom of its home page that “ClickHole uses invented names in all of its stories, except in cases where public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.” In addition, the site says it is “not intended for readers under 18 years of age.”</p>\n<p>However, there have been instances of ClickHole.com content being mistaken for actual news stories. In 2014, The Washington Post gathered responses of Twitter users earnestly reacting to ClickHole.com articles. In response to a Clickhole article headlined “We Took an Israeli Child And A Palestinian Child And Put Them Together In The Same Room. And We’re Going to Keep Them,” one Twitter user commented on the unfairness of such a tack, writing, “It is not a child’s conflict.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Clickhole.com does not list the authors of individual pieces of content on its website, though it  list its editors and staff on its “About” page.  The site clearly labels advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Clickhole.com was launched in 2014 by Onion Inc., the media company behind the satirical newspaper The Onion and its companion website, TheOnion.com, as well as the news site AVclub.com. The company was formed by University of Wisconsin students who began publishing The Onion newspaper in the late 1980s. The private American media company Univision bought an undisclosed stake in Onion Inc. in 2016.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJosh Keefe\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/06/24/the-onion-launched-a-parody-site-called-clickhole-and-not-everyone-got-the-joke-what-happened-next-will-not-surprise-you/?utm_term=.c7ebd5b2f237\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/06/24/the-onion-launched-a-parody-site-called-clickhole-and-not-everyone-got-the-joke-what-happened-next-will-not-surprise-you/?utm_term=.c7ebd5b2f237</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/1999/01/08/onion-moves-internet/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.ew.com/article/1999/01/08/onion-moves-internet/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/19/463535648/area-satiric-publication-the-onion-sold-to-univision-seriously\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/19/463535648/area-satiric-publication-the-onion-sold-to-univision-seriously</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001640579/33c30cdc-3a0f-4861-a618-b194e63ca87a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001640579/33c30cdc-3a0f-4861-a618-b194e63ca87a.pdf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.univision.com/noticias/univision-makes-investment-in-the-onion\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.univision.com/noticias/univision-makes-investment-in-the-onion</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/news/kinja-publishing-system-heart-gawker-lives-under-univision\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.poynter.org/news/kinja-publishing-system-heart-gawker-lives-under-univision</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/06/inside-the-onions-new-click-bait-parody-clickhole-com.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.vulture.com/2014/06/inside-the-onions-new-click-bait-parody-clickhole-com.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wpr.org/founding-editor-onion-satirical-newspaper-shouldnt-be-compared-fake-news\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wpr.org/founding-editor-onion-satirical-newspaper-shouldnt-be-compared-fake-news</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"clickhole.com","author":"Josh Keefe","date":"2018-07-20T14:05:55.202+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/clickhole.com/"}}
