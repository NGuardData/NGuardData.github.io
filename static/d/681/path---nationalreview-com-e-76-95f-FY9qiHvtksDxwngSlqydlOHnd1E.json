The Institute’s mission statement on its tax filing says its goal is to “Expand the understanding of conservative principles and philosophy in society and culture.”</p>\n<p>The site derives revenue through advertisements, sponsored content, and reader donations. Users also have to pay a fee after reading a select number of articles a month.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>National Review articles feature a distinctive voice, complementing news coverage with commentary. The publication is up front about this blend of opinion and news, stating that “National Review was founded in 1955 by William F. Buckley Jr. as a magazine of conservative opinion. The magazine has since defined the modern conservative movement and enjoys the broadest allegiance among American conservatives.”</p>\n<p>Topics include Politics &#x26; Policy, Culture, White House, PC Culture, Immigration, and Economy &#x26; Business. The site also publishes several newsletters, such as “The G-File,” a “weekly must-read take on conservative politics and pop culture, delivered with personality and panache.”</p>\n<p>The Photos section features slideshows of news, sports, and cultural photographs, as well as cartoons. The Videos section publishes original National Review videos on politics, international events, business, and technology. The site also has a Podcast section, featuring over a dozen podcasts on U.S. politics, world events, culture, books, and business. The Magazine section publishes articles from the print magazine. Subscribers can download a PDF copy of the current issue and access an archive of magazine issues dating back to 2009. The site also links to a Games section.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site’s articles link to credible third-party sources. Headlines accurately reflect the content of articles. In presenting news alongside opinion, National Review writers are generally fair in their presentation and interpretation of information. With the arrival of candidate, and then-President Donald Trump, the National Review demonstrated anew that its mission was conservative advocacy, not support for one political party regardless of the party nominee’s principles or positions. Its writers sharply criticized Trump, even as he became the Republican nominee and ultimately was elected president in 2016.</p>\n<p>Although the National Review does not disclose a corrections policy, the site regularly publishes corrections, typically including notices that explain the error and how the story was changed.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles give the name of the writer, generally linking to biographical and contact information. The Authors page provides an alphabetical list of staff writers and contributors, also providing some biographical and contact information. The site also names its editorial team on a separate page, as well as the National Review’s publisher, chairman, founder, and patrons and benefactors.</p>\n<p>The Contact Us page provides general email addresses and phone numbers, a New York street address, and links to the National Review’s social media pages. An FAQ section clearly discloses the National Review’s ownership, and the site also provides a link to the National Review Institute website.</p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored content are distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Buckley’s 1955 mission statement explained: “[National Review] stands athwart history, yelling Stop, at a time when no one is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it. National Review is out of place, in the sense that the United Nations and the League of Women Voters and the New York Times and Henry Steele Commager are in place. It is out of place because, in its maturity, literate America rejected conservatism in favor of radical social experimentation … There are, thank Heaven, the exceptions. There are those of generous impulse and a sincere desire to encourage a responsible dissent from the Liberal orthodoxy. And there are those who recognize that when all is said and done, the market place depends for a license to operate freely on the men who issue licenses — on the politicians.”</p>\n<p>The magazine promoted the 1964 presidential candidacy of Barry Goldwater, and its heyday as an ascendant political force came with the election in 1980 of Ronald Reagan, a longtime subscriber. Before and during that time, the magazine and Buckley denounced segregationist Alabama governor George Wallace’s presidential campaigns. Buckley, who died in 2008, took the lead in separating anti-Semitic and far right groups, such as the John Birch Society, from his conservative movement.</p>\n<p>Over the years, the National Review has featured reporting and commentary from primarily conservative thinkers and writers, including Allan Bloom, Robert Bork, L. Brent Bozell, Jr., Whittaker Chambers, Ann Coulter, Milton Friedman, Charles Murray, Thomas Sowell, Mona Charen and Garry Wills.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This Nutrition Label and the criteria checklist have been updated to indicate that, upon further review, the site does regularly correct and clarify errors.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://nationalreview.fundraise.com/national-review\" target=\"_blank\">https://nationalreview.fundraise.com/national-review</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/newsletter-signup/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nationalreview.com/newsletter-signup/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://games.nationalreview.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://games.nationalreview.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/photos/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nationalreview.com/photos/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/videos/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nationalreview.com/videos/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nationalreview.com/podcasts/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/book-recommendations-for-summer-reading/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/book-recommendations-for-summer-reading/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/news/cnn-pipe-bomb-white-powder-harmless-law-enforcement-report/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nationalreview.com/news/cnn-pipe-bomb-white-powder-harmless-law-enforcement-report/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/news/dscc-chairman-welcomes-clintons-involvement-in-midterms/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nationalreview.com/news/dscc-chairman-welcomes-clintons-involvement-in-midterms/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/03/second-special-counsel-jeff-sessions-seriously-considering/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/03/second-special-counsel-jeff-sessions-seriously-considering/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/the-masthead/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nationalreview.com/the-masthead/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/contact-us/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nationalreview.com/contact-us/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2006/09/our-listless-universities-williumrex/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nationalreview.com/2006/09/our-listless-universities-williumrex/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tavis-smiley/my-conversation-with-garr_b_88813.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tavis-smiley/my-conversation-with-garr<em>b</em>88813.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"nationalreview.com","author":"Anna-Sophie Harling","date":"2018-11-08T16:36:43.453+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/nationalreview.com/"}}
