Its editor at large, Grant Stern, told NewsGuard in an email that the site was launched in 2017 by Omar and Rafael Rivero, twin brothers who founded Occupy Democrats, a group that promotes liberal Democrats and their causes. WashingtonPress.com runs ads and invites reader donations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Articles combine news from other sources, commentary on tweets, retweeted photos, and videos from other news outlets. The language is often sensational. The site has repeatedly referred to President Trump as “a frothing president” and has likened his public appearance to “a pre-World War II Bund rally.”</p>\n<p>The site borrows information, with attribution, from mainstream sources such as The Los Angeles Times, USA Today, and MSNBC. Videos run on the site and articles are rewritten by Washingtonpress.com writers. Some of the authors also write articles for the Occupy Democrats’ website, and the same articles may appear on both sites.   </p>\n<p>Although the site’s prime focus is politics and politicians, it also pays attention to entertainment figures, as it did when late night host Jimmy Kimmel needled the Trump family for selling merchandise made abroad. </p>\n<p>Articles reach far for opportunities to denounce the president. When a Muslim nurse was stabbed in an apparent hate crime in Texas, the site’s April 2018 article concluded, “With President Trump making America safe again for racists and hate-mongers to unashamedly express their passionate vitriol towards people that don’t look or think exactly as they do, expect to see a continuing rise in this type of crime until Trump and his ilk are removed from positions of power and influence. It can’t happen soon enough.”</p>\n<p>A July 2018 piece about a white man in Austin charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of a black teenager began, “The ugly racism that the Trump administration has unleashed reared its ugly head over the recent July 4th holiday.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site’s animus towards Trump permeates its coverage, as does its constant agitation for Trump’s impeachment.</p>\n<p>The same orientation is evident in the site’s choice of content and its misleading headlines. \"Reporters just uncovered a scandal that places Trump Tower fire death at Trump’s feet,\" read the headline on an April 2018 story about a fire in Manhattan's Trump Tower that took a resident’s life. The article noted, with attribution to USA Today, that the building was not legally required to have a sprinkler system.</p>\n<p>Occupy Democrats has been criticized by fact-checking organizations including Politifact and Snopes for exaggerating some stories and distorting others. For example, in June 2018, Occupy Democrats shared a photo of children in orange prison uniforms, implying in a caption they were detained immigrants. Snopes found, and NewsGuard independently confirmed, that the photo appeared with a 2014 article about comparative spending on prisons and schools.</p>\n<p>Corrections do not regularly appear on the website. Asked to provide examples of corrections, Stern sent only one correction that the site posted in April 2018, which involved a Financial Times article that the site had summarized that was subsequently corrected by the Financial Times.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site’s “Who We Are” page lists an email address for reader inquiries, but two NewsGuard queries went unanswered. Contact information, including photos, biographies and Twitter handles, is provided for most Washingtonpress.com writers, as are the titles of some editors.  The site does not include a list of staff members. </p>\n<p>Editors are not listed separately. The titles of some are included with their stories if they write for the site. Omar Rivero, the website’s editor in chief, is named as the author of some stories, but the site does not disclose that he is the top editor.</p>\n<p>Asked how the site distinguishes between fact and opinion, Stern said it does not run opinion pieces as such. Nevertheless most stories and headlines are highly opinionated.</p>\n<p>Two emails to Omar Rivero, one to his brother Rafael, and one to Colin Taylor, as well as a request of Stern that he ask Omar RIvero to talk with NewsGuard by email or phone to confirm Stern’s views of several issues -- the Washington Press’s corrections policy, how it distinguishes between fact and opinion, and who is in charge of the site -- were unsuccessful.  Washingtonpress.com invites readers to email with comments and questions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>WashingtonPress.com was founded in 2017 by Omar Rivero, according to Stern.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJoyce Purnick\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://washingtonpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://washingtonpress.com/ </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/are-children-orange-jumpsuits/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/are-children-orange-jumpsuits/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://washingtonpress.com/2018/03/15/trump-store-just-tried-to-insult-kimmel-over-scathing-segment-kimmels-response-is-epic/\" target=\"_blank\">https://washingtonpress.com/2018/03/15/trump-store-just-tried-to-insult-kimmel-over-scathing-segment-kimmels-response-is-epic/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://washingtonpress.com/2018/04/06/a-muslim-nurse-just-got-stabbed-in-a-heinous-houston-hate-crime-3/\" target=\"_blank\">https://washingtonpress.com/2018/04/06/a-muslim-nurse-just-got-stabbed-in-a-heinous-houston-hate-crime-3/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://washingtonpress.com/2018/06/23/trump-just-launched-a-vile-unprovoked-attack-on-john-mccain-at-nevada-rally-watch/\" target=\"_blank\">https://washingtonpress.com/2018/06/23/trump-just-launched-a-vile-unprovoked-attack-on-john-mccain-at-nevada-rally-watch/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://washingtonpress.com/2018/06/23/trump-just-abandoned-his-most-loyal-fans-with-a-devastating-move/\" target=\"_blank\">https://washingtonpress.com/2018/06/23/trump-just-abandoned-his-most-loyal-fans-with-a-devastating-move/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinnielongobardo\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinnielongobardo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://washingtonpress.com/author/grant/\" target=\"_blank\">https://washingtonpress.com/author/grant/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://washingtonpress.com/2018/07/06/a-white-man-just-got-charged-with-murder-for-killing-a-black-honor-roll-student-over-4th-of-july/\" target=\"_blank\">https://washingtonpress.com/2018/07/06/a-white-man-just-got-charged-with-murder-for-killing-a-black-honor-roll-student-over-4th-of-july/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://washingtonpress.com/2018/04/08/reporters-just-uncovered-a-scandal-that-places-trump-tower-fire-death-at-trumps-feet/\" target=\"_blank\">https://washingtonpress.com/2018/04/08/reporters-just-uncovered-a-scandal-that-places-trump-tower-fire-death-at-trumps-feet/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://washingtonpress.com/2018/02/10/federal-court-just-unsealed-trumps-20-year-old-dirty-secrets/\" target=\"_blank\">https://washingtonpress.com/2018/02/10/federal-court-just-unsealed-trumps-20-year-old-dirty-secrets/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://washingtonpress.com/2018/04/09/unsealed-court-records-just-revealed-whole-trump-family-faces-criminal-charges/\" target=\"_blank\">https://washingtonpress.com/2018/04/09/unsealed-court-records-just-revealed-whole-trump-family-faces-criminal-charges/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"washingtonpress.com","author":"Joyce Purnick","date":"2018-09-06T20:13:52.953+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/washingtonpress.com/"}}
