Google has blocked 8Chan from appearing in its search results because of its content.</p>\n<p>According to a February 2017 BuzzFeed News profile, Watkins is a U.S. Army veteran who launched a successful Japanese porn site in the late 1990s. He now lives in the Philippines, where he spends much of his time working on The Goldwater and tending to a pig farm,  BuzzFeed reported. He personally funds the website. Sponsored content also appears on the site.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Goldwater describes itself as “news for the working man” and publishes stories on topics ranging from U.S. politics to weird crimes, and numerous stories about child pornography and pedophilia. News is divided into categories including Caravan, Body Count, Science, PedoGate, and Weird. The site’s staff often writes commentary, and bases breaking news stories on the reporting of other outlets, such as TV affiliates or conservative sites such as Hannity.com.</p>\n<p>The Body Count section includes a multipart series alleging that former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were involved in numerous deaths, including those of celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and John F. Kennedy Jr. The PedoGate section, which reports on alleged pedophiles, also includes stories suggesting that there are pedophilic undertones in director Steven Spielberg’s films, and that Bill and Hillary Clinton are part of the NXIVM sex cult in New York state.  </p>\n<p>Its political articles offer favorable opinions of the Trump administration and criticize the mainstream media and figures such as special counsel Robert Mueller.</p>\n<p>Science and Weird stories report on alien encounters, UFO sightings, and stories about animals. For example, one story reported on a fungus called Massospora that drugs cicadas with the hallucinogen psilocybin and then consumes them from the inside.</p>\n<p>The Goldwater has an opinion section, which posts content similar to other opinionated content featured in other sections of the website.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Goldwater.com frequently publishes false information and conspiracy theories about everything from UFO sightings to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. It published more than a dozen stories in 2018 that suggested Bill and Hillary Clinton are responsible for up to 17 deaths.</p>\n<p>One story, headlined “Clinton Body Count Series #5: Woman Set to Testify Against Clintons Blown Up in Home Explosion,” alleges that 72-year-old retired nurse Caroline Paladino was identified by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service as “a ‘probable witness’ against the Clinton Foundation.” In fact, the explosion referred to in the headline, which killed Paladino, was caused by a gas leak at the New Jersey woman’s home, state authorities said. The Goldwater stated in its article that investigators did not suspect foul play, but the article still claimed that Paladino had unwittingly become a “target hit.”</p>\n<p>Other deaths that the site’s writers said were linked to the Clintons include a woman whose body was found in the trash chute of former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner’s New York City apartment building (Weiner’s ex-wife, Huma Abedin, was a top Hillary Clinton aide); former model Judi Gibbs, and Vincent Foster, a deputy White House counsel during the first six months of Clinton's presidency. </p>\n<p>Other false theories shared by The Goldwater includes those that recount multiple conspiracy theories surrounding the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.  For example, a December 2018 article alleged that Jewish people and insider traders knew of the attacks before they occurred, and that “Aluminum planes can’t penetrate steel structure of World Trade Center. This has been proven by engineers.”</p>\n<p>The Goldwater does not disclose a political agenda, although it routinely publishes news from a conservative perspective.  For example, the site depicts migrants in the caravan that traveled from Central America to the U.S border as diseased and criminal. Another news story claimed that the mainstream media was censoring Trump, and that the “Democratic Party is now scrambling to hurl whatever they can” at Republicans. </p>\n<p>The Goldwater runs deceptive headlines, including those used in the Clinton Body Count section, as well as stories such as, “Robert Mueller lied to the court by withholding exculpatory evidence to exonerate Trump!” and “9/11 attacks -- true stories aren’t kept secret -- there are no coincidences (Videos).”  </p>\n<p>The Goldwater does not state a corrections policy, and NewsGuard could not find examples of corrections.</p>\n<p>Because The Goldwater regularly publishes false stories, including some that advance politically conservative positions, NewsGuard has determined that the site repeatedly publishes false content, does not gather and present information responsibly, and does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. </p>\n<p>NewsGuard’s two emails to a general address at The Goldwater seeking comment on its editorial practices and publication of false content did not get a response. NewsGuard could not locate a telephone number for either the website or Watkins.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The Goldwater names most of its authors, although some are only identified by their first name. It does not provide contact or biographical information about them. The site does not name its editors, nor does it disclose its ownership. </p>\n<p>The Goldwater did not respond to NewsGuard’s two emails seeking comment on the lack of information about its content creators, editors, and owner.  </p>\n<p>The Goldwater does not run display advertisements, but some content labeled “promoted” is posted on the site, and appears distinct from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Watkins told BuzzFeed that he founded thegoldwater.com to counter the “fake news and propaganda” of news organizations such as The New York Times and The Washington Post. BuzzFeed reported that Watkins generates much of the traffic for his site by posting links on 8Chan. Internet archive records show thegoldwater.com began publishing in 2016.</p>\n<p>Watkins told BuzzFeed he named the site for Barry Goldwater, the conservative Republican U.S. senator from Arizona who unsuccessfully ran for president in 1964.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Peggy
