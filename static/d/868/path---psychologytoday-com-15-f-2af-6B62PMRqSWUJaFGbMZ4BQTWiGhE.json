The publication is funded by subscriptions, sales of the print magazine, advertisements, and online directories of mental health professionals who pay to list their services.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Psychologytoday.com includes hundreds of blogs, opinion pieces, and listicles written by experts in mental health. Content covers relationships, sex, happiness, and work, among other topics. Stories in the Cognition blog have included “Why You Should Be Worried About Underconfidence” and “The Performing Art Of Being A Couple.” </p>\n<p>The website features dozens of self-tests on subjects such as career-problem solving and parenting, and provides a diagnosis dictionary which defines different conditions. Directories of mental health professionals are available, such as “Find a Therapist,” which lists psychologists and social workers by city or zipcode, and provides their photographs, contact information, and the medical insurance they accept.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Psychology Today is not an academic journal, although mental health specialists write the content, and there are often bibliographies included at the bottom of stories that reference case studies, statistics, and academic papers. Headlines accurately reflect the content of stories.</p>\n<p>The website does not state a corrections policy, nor could NewsGuard independently verify that it regularly makes corrections. Psychology Today did not respond to NewsGuard’s two emails and a phone call seeking more information about how the site handles corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Psychology Today names its authors, editors, and senior staff, and provides information about them. Readers can contact writers and staff through a general email form on the website. The site provides the address and phone number of the main office, but does not clearly disclose that Sussex Publishers owns Psychology Today. Advertising is clearly labeled.</p>\n<p>Psychology Today did not respond to NewsGuard’s two emails and a phone call seeking comment on why the website does not clearly disclose its ownership by Sussex Publishers.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Nicholas Charney, a psychologist, founded Psychology Today magazine in 1967 because he wanted to make the subject more accessible. The website was created in 1997.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nJohn Gregory&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4849607\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4849607</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.buzzfile.com/business/Psychology-Today-212-260-7210\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.buzzfile.com/business/Psychology-Today-212-260-7210 </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.psychcentral.com/kickstart/2015/04/do-i-need-a-psychology-today-profile/\" target=\"_blank\">https://pro.psychcentral.com/kickstart/2015/04/do-i-need-a-psychology-today-profile/ </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/perfectly-confident/201806/why-you-should-be-worried-about-underconfidence\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/perfectly-confident/201806/why-you-should-be-worried-about-underconfidence </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/quite-queerly/201806/the-performing-art-being-couple\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/quite-queerly/201806/the-performing-art-being-couple </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/get-out-your-mind/201806/how-deal-stress\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/get-out-your-mind/201806/how-deal-stress </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/lifetime-connections/201808/4-signs-you-re-dating-sexual-narcissist\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/lifetime-connections/201808/4-signs-you-re-dating-sexual-narcissist </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/between-the-lines/201103/do-race-based-scholarships-ensure-equal-access-higher-education\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/between-the-lines/201103/do-race-based-scholarships-ensure-equal-access-higher-education </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-neuroscientist-who-lost-her-mind/201809/when-someones-personality-transforms-pay-attention\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-neuroscientist-who-lost-her-mind/201809/when-someones-personality-transforms-pay-attention </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/tests\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/tests </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/new-york?gclid=Cj0KCQjwz93cBRCrARIsAEFbWsgZdUySubh6ZyonIG_ATZMrKgorL6RuEDiHHe-e1apm8wZ4oqUzbnEaAlzGEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/new-york?gclid=Cj0KCQjwz93cBRCrARIsAEFbWsgZdUySubh6ZyonIG<em>ATZMrKgorL6RuEDiHHe-e1apm8wZ4oqUzbnEaAlzGEALw</em>wcB</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-neuroscientist-who-lost-her-mind/201809/when-someones-personality-transforms-pay-attention\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-neuroscientist-who-lost-her-mind/201809/when-someones-personality-transforms-pay-attention </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-neuroscientist-who-lost-her-mind/201809/when-someones-personality-transforms-pay-attention\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-neuroscientist-who-lost-her-mind/201809/when-someones-personality-transforms-pay-attention </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/about-psychology-today\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/about-psychology-today </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/experts/all\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/experts/all </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/experts/kaja-perina\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/experts/kaja-perina </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Psychology-Today\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.britannica.com/topic/Psychology-Today </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/psychologytoday.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.whois.com/whois/psychologytoday.com </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/201707/note-the-founder\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/201707/note-the-founder </a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"psychologytoday.com","author":"Evan Haddad","date":"2018-10-04T20:57:31.163+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/psychologytoday.com/"}}
