Lee Enterprises’ newspapers generate revenue from advertising and subscriptions to their printed and digital editions.</p>\n<p>Siouxcityjournal.com offers a limited number of free articles before charging users for access to digital content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Co</h3>\n<p>Siouxcityjournal.com publishes local news in the Siouxland region, including articles on government, business, and education. The site's SUX 911 section runs daily updates on breaking news, crime, and courts around Siouxland.</p>\n<p>The website’s Politically Speaking blog covers regional and state political news, while its Weekender section features listings of events and things to do in and around Sioux City. The site provides original coverage of local and state sports events, including Sioux City Musketeers hockey and Sioux City Bandits indoor football games.</p>\n<p>The website often republishes articles from other Lee-owned newspapers, including the Quad-City Times in Davenport, Iowa, and the Lincoln Journal Star in Lincoln, Nebraska, as well as content from The Associated Press, CNN, and Tribune Content Agency.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Siouxcityjournal.com articles are based on reporting from reliable sources, including government officials, court records, law enforcement agencies, people with firsthand knowledge of events, and subject experts.</p>\n<p>The Sioux City Journal has won five general excellence first-place awards at the National Newspaper Association’s Better Newspaper Contest -- most recently in 2018. The paper received 21 citations that year, including 10 first-place awards. Editor &#x26; Publisher magazine named the Sioux City Journal twice on its annual list of \"10 Newspapers That Do It Right.\" In 2013, Editor &#x26; Publisher praised the newspaper's \"immediate and dramatic impact in the community\" after the Journal published a front-page editorial addressing the dangers of bullying, and its representatives met with local advocates, schools and state leaders to raise awareness on the issue.  </p>\n<p>The website does not post a corrections policy, but it does regularly issue corrections, typically in standalone articles that explain the mistakes and when they appeared.</p>\n<p>Editorials, commentary, and letters to the editor are published in the website’s Opinion section, separate from news. Headlines accurately reflect story content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles written by Sioux City Journal staff writers include their contact information and social media profiles. A Staff page lists the names of the newspaper's leading editors and reporters, along with their phone numbers, email addresses and Twitter handles.</p>\n<p>The Journal’s ownership by Lee is not disclosed on the website. Users who click on a Work Here page about job openings at the publication are directed to a page on Lee’s corporate website, where information about its connection to the Journal is not easily accessible.</p>\n<p>The site publishes paid content in news articles under the headline Around the Web on the homepage. The articles, provided by the ad company ZergNet, are not clearly marked as advertising or sponsored content, which has led NewsGuard to determine that SiouxCityJournal.com does not adequately label advertising.</p>\n<p>In response to a NewsGuard inquiry, Lee Enterprises is reviewing its current policies on ownership and sponsored content disclosure, said John Humenik, the company’s vice president of news.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Sioux City Journal began publication in 1864. It was sold to the newspaper company Hagadone Corp., in a 50/50 partnership with Howard Publications, in 1971. In February 2002, Lee Enterprises purchased Howard Publications. Lee announced in June 2002 that it would acquire Hagadone's remaining 50 percent interest in the newspaper.  </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSophia Tewa\n\nEdited by:\nAmy
