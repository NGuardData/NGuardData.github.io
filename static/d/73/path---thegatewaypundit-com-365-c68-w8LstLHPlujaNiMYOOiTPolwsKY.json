The site runs advertisements and collects donations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Gateway Pundit publishes general and political news stories, with a focus on President Trump and his administration. Articles generally feature the Gateway Pundit’s commentary alongside tweets, video clips, and blocks of reporting from national and international news publications, such as CNBC, The Hill, and The Daily Caller.</p>\n<p>The site includes a slogan at the top of its page, stating, “We report the truth - And leave the Russia-Collusion fairy tale to the Conspiracy media,” referring to the investigation looking into  whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin to influence the 2016 presidential election results.</p>\n<p>Headlines and articles are highly opinionated and right-leaning. For example, a July 2018 article “SLIP? Obama in Africa: ‘I Visited Kenya as First American President to Come from Kenya’” used a remark from Barack Obama made about his heritage to perpetuate the conspiracy theory that he was born in Kenya. </p>\n<p>The site also runs “Gateway Pundit Polls,” allowing viewers to answer “yes” or “no” to leading questions, such as “Should Jeff Sessions Appoint A Second Special Counsel?” or “Do you side with the NRA?”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Gateway Pundit’s articles have been regularly declared false by numerous fact-checking organizations and news publications, including Snopes, Politifact, FactCheck.org, the Washington Post, CNN, and the Chicago Tribune. The Gateway Pundit made national news early in 2018 for spreading a false, widely debunked conspiracy theory that the student survivors who spoke out after of the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida were “crisis actors.” </p>\n<p>In September 2018, as college professor Christine Blassey Ford publicly accused  then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her while in high school, the site quickly reported on negative reviews that a different Professor Christine Ford had received on a professor-rating website —  without checking to see if the person it was referring to was the same professor who was Judge Kavanaugh's accuser. The Christine Ford who received the negative reviews actually worked at another California university, and  GatewayPundit.com was forced to issue an \"update\" later that day, after the story had been shared thousands of times.</p>\n<p>The Gateway Pundit consistently presents Democrats in a negative light, regularly referring to them as “dirty” and “unhinged,” and presents Trump and the Republican Party in a positive light. Stories are therefore regularly one-sided. A July 2018 article cited an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll in its claim that “more than 56 percent of voters find the Democrat Party out of step with American mainstream.” In fact, the poll found that 56 percent of voters polled believed Democratic candidates for Congress to be “out of step with most Americans' thinking,” while 57 percent of voters polled believed Republican candidates for Congress to be “out of step.”</p>\n<p>In November 2016, the site reported that a string of buses in Austin, Texas had brought paid protesters to stage a fake protest against recently elected President Donald Trump. The article cited as its source three photographs tweeted by a bystander. The bus passengers were participants in a local conference unrelated to the presidential race, according to Snopes. After the story went viral, and Trump complained in a tweet about the paid protesters, major news organizations debunked the story and the bystander issued a correction tweet. The Gateway Pundit article was updated to include at the bottom: “Controversy: media reports that buses were not protest buses.” </p>\n<p>In August 2016, the site published a photograph of what it described as the crowd at a Trump event in Portland, Maine, when the photo was actually taken at a Cleveland Cavaliers championship parade. After Media Matters flagged this post, the Gateway Pundit removed the image but did not publish a correction.</p>\n<p>Headlines are often sensational and misleading, and information is regularly distorted. For example, a July 2018 article “PUTIN DROPS BOMB AT HELSINKI PRESSER: Says US Intelligence Helped Move $400,000 to HILLARY Campaign!!” cited Putin’s speech and an opinion article by the Washington Post as its sources. However, Putin stated that financier Bill Browder had moved the money, and suggested that “we have a solid reason to believe that some intelligence officers accompanied and guided these transactions.” The Gateway Pundit changed “some intelligence officers” to “some [US] intelligence officers” when quoting Putin, although this was not part of his speech. The Gateway Pundit also failed to disclose that the Washington Post article was an opinion piece, stating “The Washington Post reported.”</p>\n<p>The site occasionally publishes updates to articles, but many stories flagged as “false” by fact-checking organizations and news publications have not been corrected. The site does not regularly run corrections.</p>\n<p>The Gateway Pundit and Hoft did not respond to two NewsGuard messages seeking comment about the site’s editorial practices, including how it gathers and presents information and handles the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles do not provide biographical or contact information about their writers. The site’s About page features information about Hoft. The right side of the every page features a “Contact The Gateway Pundit” section that lists links to general email addresses, including a direct email link to Hoft. This sidebar also directs users to the site’s Facebook page, as well as donation button.</p>\n<p>The site clearly labels advertisements.</p>\n<p>The Gateway Pundit and Hoft did not respond to three NewsGuard messages seeking comment on the website’s lack of transparency about its content creators.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Hoft launched TheGatewayPundit.com in 2004, after George W. Bush was re-elected president over Democrat John Kerry. The name refers to St. Louis, home of the Gateway Arch, where Hoft is based. In 2012, Hoft served as an associate producer for “Hating Breitbart,” a film described by the New York Post as “less a documentary than a wholly uncritical celebration” of Andrew Breitbart, the conservative commentator who founded Breitbart.com.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this label miscounted the number of times NewsGuard originally emailed Gateway Pundit for comment; it was once, although two additional attempts have been made since. Additionally, the original email did not address the lack of transparency about Gateway Pundit’s content creators, but a follow up message did address that issue.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Joyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.jim.hoft\" target=\"_blank\">https://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.jim.hoft</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/what-is-gateway-pundit-the-conspiracy-hawking-site-at-the-center-of-the-bogus-florida-crisis-actors-hype/2018/02/23/dded562a-174e-11e8-b681-2d4d462a1921_story.html?utm_term=.412696b861f0\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/what-is-gateway-pundit-the-conspiracy-hawking-site-at-the-center-of-the-bogus-florida-crisis-actors-hype/2018/02/23/dded562a-174e-11e8-b681-2d4d462a1921<em>story.html?utm</em>term=.412696b861f0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/07/obama-to-african-audience-i-visited-kenya-as-first-american-president-to-come-from-kenya/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/07/obama-to-african-audience-i-visited-kenya-as-first-american-president-to-come-from-kenya/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/07/it-begins-fascist-democrat-lawmaker-deutch-calls-on-facebook-to-block-infowars-during-congressional-hearing-video/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/07/it-begins-fascist-democrat-lawmaker-deutch-calls-on-facebook-to-block-infowars-during-congressional-hearing-video/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/07/latest-poll-finds-todays-democrat-party-scares-the-hell-out-of-voters/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/07/latest-poll-finds-todays-democrat-party-scares-the-hell-out-of-voters/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/i/today/z_creative/18570NBCWSJJulyPoll7-22-18Release.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/i/today/z_creative/18570NBCWSJJulyPoll7-22-18Release.pdf</a></li>\n<li>BOOM!
