Norton is owned by William Sagan, who started Wolfgang's in 2002 after acquiring the musical archives of the longtime rock 'n' roll concert promoter Bill Graham. The company sells live music recordings and merchandise on its website, Wolfgangs.com.</p>\n<p>PasteMagazine.com derives revenue from advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Paste Magazine primarily publishes articles, essays, and reviews on entertainment and the music industry, including news on new music releases, artist profiles, and guides to various music genres from rock to jazz to hip hop to pop. The site's Daytrotter section offers videos of live performances recorded from the company's studios in New York and Davenport, Iowa.</p>\n<p>Although Paste started in 2002 as a music magazine, it has since expanded to cover a variety of other topics, including movies, comedy, politics, television, books, and games. The website also produces lists and rankings on pop culture topics, such as \"The 25 Best Nintendo Games of the 1980s,\" \"The Funniest Tweets of the Week,\" and \"The Week In Music: The Best Albums, Songs, Performances and More.\"</p>\n<p>The site covers U.S. politics and the Trump administration, mostly with opinionated articles on  major political events and policies. Ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, the site posted a guide to legislative races in each state. The site also posts humorous social media reactions to political news events, such as \"The Funniest Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort Tweets,\" \"The Funniest Tweets About Ted Cruz's Twitter Porn Gaffe\" and \"The Funniest Tweets about Ivanka Trump Shutting Down Her Brand.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Paste Magazine's entertainment news coverage is generally based on interviews with artists, industry professionals, and the reporting of reliable media sources, such as Rolling Stone magazine and Deadline Hollywood.</p>\n<p>The magazine does not have a posted corrections policy, although it regularly corrects errors with italicized, explanatory notes within stories.</p>\n<p>Paste Magazine's political section provides news and commentary that is generally critical of the Trump administration and its policies, although the website does not disclose that it subscribes to any partisan ideology. Most opinionated political stories are not labeled as such, which is why NewsGuard has determined that Paste Magazine does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>For example, a November 2018 article titled \"The White House Posted A Doctored Video to Justify the Unjustifiable: They Are Excusing Political Violence\" said that U.S. President Donald Trump \"lacks the moral capacity for introspection, as does his amoral cult of followers. The extreme rhetoric of the extreme MAGA right is nothing short of an endorsement of terrorism, and a permission slip for more.\"  Other opinionated articles in 2018 on the Trump administration include, \"The Press Has Contributed to the Rise of Fascism in America and Around the World,\" \"This is why people hate Congress,\" and \"Paul Ryan Just Single-handedly Prevented Us from Stopping Our Own War Crimes.\"</p>\n<p>Paste Magazine’s editor in chief, Josh Jackson, told NewsGuard in an email that Paste’s stories are marked as News, Reviews, and Features. He called the latter category “a catch-all that includes essays, opinion pieces and analysis, as well as interview-based artist profiles or Q&#x26;As.</p>\n<p>“Most of what we publish is commentary in one form or another,” Jackson said. “We do have some multi-sourced originally reported pieces in many of our sections (Music, Movies, TV, Comedy, Games, Books, Comics, Drink and Politics), and the nature of those stories is usually clear in the headline.\"</p>\n<p>Headlines in pastemagazine.com accurately represent the content in stories.</p>\n<p>Paste was nominated for three National Magazine Awards in the category of general excellence in 2008, 2009, and 2010. The magazine was also nominated in 2010 in the reviews and criticism category for a series of music reviews.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site does not clearly disclose that it is owned by Paste Media Group and Norton LLC. A 2011 article about the acquisition of the magazine by Norton does not identify the company by name. Jackson told NewsGuard that Paste Media Group is identified in a copyright disclosure at the bottom of the website. But that small-print disclosure does not meet NewsGuard's standard for disclosing ownership in a user-friendly manner.</p>\n<p>The homepage links to a masthead page, which contains the names and contact information of its editors. It also lists contributing writers for each section of the site.</p>\n<p>Author names are generally included at the top of stories and link to a list of the writer's most recent articles on the site. Paste occasionally lists biographies for some contributing writers, but  does not generally provide contact or biographical information for most of its writing staff.</p>\n<p>\"Some articles include short bios and Twitter info, some don't. It's really up to individual writers and section editors,\" Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Advertisements on the site are distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Paste Magazine published its first issue as a monthly publication in July 2002. It became an online-only publication in 2010. Norton acquired the magazine in 2011.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSophia Tewa\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Yemile
