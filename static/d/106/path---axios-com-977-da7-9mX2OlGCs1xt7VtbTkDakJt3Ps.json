The site does not say if the trio owns the site.</p>\n<p>Axios has raised money from venture capitalists and gets revenue through advertising on its website and its newsletters.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Axios breaks its coverage into several sections, including: Technology, Politics, Business, Health Care, Science, Future, Energy, and World. (It also sends out newsletters for many of its major coverage areas.) Mike Allen sends out a widely read early morning newsletter every day with 10 bulleted items about the biggest stories of the day.</p>\n<p>Stories on the site are usually short, and word counts are listed (typically within the range of 200-500 words). Most are bullet-pointed -- an effort to distill information clearly and efficiently. Phrases such as Be Smart and Why It Matters are often appended to articles or newsletter blurbs to highlight the main takeaway for readers. </p>\n<p>The site quickly gained a reputation as a major player in Washington media and political circles and a generator of buzz-worthy political scoops. It was the first news site to report that the United States would pull out of the Paris climate accord, for example. Axios also broke the news that President Donald Trump was expected to name Anthony Scaramucci White House communications director as well as the story that FBI Director Christopher Wray threatened to resign amid pressure from the Trump administration to fire then FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.</p>\n<p>When the site launched in 2017, its first story was an interview with President Trump.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Content on the site is credited to named writers, and contact information is provided for some reporters. Headlines are mostly simple declarative sentences, for instance: “Kids as young as 1 face judges in immigration court.” Reporters on the site do original reporting and break news regularly. </p>\n<p>When Allen was at Politico, he created Playbook, an early morning newsletter that he sent out each day. In 2010, he was the subject of a New York Times Magazine article, in which he was called “the man the White House wakes up to.”</p>\n<p>Axios regularly publishes corrections, and the site updates content in its articles and newsletters. Users can request corrections to a general newsroom email listed on the site.</p>\n<p>Axios Editor-in-Chief Nicholas Johnston told NewsGuard that emails sent to this address go to a group of editors and that he reads “every single message.”</p>\n<p>Johnston sent NewsGuard the site’s extensive corrections policy, which stresses the importance of transparency and includes detailed protocol on how to make corrections and clarifications. That policy, though, is not posted on the site.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles typically include the name of the writer, but no contact or biographical information is included for many of them.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard sent Johnston examples of author pages that do not provide this information. He said he would “bother those reporters” about updating their pages, adding that most of them are recent hires.</p>\n<p>The site clearly identifies its management team. An email address to contact the newsroom is available through the site, although there is no direct contact information for top management and editors. A roster of editors and reporters is listed on the About page, with names, titles, and photographs, but no other information.</p>\n<p>The site identifies its founders and leadership, but does not say that they are the owners. </p>\n<p>“Our ownership has been widely reported,” Johnston told NewsGuard. “I guess we never thought about posting it [on the site].” Johnston said that he would look into including this information.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Axios was founded in 2016 with the stated intention of simplifying the news. Its mission statement reads, “At Axios — the Greek word for worthy — we provide only content worthy of people’s time, attention and trust.” </p>\n<p><em>Disclosure: NewsGuard co-CEO Steven Brill consulted for and contributed to Axios in the initial months of its launch and is friendly with co-founders Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei.</em></p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This Nutrition Label and the criteria checklist have been updated to indicate that the site does not disclose its ownership or adequately provide information about its content creators.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBen Strauss\n\nEdited by:\nEric Effron&#x26;emsp;Yemile Bucay&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/mike-allen-and-jim-vandehei-reveal-their-plan-for-media-domination-axios\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/mike-allen-and-jim-vandehei-reveal-their-plan-for-media-domination-axios</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/axios-raises-20-million-to-fund-newsroom-expansion-1510853567\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/axios-raises-20-million-to-fund-newsroom-expansion-1510853567</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/11/20/politicos-mike-allen-native-advertising-pioneer/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/11/20/politicos-mike-allen-native-advertising-pioneer/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/axios-raises-additional-20-million-fund-newsroom-expansion/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thewrap.com/axios-raises-additional-20-million-fund-newsroom-expansion/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/axios-launches-with-donald-trump-interview/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thewrap.com/axios-launches-with-donald-trump-interview/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/stevenperlberg/be-smart-mike-allen-wrote-the-rules-of-washington-and-now?utm_term=.boZPKloq5#.fke6mDlW3\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/stevenperlberg/be-smart-mike-allen-wrote-the-rules-of-washington-and-now?utm_term=.boZPKloq5#.fke6mDlW3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/immigration-court-judges-young-children-child-separation-0a2e2555-c523-4297-b50d-83ed1d865de6.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.axios.com/immigration-court-judges-young-children-child-separation-0a2e2555-c523-4297-b50d-83ed1d865de6.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-expected-to-make-scaramucci-communications-director-1513388208-064eb1d4-1a84-4971-84b7-058c6d2d5ef3.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.axios.com/trump-expected-to-make-scaramucci-communications-director-1513388208-064eb1d4-1a84-4971-84b7-058c6d2d5ef3.html</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/scoop-sessions-fbi-trump-christopher-wray-877adb3e-5f8d-44a1-8a2f-d4f0894ca6a7.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.axios.com/scoop-sessions-fbi-trump-christopher-wray-877adb3e-5f8d-44a1-8a2f-d4f0894ca6a7.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/stevenperlberg/be-smart-mike-allen-wrote-the-rules-of-washington-and-now?utm_term=.boZPKloq5#.fke6mDlW3\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/stevenperlberg/be-smart-mike-allen-wrote-the-rules-of-washington-and-now?utm_term=.boZPKloq5#.fke6mDlW3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/magazine/25allen-t.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/magazine/25allen-t.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/inside-justices-new-plan-to-share-info-on-foreign-meddling-7f3228af-66c6-4e6e-bc6a-1b81cd519721.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.axios.com/inside-justices-new-plan-to-share-info-on-foreign-meddling-7f3228af-66c6-4e6e-bc6a-1b81cd519721.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/why-startups-arent-pushing-feds-to-break-up-big-tech-6554ed4b-f56c-485f-9bc9-929bcb23dbe3.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.axios.com/why-startups-arent-pushing-feds-to-break-up-big-tech-6554ed4b-f56c-485f-9bc9-929bcb23dbe3.html</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-vitals-562556ef-e7dd-4d54-9694-757423d93c7a.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-vitals-562556ef-e7dd-4d54-9694-757423d93c7a.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.axios.com/about</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"axios.com","author":"Ben Strauss","date":"2018-10-31T20:25:40.609+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/axios.com/"}}
