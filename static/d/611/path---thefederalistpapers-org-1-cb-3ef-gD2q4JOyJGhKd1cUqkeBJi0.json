Nevada business records list Straub as the company’s president and director. The site generates revenue from advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>TheFederalistPapers.org says on its site it aims to “get people the power that knowledge gives to motivate them to push back at the erosion of our liberties and restore constitutionally limited small government.” Its name is a reference to the Federalist Papers, a series of essays written by founding fathers Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison to advocate for the ratification of the constitution.</p>\n<p>At least half of the content on its homepage in August 2018 consisted of republished stories from The Daily Caller News Foundation, a conservative news publisher, along with original stories discussing topics such as political figures’ television appearances and developments in the Trump administration. Its coverage is divided into categories including Video, Politics, Education, Economy, and Opinion.</p>\n<p>Opinion stories are comprised of quotations aggregated from news sites, which range from NPR to redstate.com, interspersed with cartoons, memes, and commentary from the article’s author. </p>\n<p>Its original articles consistently exhibit a conservative slant, praising the Trump administration and Republicans and criticizing Democratic politicians and liberal news organizations. Opinion headlines include “Federal Judge Halts Secret Plot Targeting Conservative Groups,” “The CRAZY Reason FBI Didn’t Search Clinton Aide’s Devices,” and “This North Korea Meme Has Liberal Journalists Exploding With Rage.”</p>\n<p>Straub told NewsGuard that TheFederalistPapers.org, which launched in 2011, “started long ago as a site dedicated to teaching American history but evolved over time into political commentary.” He told NewsGuard in a June 2018 email that the site had “made the decision to focus exclusively on opinion” and would label every article published as such. As of September 2018, the site published some original stories labeled ‘OPINION’ once users click on a headline, some original stories labeled as news, which were also highly opinionated, and Daily Caller news stories. The Federalist Papers’ mission statement, detailed in an About page, does not identify it as an opinion site.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The majority of recent content on the site as of August 2018 was republished from The Daily Caller, a site that NewsGuard has judged gathers and presents information responsibly, which is why NewsGuard has arrived at the same conclusion when evaluating TheFederalistPapers.org. </p>\n<p>However, because TheFederalistPapers.org’s original content consists of stories that are not labeled opinion that are in, fact, mostly opinion, often supported by statements of fact that are debatable, NewsGuard has determined that the site fails to handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>For example, an April 2018 news story (“The REAL REASON Democrats Don’t Want Armed Guards in Schools”) asserts, “Democrats are willing to move their anti-gun agenda forward on as many bodies as possible hoping the carnage will change minds.” It also included a meme that depicted a man telling his child that “the Democrats want you to die in a school shooting, so that they can take away everyone’s guns.”</p>\n<p>An August 2018 opinion story (“‘Racist Phrase’ Democrats Can Use With Impunity on Social Media”) said that “truth is racism was almost dead in the USA until Obama and the Democrats decided crying racism at every opponent and at every turn was a useful tool,” but did not provide evidence to substantiate its claim that “racism was almost dead” prior to Obama’s tenure as president. </p>\n<p>In an August 2018 news story headlined “Democrat Voter Registration Effort Stumbles; Blue Wave in Doubt,” the author stated that “of course what’s bad for the Democrat [sic] party is good for America.”</p>\n<p>Both news stories and opinion pieces provide positive coverage of Republican figures and negative coverage of Democrats. Headlines are often sensational or emotionally charged, making statements such as “Democrats Are STILL The Party Of Racism Today…” (August 2017) and “New Gun Store Sign Has Liberals Screaming With Rage” (June 2017). One of the site’s most common patterns in sensationalizing its headlines is to exaggerate the reaction of Democrats to something a Republican figure has said or done. For example, the story “James Woods Latest Tweet Has Whiny Democrats Howling With Rage” (July 2018) implies in its headline that Democrats became incensed over a tweet by conservative actor James Woods. The story, however, fails to reference any Democratic opposition.</p>\n<p>Straub told NewsGuard that the site’s headlines often reflect “our opinion of the event being discussed so I guess the accuracy can be debated depending on your political point of view. That said, we strive for accuracy in everything we do and each story usually goes through 2-3 people just to double check each story meets our standards.”</p>\n<p>The site does not attribute images featured in its stories.</p>\n<p>The site does not list a corrections policy. Straub told NewsGuard that the site deletes posts that were found to be incorrect, and that the site notifies its followers of the error on its Facebook page, a practice that he says “has increased the trust our core audience has of our content.” NewsGuard could not find any instances of corrections issued on the site’s Facebook page, and Straub did not respond to an email asking for examples of corrections posted on Facebook.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Many articles on the site lack clear bylines and are only attributed to “TFPP Writer” or pseudonyms like “Bushrod Washington.” Straub told NewsGuard in an email that there is no individual contact information for writers “because there is no need for it. People can contact us via our site, or Facebook page.” Articles with specific bylines include brief biographies and a contact form to reach the author.</p>\n<p>Integrated Marketing Group Inc. is not referenced on the site. Straub told NewsGuard that the site does not list its ownership information because “the left, via Antifa and others, have opted for violence and / or character and livelihood assassination and target those who think differently and oppose them. We do not make it easy for those who wish to do us harm to find us and we'll keep it that way. It in NO WAY impacts what we do, or make us ‘fake news’ in any way.”</p>\n<p>Some advertising is clearly distinguishable from the site’s written content. However, the site hosts news stories from other websites on the right side of the homepage in a section called “Recommended.” These stories do not appear when users activate an ad blocker, a type of software that prevents ads from appearing on a website. The “Recommended” section is also labeled “Ads by Revcontent” in small letters, but NewsGuard has concluded that this phrase does not sufficiently distinguish the ads from the site’s content, as they so closely resemble news stories. Straub did not reply to a NewsGuard email seeking comment about the site’s advertising practices.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site was created in 2011.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nNina
