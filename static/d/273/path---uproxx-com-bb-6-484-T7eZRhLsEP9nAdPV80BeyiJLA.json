The sites carry advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Besides breaking news of interest to its predominantly male millennial audience, the home page has tabs for entertainment, music, sports, life/discovery and video/podcasts.</p>\n<p>The top news link shares content from theintercept.com,  which is focused on national security. Sports coverage includes stories about pro wrestling. Entertainment coverage offers a broad range of TV and movies; and hip-hop and indie rock get most of the music attention. Shorter articles are usually trending news stories, while longer pieces strive to offer a big-picture, distinctive voice.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Stories typically have multiple, named sources, and headlines capture their  articles’ content. Photos complement stories; photo credits are given, but many are supplied by the publicity departments of TV shows or movie studios that illustrate stories on the site. </p>\n<p>A headline such as “ ‘Solo’ Is Officially The Least Interesting ‘Star Wars’ Movie To Talk About” demonstrates a critical eye. Other typical headlines: “The Dos and Don’ts of Dining at a Restaurant Without Being a Jerk” and “From ‘Dark Fantasy’ to ‘Ye’: Kanye West’s Decade-Long Slide from Greatness to Mediocrity.” </p>\n<p>No corrections appeared on the site. A NewsGuard email seeking information on its corrections policy wasn’t returned.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Stories have bylines, which supply a mini-biography of the writer. The masthead gives emails and Twitter handles for ranking editors, staffers and the studio and leadership team, as well as a street address.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Jarret Myer and Brian Brater, co-founders of the hip-hop Rawkus Records label, launched the site in 2008.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nDouglas Rowe\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Joyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>","frontmatter":{"title":"uproxx.com","author":"Douglas Rowe","date":"2018-07-20T14:06:16.583+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/uproxx.com/"}}
