State documents reveal Alex Jones as the company’s manager. Infowars finances itself by selling nutritional supplements and survival gear. Infowars.com is also funded by what it terms “moneybomb” fundraising events on Jones’s show. A description of Jones on Infowars.com says that “Alex has never taken a loan and is not beholden to advertisers, investors or any other group that could censor or influence his position.” </p>\n<p>Infowars.com runs advertisements for nutritional products and survival gear sold on Infowarsstore.com, which is also owned by Free Speech Systems LLC. On his talk show, which is broadcast on radio stations across the country and live-streamed on Infowars.com, Jones’ promotes and sells these same products. A former staffer told Buzzfeed in 2017 the system is “like QVC for conspiracy.” </p>\n<p>NewsGuard sent three emails to an Infowars’ media contact email address, as well as messages to two editors through the site’s messaging system and a voicemail left on on a media line phone number, seeking comment on the site’s business model. None of the emails or messages drew a response. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Infowars.com is the online platform for Jones’ show, which runs six days a week, as well as the many videos he uploads to the internet. Infowars.com live-streams the show and publishes video clips from it as separate stories on its homepage. The site has published full episodes, as well as videos from field correspondents and analysis from other hosts.</p>\n<p>The site publishes news stories on its homepage that are written by staff members. Next to those stories, it publishes stories from other news outlets. Infowars.com usually does this by republishing the first few paragraphs of the story from another website, and then providing a Read More link to the original story.</p>\n<p>Buzzfeed reported in 2017 that Infowars routinely posts content without seeking the publisher’s permission, taking articles from more than a dozen outlets, including The New York Times, conservative site Breitbart, BBC, CNN, and Buzzfeed itself. Buzzfeed also reported that in the previous three years, Infowars copied without permission more than 1,000 articles from RT, the Russian-sponsored propaganda site.</p>\n<p>Two of the sites with stories published on Infowars told NewsGuard they had not given permission for their content to be shared on the site. Infowars did not reply to four emails seeking comment about this practice. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Stories and videos on Infowars.com, including clips and episodes from Jones’ show, claimed 9/11 was orchestrated by the Bush administration, that the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary that left 20 children dead was a “giant hoax,” that NASA is sending child sex slaves to Mars, that Hillary Clinton is a literal “demon” and an “interdimensional invader” who ran a child sex ring out of Washington, D.C., area pizza restaurant, that former President Barack Obama engineered Hurricane Sandy in order to help win the 2012 election, and that Bill Gates is attempting to “sterilize and destroy the third world through vaccinations.”</p>\n<p>In 2018, Alex Jones used Infowars.com to spread the theory that Anthony Bourdain, who took his own life in June 2018, may have been murdered because he “was planning to go public against the deep state.” Also in 2018, Infowars has helped spread the “Qanon” conspiracy theory, which holds that President Trump is planning to launch a massive purge of the “deep state” and celebrity pedophile rings, a belief based on the cryptic writings of an anonymous online poster who goes by “Q.” On July 1, 2018, Infowars published a post with the headline “Breaking: Democrats Plan To Launch Civil War On July 4th.” In the post, a clip of Jones warning about the civil war was titled “Democrats Announce America’s Last 4th of July.”  </p>\n<p>Infowars did not respond to three emails asking if the site stood by these claims. NewsGuard also sent messages through the website to two editors asking about these claims, and left a voicemail on the Infowars media phone line. There was no response. </p>\n<p>Jones and Infowars.com have retracted some stories and apologized for some claims, usually as a result of actual or threatened legal action. For example, in 2017, under the threat of legal action, Jones apologized to the owner of a Washington, D.C. pizza restaurant after he implicated the establishment in a debunked pedophilia conspiracy involving Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. That same year, he apologized for saying yogurt company Chobani supported “migrant rapists,” as part of a legal settlement with the company. Beginning in April 2018, families of the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting sued Jones for defamation for claiming the massacre was a hoax. He has since acknowledged that the massacre took place. The suits are pending.</p>\n<p>In a child custody case, Jones’s lawyers argued in court that Jones is a “performance artist” and his public persona was not to be taken seriously, as he is “playing a character.”</p>\n<p>Infowars headlines are often sensational. One May 2018 headline declared “Gay Star Wars Signals End Of Western Civilization.” A July 2018 headline read “Watch Live As Giant Leftist Temper Tantrums Erupt Nationwide Against Kavanaugh Nomination.”</p>\n<p>According to the Corrections page of the site, as of September 2018, Infowars.com has corrected four stories in its history -- one in 2017 when it misquoted Donald Trump, one in 2018 when it incorrectly identified the shooter who killed 17 people at Parkland High School, another in 2018 when it retracted a story claiming Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo had a “secret wife,” and a fourth retracting a “third-party” news article that appeared on InfoWars that said the person suspected of killing two people at a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida posted under a specific Reddit username.</p>\n<p>In 2018, social media, video and music streaming services suspended or terminated the accounts of InfoWars and Jones for violating the platforms’ terms of service. On August 5, 2018, Apple confirmed it removed five of InfoWars’ six podcasts from iTunes and its podcast app, citing “hate speech.” The next day, Facebook removed four of Jones’ pages, including the InfoWars page, for repeated offenses, including “glorifying violence” and “using dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants, which violates our hate speech policies.” Facebook said the violations were not related to “false news.” YouTube and Spotify followed suit, kicking several Jones and InfoWars accounts off their platforms shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Exactly a month later, on September 6, Twitter announced it permanently banned Jones and InfoWars for violating the company’s “abusive behavior policy.”  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Infowars.com generally names the writers of its original stories, with links to author biographies. It also hosts a page that lists its editors, correspondents, and reporters, along with biographies. Some of the staff members can be contacted through webforms.</p>\n<p>Advertisements on Infowars.com are clearly labeled. The site also clearly indicates it is owned by Free Speech Systems LLC.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Infowars.com was founded in 1999. In late 2015, then presidential candidate Donald Trump appeared on the Jones’s show and praised the host’s “amazing” reputation. </p>\n<p><em>Corrections: A previous version of this label said that Alex Jones apologized for spreading the Pizzagate conspiracy, when in fact he apologized only for implicating the owner of the Comet Ping Pong restaurant in that conspiracy. A previous version of this label misstated the date that families of the Sandy Hook shooting victims sued Alex Jones; lawsuits were filed in April 2018. Finally, a previous version of this label misidentified the victims of the Parkland High School shooting; 17 people were killed, but not all of those individuals were students.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJosh Keefe\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a
