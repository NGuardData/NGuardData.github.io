The Economist Group sold CQ Roll Call to FiscalNote, the current owner, in a $180 million cash and equity deal announced in July 2018. FiscalNote is a privately run, government-focused technology company based in Washington. The site runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>CQ Roll Call says its mission is to cover “Congress, inside and out” and calls itself the ”only media company that connects policy professionals and opinion leaders with the information and tools they need to understand and influence Congress.” The site’s coverage, from reporters on Roll Call and CQ staffs, is primarily dedicated to news about the federal government and actions in Congress. In addition to traditional news articles and analytical features, RollCall.com includes a guide for congressional elections and personal finance analyses of members of Congress. It produces a podcast, such as an August 2018 episode on congressional moves to expand oversight over social media.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The website publishes correction notices at the bottom of its articles when CQ Roll Call deems them warranted. The site publishes regular articles and elections guides by well-known analysts, while also publishing pieces with the names of its staff authors.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The website links to a CQ Roll Call page listing Roll Call’s newsroom staff, as well as the staff of CQ, which produces and provides separate publications and services. The website provides phone numbers for a newsroom tip line and reporters’ names usually include a link to their Twitter accounts. RollCall.com discloses it is part of FiscalNote.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Onetime congressional staffer Sid Yudain founded Roll Call in 1955 as a community-style newspaper reporting on Capitol Hill, focused on articles about day-to-day actions in Congress and the lives of the people who worked there. Nelson Poynter, a newspaper publisher who also ran the St. Petersburg Times (now Tampa Bay Times) in Florida, created Congressional Quarterly in 1945 with his wife Henrietta, a magazine editor. It was intended to be a service contributing information about Congress to U.S. newspapers, but it grew into a weekly magazine that is still published. Between 1987 and 1993 it was owned and operated by Arthur Levitt Jr., a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange and later chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the husband-wife duo (since divorced) of journalist James Glassman and Mary Glassman, who served as editor and publisher, respectively. It focused on the workings of Congress itself rather than policy issues and broke many stories, most notably that dozens of members of Congress were carrying large overdrafts at the House Bank. The 1990 piece by Tim Burger led to the closing of the bank and the election defeat of many members. Roll Call also provided extensive coverage of the Keating Five savings and loan scandal in which five U.S. senators were accused of improperly intervening on behalf of banker Charles Keating Jr. The Senate Ethics Committee concluded that three had improperly interfered with a Senate investigation, while two displayed “poor judgment.” </p>\n<p>During the same period it also disclosed sexual harassment of female staffers by Jim Bates, a Democratic representative from San Diego. For the first time, the House Ethics Committee in 1989 took disciplinary action against a member for harassment. It moved to “formally and publicly reprove” Bates, who lost re-election to a Republican, \"Duke\" Cunningham (who would later go to prison for taking bribes).</p>\n<p>Roll Call's alumni include Susan Glasser, who started as an intern and later became editor. She became an assistant managing editor at The Washington Post and is now a staff writer with The New Yorker. Glenn Simpson became an investigative reporter at the Wall Street Journal and later founded Fusion GPS, a private research and consulting firm that, with a former British spy, Christopher Steele, detailed possible ties between President Trump, Trump aides and Russian officials.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSam Howard\n\nEdited by:\nJoyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;Jim
