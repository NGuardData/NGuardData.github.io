In February 2018, Dutch news magazine De Groene Amsterdammer reported that the site was hosted by a Dutch citizen named Daan van Seventer. The publication also identified two investors in the site as a real-estate magnate named Erik de Vlieger and an anonymous Dutch businesswoman who described the site as a “business opportunity” and expressed hope it would become “the Breitbart of Europe.”</p>\n<p>The site runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>VoiceOfEurope.com contains short articles about European politics and current affairs. Articles appear in English, with an option to translate them into one of 15 European languages, Russian, or Chinese using an embedded Google Translate tool. The site divides content into Northern, Western, Southern, and Eastern European regions. In the Northern and Western European sections, in particular, articles commonly focus on the perceived social ills of migration, often linking migrants to sex crimes. In the Southern and Eastern European sections, articles commonly highlight the policies, statements, and achievements of hardline conservative governments in countries such as Poland, Hungary, and Italy. </p>\n<p>VoiceOfEurope.com relies heavily on the reporting of other news outlets in Europe, and sometimes republishes articles verbatim, with credit. These include credible outlets, such as Finnish public broadcaster YLE and Italian news agency ANSA, as well as more ideological sites, such as Britain’s Daily Express.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>A NewsGuard review found that while stories on VoiceOfEurope.com are often factually correct, many have apparently been selected because they cast migrants as violent criminals and boost an anti-immigrant agenda. This cherry-picking goes beyond story selection: Headlines and articles often emphasize the ethnicity or religion of alleged criminals, even when there is no evidence that religion or ethnicity is relevant to the incident in question.</p>\n<p>One recent headline, for example, read “Five Mohammeds and others charged for abusing girls as young as 12 in Huddersfield, UK.” An August 2018 article about arson attacks in Sweden stated that the attacks occurred in an area that is home to “well known Islamic State fighters.” The article, however, links to news reports by Swedish public broadcaster SVT and The Associated Press that say nothing about any suspected Islamic State involvement in the arsons. The AP article noted that police have pursued drug dealers in the neighborhood and said no motive in the arsons had been established. </p>\n<p>While some posts on VoiceOfEurope.com merely reproduce other sites’ credible news reporting, others contain opinionated language, although the articles are not labeled opinion. In a September 2018 article headlined: “Failing mayor of London now calls for second Brexit referendum,” the site wrote: “Perhaps instead of wasting his time writing articles attempting to overturn democratic decisions made by the people, [London Mayor Sadiq] Khan should focus on his own problems.”</p>\n<p>An article from December 2017, about the leaking of government crime data in Sweden --  including the names, locations, charges, and prison sentences for criminal defendants -- concludes: “Sweden rather keep its migrant crime data away from the public eye: Publishing migrant crimes is a ‘bigger problem’ than the crimes themselves. While a lot of people all over the world already know what is really happening in the country, its politicians prefer to avoid reality.” </p>\n<p>Although Voice of Europe describes itself as “conservative” on its Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube pages, the site itself states only that it is “uncensored news,” without disclosing its political orientation or making any distinction between news and opinion content. Because Voice of Europe does not disclose its political orientation, cherry-picks stories that give an overwhelmingly negative impression of migrants based on anecdotal examples, and leaves out details that would call into question whether the alleged criminal’s ethnicity is relevant, NewsGuard has concluded that VoiceOfEurope.com does not gathers and present information responsibly and does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>VoiceOfEurope.com does not articulate a corrections policy, and NewsGuard could find no evidence the site issues corrections.</p>\n<p>While typically credited, images are sometimes selected and edited to reinforce a political agenda, particularly when illustrating articles about migrants’ alleged crimes. Many of these articles play into racial tropes about crime. For example, the December 2017 article about the Swedish crime data is illustrated with a stock image of a black man in a balaclava pinning down a white woman, who appears to have blood on her shirt.  </p>\n<p>Two NewsGuard emails to Voice of Europe seeking comment about its editorial standards, approach to corrections, and how it distinguishes between news and opinion were not answered.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>VoiceOfEurope.com does not disclose its ownership or financing or the identity of its editorial staff. Article bylines are commonly generic (e.g., “Voice of Europe”) or pseudonyms. The Contact page features a general contact form.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are clearly labeled.</p>\n<p>Two NewsGuard emails to Voice of Europe seeking comment on its lack of disclosure about site owners, leaders, and content creators drew no response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>VoiceOfEurope.com was first registered in 2002. The oldest article NewsGuard could find on the site dates to July 2017.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJon Allsop\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Eric
