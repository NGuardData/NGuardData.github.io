Utah businessman Paul Huntsman remains the owner and publisher.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Sltrib.com primarily republishes material from the print version of the Tribune. Coverage includes news, sports, opinion, religion, and lifestyle content. National and international news articles are often pulled from reliable external sources, most frequently The Washington Post and The Associated Press. </p>\n<p>The site also offers some multimedia content not available in print, such as podcasts and videos. Popular video content, which is also available on the Tribune’s YouTube page, includes footage of controversial police interactions and coverage of the Sundance film festival.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Tribune has won two Pulitzer Prizes. The first was the 1957 prize for Breaking News Reporting, for its coverage of the crash of two airliners over the Grand Canyon, in which 128 persons were killed. The second, awarded sixty years later, was for a series on sexual assault at Brigham Young University that won the 2017 prize for Local Reporting.</p>\n<p>No explicit corrections policy is listed on the site, but articles initially published with errors are corrected with explanations at the bottom of updated pages.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Ownership is indicated on the site. The website has a comprehensive staff list that discloses the editorial leadership structure. The list links to individual author pages that include photos, biographical information, social media and email links, and lists of bylined articles.</p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored content are clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Founded in 1871 by three excommunicated Mormons, the paper spent its first decades mired in conflict with the Mormon Church. In 1901, U.S. Senator Thomas Kearns purchased the Tribune, seeking to modernize the paper and make its reporting more objective. His heirs held ownership for nearly a century.</p>\n<p>In 1952, the Tribune and the Mormon Church-owned Deseret News signed a joint operating agreement to form an independent entity called the Newspaper Agency Corporation, which later became the Utah Media Group. The two papers remain editorially independent and competitive. The sltrib.com domain was registered in 1994, with digital archives available going back to 1990.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nGrace Niewijk\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/history-mission/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sltrib.com/history-mission/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/0071180D:US-newspaper-agency-corp\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/0071180D:US-newspaper-agency-corp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mediaoneutah.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mediaoneutah.com/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://utahmediagroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://utahmediagroup.com/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/sltrib/videos?sort=p&view=0&flow=grid\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/user/sltrib/videos?sort=p&#x26;view=0&#x26;flow=grid </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/30/us/2-utah-reporters-fired-for-role-in-tabloid-s-kidnapping-article.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/30/us/2-utah-reporters-fired-for-role-in-tabloid-s-kidnapping-article.html </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/02/us/editor-in-abduction-case-quits.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/02/us/editor-in-abduction-case-quits.html </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/staff/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sltrib.com/staff/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/sltrib.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.whois.com/whois/sltrib.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=51988624&itype=CMSID\" target=\"_blank\">http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=51988624&#x26;itype=CMSID </a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"sltrib.com","author":"Grace Niewijk","date":"2018-08-06T20:57:51.651+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/sltrib.com/"}}
