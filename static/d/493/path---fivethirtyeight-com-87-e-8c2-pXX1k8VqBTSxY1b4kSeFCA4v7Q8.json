Disney also is the primary owner of ESPN.</p>\n<p>The site earns revenue from advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content </h3>\n<p>FiveThirtyEight uses numbers- and statistics-based information to report on politics and a variety of current events.</p>\n<p>The website features opinion polls and extensive databases on topics such as gender politics, public support for elected officials, and Russian election-meddling.</p>\n<p>In the runup to the 2018 midterm elections, the site is focusing efforts and articles on House of Representatives races, which will be crucial in determining which party controls the chamber.</p>\n<p>The Science and Health section regularly publishes stories about the politically charged topic of climate change, and provides interactive maps with data sets.</p>\n<p>Economics stories cover diverse topics, including pay gaps between men and women, student loans, and President Donald Trump’s tariffs.</p>\n<p>FiveThirtyEight also publishes regular segments, such as Significant Digits, which are news snippets that use numbers to tell a brief story. The subjects range widely, touching on overdose deaths, how fast Jakarta is sinking, and how an 11-year-old boy hacked into a replica of Florida’s election website in mere minutes. In addition, the website rates the accuracy of other pollsters.</p>\n<p>A multi-part series published in 2017 sought to explain Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton. Titled “The Real Story of 2016,” it included a story by Silver, with the headline “There Really Was a Liberal Bubble,” in which he wrote that, “Groupthink produced a failure of the ‘wisdom of the crowds,’ and an underestimate of Trump’s chances.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Headlines on FiveThirtyEight are straightforward and factual. Content is written by a staff that includes data-trained journalists.</p>\n<p>Stories regularly feature balanced, original reporting, and consistently sources information from publications such as The Washington Post, and The New York Times.</p>\n<p>FiveThirtyEight uses its own methodology to interpret statistics, and provides links to data it uses.</p>\n<p>The website also writes analyses of predictions it gets wrong, such as the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the 2015 U.K. general election.</p>\n<p>Since its inception, FiveThirtyEight’s in-depth reporting and polling have won praise from numerous publications and institutions.</p>\n<p>In 2008, it became the first blog to be selected as a Notable Narrative by the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University. In 2016, it was named Data Journalism Website of the Year by the Global Editors Network, a Paris-based organization that promotes innovation in newsrooms around the world. FiveThirtyEight has also won two Webby Awards. </p>\n<p>FiveThirtyEight does not provide a visible corrections policy on its website, but it does regularly correct errors in its reporting. The website did not reply to NewsGuard’s two emails seeking comment on why it does not state its corrections policy.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>FiveThirtyEight names its writers and provides information about many of them.</p>\n<p>The website also features a masthead that lists its editors and senior staff, but many lack biographical information.</p>\n<p>Advertising is clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Silver founded FiveThirtyEight in 2008 as a polling aggregation blog. He named the site for the number of electors in the U.S. electoral college.</p>\n<p>The New York Times acquired the website in 2010. ESPN took it over in 2013, and then ABC in 2018.</p>\n<p>In 2009, The Times called Silver a “wunderkind,” and Time Magazine named him one of the World’s 100 Most Influential People after he correctly predicted the outcome of the 2008 U.S. presidential election in 49 out of 50 states, missing only  Barack Obama’s Indiana win. He has yet to duplicate that feat.</p>\n<p>Silver was first recognized for developing the Player Empirical Comparison and Optimization Test Algorithm, or, PECOTA, a system for forecasting the performance and career development of Major League Baseball players. Silver, an avid baseball fan, sees similarities between sports and politics.</p>\n<p>Politics “reminded me of baseball, when you see the same recycled clichés and conventional wisdoms over and over again, some of which isn’t very wise,” he told the magazine of the University of Chicago, his alma mater, in 2009.</p>\n<p>In 2007, while Silver was still working on PECOTA, he began publishing a diary under the pseudonym “Poblan” on the political blog Daily Kos. He revealed his identity shortly after creating FiveThirtyEight.com. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nPeggy Ackermann&#x26;emsp;Joyce
