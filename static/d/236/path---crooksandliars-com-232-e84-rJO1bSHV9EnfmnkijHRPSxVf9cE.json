It is financed through display advertisements, as well as reader donations, which it solicits at the bottom of pages.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Crooksandliars.com calls itself a website for “progressive news and media criticism.” Most content is critical of conservative politicians and public figures. A typical example came after President Donald Trump angered many people on the mainland and in Puerto Rico by disputing the death toll in the U.S. commonwealth from Hurricane Maria. Republican strategist Ed Rollins appeared on a September 2018 “Lou Dobbs Tonight” segment that was broadcast on the Fox Business Network and dismissed Puerto Ricans in general as “not for us anyways.” In response, Crooks and Liars wrote: “Who could have imagined that anyone, even on Fox News, even on the Lou Dobbs show, could take Trump’s tweets denying the death toll from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, and make it worse? Ed Rollins did it.”</p>\n<p>The website’s primary sections are CLTV (Crooks and Liars TV), Politics, Media Bites, Entertainment, and Sports. A main feature in August and September 2018 was the Mueller Files, which chronicled the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p>\n<p>Posts generally aggregate clips from TV news broadcasts, screenshots of popular Tweets, and block quotes from news articles. Authors intersperse liberal commentary into that content. For example, the site posted an August 2018 tweet from President Trump, along with the author’s observation: “Here we go again: Trump rage-tweeting on a Monday morning!” Most content is written in a casual tone, with authors frequently expressing outrage at the actions of conservative media and politicians.</p>\n<p>The majority of posts are original to Crooks and Liars, but some are pulled from similar liberal blogs, such as No More Mister Nice Blog, and established news outlets, such as the investigative nonprofit ProPublica.</p>\n<p>The site is also affiliated with Blue America PAC, a political action committee dedicated to replacing the “conservative consensus in Congress.” Blue America’s site is housed at a separate URL, blueamerica.crooksandliars.com. Many posts on Blue America’s site appear on crooksandliars.com. Amato told NewsGuard that the PAC is run independently from Crooks and Liars.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Posts are responsibly sourced, and claims are supported with video clips, Twitter screenshots, and quotes from reputable news outlets such as The Associated Press. Other content, however, is published directly from similar liberal blogs, such as Newshounds.us, a site that regularly criticizes Fox News. Asked how Crooks and Liars vets this outside content, Amato told NewsGuard, “We only cross-post articles that we fact-check, and that we know are accurate and reality-based.”</p>\n<p>Crooks and Liars makes clear that it is an opinion site with a liberal perspective. The site generally does not misstate or egregiously distort facts in presenting opinion, but there have been instances when it does.</p>\n<p>In an August 2018 article detailing how Trump allegedly laundered Russian money through his real estate properties, the author concluded, “The collusion and conspiracies are right here in front of us. We have a Russian agent in the White House.” The story provided no evidence of Trump being “a Russian agent.” Another August 2018 story speculated that Melania Trump uses a stunt double, an assertion that has been widely discredited. The Crooks and Liars article posted grainy images and videos of the first lady and wrote, “GUYS, THAT IS NOT MELANIA!” Because of its mixing of fact and opinion, NewsGuard concluded the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>Headlines are generally representative of stories, sometimes mimicking the tone of the author. September 2018 stories included “Illinois Republicans Try To Distance Themselves From Trump” and “He’s Baaack! George W. Bush Campaigning For Republicans, Except Ted Cruz.”</p>\n<p>Although the majority of headlines are straightforward, occasionally they are sensationalized. The fact-checking site Snopes criticized Crooks and Liars for an April 2017 headline that made the claim, “Jeff Sessions Getting Rich Filling Private Prisons.” Snopes pointed out, and an independent NewsGuard review confirmed, that the claim was based on Sessions having holdings in two mutual funds that include investments in private prisons. But, as Snopes noted, the funds are widely diversified, and changes in the value of individual stocks related to prisons likely would hardly affect their overall performance, much less help Sessions “get rich.” When NewsGuard asked why the story was not updated with the Snopes finding, Amato said Crooks and Liars had not been aware of it. The site then amended the story with this notice: “UPDATE 9/17/2018 It has come to our attention that Snopes.com has an issue with the conclusions in this post, though they do not dispute the facts. Fundamentally, their issue is with the assertion that Sessions is ‘getting rich’ through an investment in mutual funds containing large investments in private prison companies GEO and CoreCivic. They argue that these funds are well-diversified funds and therefore the gains from private prisons would be a negligible part of the larger portfolio.”</p>\n<p>The site adheres to a corrections policy, which Amato provided to NewsGuard. The policy is not posted on the website. “While we strive for error-free content, we are committed to corrections in a timely fashion,” the policy states. “Corrections are promptly made with a notation inside the body of the post and a notice that the post has been updated. On the rare occasion that we get it completely wrong, we pull the post from our front page, correct the headline, and note at the top that it was based upon an erroneous report.” Apart from corrections, many posts feature editor’s notes that merely contain further commentary by the author.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>T</h3>\n<p>The website names owner Amato on an About Us page and his biography page. The About Us page also provides biographies for the managing editor, associate editor, and webmaster. A Contact Us page provides Amato’s email address, and an address for general inquiries.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are labeled.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard concluded Crooks and Liars does not provide information about all of its content providers. The bottom of every page contains the site’s physical address and its staff masthead, but four of the eight contributors use pseudonyms, such as “LeftOfCenter,” and one is only identified as “David.” Amato told NewsGuard in a telephone interview that some authors use pen names to protect their identities and avoid online abuse. Some articles list writers’ full names and biographies, but others give only their first name or pseudonym.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Amato launched Crooks and Liars in September 2004. He told Axios he started the site because he thought that mainstream media wasn't critical enough of the Bush administration, and he felt motivated to speak out. Time magazine included the site on a 2009 list of the 25 best blogs, and noted its early use of video clips, known as “vlogging,” before YouTube became popular.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written
