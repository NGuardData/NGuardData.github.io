Michael Bloomberg, who served as a Republican and Independent mayor of New York City from 2002 through 2013, is the company’s majority owner. Bloomberg L.P. receives most of its revenue from selling subscriptions to the Bloomberg terminal, a software system that provides access to financial data and news. The news service sells its content to other media outlets. Bloomberg.com runs advertisements and charges for digital subscriptions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Bloomberg News publishes thousands of business stories daily from global financial capitals.  The site publishes news and provides data on a wide range of sectors, including stocks, bonds, and commodities. Economic coverage features extensive reporting on global markets, with dedicated sections for exchange-traded funds and fixed income investments. Bloomberg.com publishes consumer and investor-focused stories, such as “Where to Invest $10,000” and “What’s Inside All the iPhones.”  In addition to written stories, visitors to the site can watch video features such as Bloomberg Daybreak: Americas, a show which provides market-specific news and business analysis. Visitors can also stream different podcasts, such as Odd Lots, which provides weekly analysis and commentary on hot topics in finance and economics. </p>\n<p>In addition to financial reporting, Bloomberg.com publishes stories about politics, including broad coverage of Brexit, and features such as Trump Tracker, which logs news about U.S. President Donald Trump. Bloomberg.com’s technology section provides coverage of startups, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. The site publishes opinion and editorials, as well as a Pursuits section that reports on lifestyle topics, culture, and travel. Beyond the U.S., Bloomberg publishes international editions from Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, as well as a Japanese-language edition. Visitors to the site can also watch Bloomberg TV broadcasts and find reporting from Bloomberg Businessweek, a weekly print publication. The magazine’s 2018 covers included a photo of a chicken and the headline, “Chickens Rejoice!” for a look at how Tyson Foods Inc., which produces one of every five pounds of meat consumed in the United States, is investing heavily in animal-free alternatives. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Bloomberg provides balanced, fact-based, and originally reported stories that regularly include multiple sources and offer diverse perspectives. According to its own figures, Bloomberg produces 5,000 stories a day in more than 120 countries. </p>\n<p>Bloomberg News has won numerous awards for journalistic excellence. In 2015, journalist Zachary Mider won the Pulitzer Prize for “Tax Runaways,” a series that investigated how some U.S. corporations dodged taxes. In 2013, Bloomberg News won two George Polk Awards for “Indentured Students,” a series on abuses in higher education finance, and for a series that documented the identities and giant financial holdings of China’s political elite.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg has been lauded for its digital innovation, as well. Bloomberg’s TicToc, a global news network built for Twitter, was named editorial innovation of 2018 and awarded the grand prix at The Drum Online Media Awards. The Drum also lauded Bloomberg for having the social media team of the year, citing the publication’s embrace of social media storytelling through use of Twitter Moments, Instagram Stories, and Facebook.</p>\n<p>While Bloomberg has a well-earned reputation for quality, factual journalism, it has inspired controversy.  </p>\n<p>In 2013, The New York Times reported that Bloomberg stopped the publication of a story critical of the Chinese government to avoid censorship and a loss of business. The Times reported that Bloomberg’s then-editor-in-chief, Matthew Winkler, told Asia-based staff that publishing the report would threaten the news organization’s ability to report from the country. After the Times reported the controversy, Bloomberg’s lead reporter on the story, Michael Forsythe, was suspended, and then left Bloomberg. An Asia-based editor resigned later in protest. Winkler told the Times that the stories “are active” and had not been killed. Forsythe went to work for The New York Times, where he has regularly had similar stories published.</p>\n<p>That same year, The Times also revealed that Bloomberg reporters had been trained to glean subscriber information from Bloomberg’s data terminals in an attempt to gain an advantage in reporting, a practice that had reportedly gone on for many years. Winkler wrote an editorial in which he apologized for the practices, writing “Our reporters should not have access to any data considered proprietary. I am sorry they did. The error is inexcusable.”</p>\n<p>Bloomberg does not state its corrections policy, but it does make corrections, which are noted at the bottom of articles in italics, with a description of what was changed.  Headlines on the site are straightforward and reflect the content. Opinion content is clearly distinguished from news by dedicated sections.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Bloomberg.com names the authors of stories, but its practices for providing information about them appear to be inconsistent. Readers can sometimes find links to authors’ social media profiles; some journalists, including opinion columnists, have biographical information on the site. But in many cases, the site offers neither biographical nor contact information for its writers.  </p>\n<p>Regarding the lack of information about many reporters, Bloomberg told NewsGuard that it re-launched Bloomberg.com in May 2018 and was continuing to experiment with features on the site. Bloomberg said that more information about writers can be found on Bloomberg Terminal, the company’s leading product, which also publishes more news than Bloomberg.com. </p>\n<p>Bloomberg News has a policy to not report on itself as a company or on its owner. It omits Michael Bloomberg, one of the world’s richest people, from its own ranking of billionaires. Opinion essays and sponsored content are clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>In 1981, Michael Bloomberg founded Innovative Market Systems, which sold computer terminals that provided financial data to Wall Street firms. The company was later renamed Bloomberg L.P.</p>\n<p>The news service was launched by Bloomberg and Winkler in 1990. The site was registered in 1993.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
