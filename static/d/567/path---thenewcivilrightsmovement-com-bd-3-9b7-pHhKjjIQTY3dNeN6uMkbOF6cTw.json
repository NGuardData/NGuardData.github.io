Badash sold the site to AlterNet Media Inc., a Miami-based private company that also runs the liberal news site AlterNet.org. Former Boston Globe reporter John Byrne and gay rights activist Michael Rogers co-own AlterNet Media. Another of their companies, Raw Story Media Inc., owns the liberal news website RawStory.com. Byrne founded and runs the Miami-based nonprofit Prevention305, which promotes HIV education and access to an HIV-prevention drug. The website generates revenue through advertisements.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Thenewcivilrightsmovement.com offers fact-based stories, mostly from other, reliable websites, on LGBT and civil rights issues. The site extensively covered the 2010 repeal of the federal “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” statute for the armed forces, thus allowing gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military, and the efforts to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act during President Barack Obama’s tenure. The site continues its LGBT advocacy during the administration of President Donald Trump, while adding immigration, census and other policy issues to its agenda.</p>\n<p>The website is divided into categories including Trump's America, This is Clearly Discrimination, Religious Extremism, and Lies and the Lying Liars That Tell Them. On a typical day, thenewcivilrightsmovement.com features articles about a Pittsburgh protest against Trump’s visit there soon after the 2018 synagogue massacre; Trump’s suggestions about the need to end birthright citizenship; and a Trump administration memo proposing to redefine gender as a person’s sex at birth. The site challenged the constitutionality of appointing Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general after Jeff Sessions’ forced resignation. </p>\n<p>Many articles are short takes on the news or roundups of social media reactions. The site occasionally publishes editorials and op-eds from guest writers. It often reposts articles from liberal news sites, including Raw Story and AlterNet. Badash writes much of the website’s original content. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The website discloses its purpose as an advocate, describing itself as a voice \"for progressives, the LGBT community, and other underrepresented minorities in the country.\" It uses reliable media and social media sources, such as CNN, Fox, and The Washington Post, and links to source material in aggregated articles. “We absolutely and unapologetically report the news from a progressive viewpoint, but we are also assiduously factual,” Badash told NewsGuard. “Our work is well-sourced and generally based on multiple, highly credible sources. We also provide our readers links to those sources when it is not original reporting.”</p>\n<p>Badash told NewsGuard that he tries to contact opponents for comment and supplied examples. In one case, he elicited comment from the office of Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) on the congressman’s plan to be the keynote speaker at a Bible conference in Washington, D.C. The gathering was hosted by Kevin Swanson, a pastor who has defended Uganda’s since-abandoned proposal to execute gays. Johnson said he had been unaware of the pastor’s views on the proposal, and canceled his appearance.</p>\n<p>Thenewcivilrightsmovement.com, however, inserts opinionated language into some stories. Because of this, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. A September 2018 article titled \"Hypocritical Conservatives Mercilessly Mocked for Destroying Their Own Nike Apparel to Protest Kaepernick\" begins: \"Conservatives are once again proving their ignorance and hypocrisy.\" The site frequently uses terms like “fascism” to describe Trump and his administration. In addition, headlines on those stories are sensationalized, such as \"Dogwhistle: Racist President Retweets Racist Congressman’s Fake Racist Video\" and \"Pat McCrory Failed at Being a Governor. Now He’s Succeeding at Being a Racist.\" Businessman McCrory was a one-term North Carolina governor.</p>\n<p>“We're unapologetically coming from a progressive point of view,” Badash explained. “But we try to give readers context and background.”</p>\n<p>The New Civil Rights Movement has one unproven claim cited by the fact-checking website Snopes. Thenewcivilrightsmovement.com alleged that in August 2016, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump gave money to anti-gay activists in the guise of donating to flood relief. Trump wrote a $100,000 personal check to the Greenwell Springs Baptist Church in Louisiana, where Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, was serving as interim pastor. The check was voided, so it is inconclusive whether Trump actually made the donation. If he did, it is inconclusive whether the funds were used for purposes other than flood relief.</p>\n<p>The website does not have a posted corrections policy, but it publishes corrections at the bottom of stories, and includes an explanation of the mistake. The site includes an email address at the end of each story for readers seeking corrections. The About page also includes an email link for corrections.</p>\n<p>In 2014, thenewcivilrightsmovement.com won a GLAAD Media Award from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation for best blog.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site's About page states that it is owned by AlterNet Media and links to the company’s website.</p>\n<p>Stories include an email link for the editor at the bottom of the text. Author names appear on articles and link to the writers’ other stories on the site. Most do not link to contact information. Biographies are included for the website’s contributing editors, who also are frequent content providers, on a masthead on the About page. Op-eds written by guest contributors include a short biography of the author. Badash said that in addition to his email address, the site posts political correspondent Brody Levesque’s email “because of the nature of his work for us.” </p>\n<p>“We don’t post email addresses for other members of the team, but there is clearly an email address at the bottom of each article that goes directly to me,” he added. “That email address is also clearly displayed on our About page.”</p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored content are distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Thenewcivilrightsmovement.com was founded in 2008 by Badash, a gay-rights advocate and blogger. Coverage expanded to include topics beyond same-sex marriage, including politics and race. Badash sold the site to AlterNet in 2018 and remained editor in chief. </p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: NewsGuard has updated this label to correct an error in originally giving </em><em>the website</em><em> a red “X” for not identifying content providers.
