Brown and his late wife, Lina Newhouser, in 1997, Common Dreams remains a nonprofit 501(c)3 newsroom. Brown, who has worked as a Democratic consultant, is the site’s editor. The site says “in order to ensure our independence, we accept no corporate or governmental financing or advertisements of any kind. Common Dreams is funded by the pooling together of thousands of small donations from our readers.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Common Dreams covers a wide variety of topics, including climate change, labor and economic rights, and politics. The main menu allows users to navigate among topics including World, US, Canada, Climate, Economy, Rights, Solutions, and War &#x26; Peace. Opinion pieces are listed in the Views section.</p>\n<p>The site’s liberal perspective and agenda are disclosed in its About section: “Common Dreams has been providing breaking news &#x26; views for the progressive community since 1997.” Its news coverage reflects that perspective.</p>\n<p>The homepage features a Progressive Newswire, with press releases from activist organizations and nonprofits, such as Amnesty International and Friends of the Earth, as well as some liberal politicians and candidates. Common Dreams also cites articles from other news outlets, such as The Philadelphia Inquirer, Daily Kos, and The Associated Press. The site is especially known for its anti-war leanings. Between 2002 and 2003, the website sold hundreds of thousands of anti-Iraq war bumper stickers. During the 1998-99 war in Kosovo, it had a special section called the Drumbeats of War.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles generally cite and link to well-known news agencies, such as ProPublica, CNN, the Washington Post, and ABC News. Numerous articles that reference credible news outlets also contain a clear opinion and are not placed under the website’s Views section. For example, a July 2018 piece on the Trump administration’s family separation policy was titled, “Monsters Inc: Ripping Brown Kids from Their Families Is ‘One of the Great Acts of American Generosity.’” </p>\n<p>Although reporting is generally fact-based, opinion appears in unlabeled news articles.  </p>\n<p>A July 2018 story, \"What Trump Hath Wrought\" began, \"We were already freaked out by the unhinged, hate-filled spectacle of the Tampa brawl, with its jeering, frenzied, cretinous mobs holding bonkers signs …” Another story referred to John Bolton, national security adviser, as a “warmonger.” </p>\n<p>In addition to its staff, Common Dreams has a network of contributors who write for its Views section. The site also publishes columns attributed to authors including Naomi Klein, filmmaker Michael Moore, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Readers are allowed to submit unpaid opinion articles or press releases. The site did not respond to a NewsGuard email asking whether it edits the contributors’ submissions.</p>\n<p>The site does not have a stated corrections policy, but a NewsGuard review found examples of recent corrections, which usually appear at the end of stories, describing the error in the story and the correct information.</p>\n<p>Common Dreams did not respond to two NewsGuard emails asking about its corrections policy and how the site differentiates news and opinion.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site lists a Portland, Maine, mailing address and general phone number. Contact and biographical information for leadership and staff members is available on the Key Staff page.</p>\n<p>Common Dreams clearly discloses its ownership and a history of the nonprofit. It does not disclose the names of the donors that finance it, although it says that the thousands of individuals only give small amounts to the site.</p>\n<p>Common Dreams articles generally name the writer, including the author’s position at Common Dreams. Images are clearly attributed.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Before founding Common Dreams, Craig Brown was a Democratic political consultant and chief of staff to former Maine Congressman Tom Andrews. </p>\n<p>The site was created in 1997.</p>\n<p><em>Corrections: An earlier version of this label incorrectly reported the number of bumper stickers that CommonDreams.org said it sold between 2002 and 2003 to protest the Iraq War. The site sold hundreds of thousands of stickers. An earlier version of this label also incorrectly reported that writer Naomi Klein, filmmaker Michael Moore, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders contribute writing to CommonDreams.org. The site instead republished their writing or speeches from other sources.</em></p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This Nutrition Label has been updated and the rating has changed to reflect that CommonDreams.org does regularly publish corrections.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nVittoria Elliott\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/203368194/201742229349300719/IRS990\" target=\"_blank\">https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/203368194/201742229349300719/IRS990</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/about-us\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.commondreams.org/about-us</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/donate\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.commondreams.org/donate</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/writers-guidelines\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.commondreams.org/writers-guidelines</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/kosovo2/305849.stm\" target=\"_blank\">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/kosovo2/305849.stm</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/further/2018/07/11/monsters-inc-ripping-brown-kids-their-families-one-great-acts-american-generosity\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.commondreams.org/further/2018/07/11/monsters-inc-ripping-brown-kids-their-families-one-great-acts-american-generosity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/views/2018/05/02/who-real-nuclear-threat\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.commondreams.org/views/2018/05/02/who-real-nuclear-threat</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/06/29/new-study-warns-deepwater-horizon-disaster-long-lasting-impact-marine-lifes-building\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/06/29/new-study-warns-deepwater-horizon-disaster-long-lasting-impact-marine-lifes-building</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/07/30/koch-funded-hit-piece-backfires-shows-medicare-all-would-save-300-billion-over-ten\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/07/30/koch-funded-hit-piece-backfires-shows-medicare-all-would-save-300-billion-over-ten</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/05/03/nbc-sources-allege-feds-monitored-cohens-phone-and-picked-least-one-call-trump-white\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/05/03/nbc-sources-allege-feds-monitored-cohens-phone-and-picked-least-one-call-trump-white</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/10/12/outrageous-voter-suppression-cowardly-republicans-georgia-part-nationwide-gop-attack\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/10/12/outrageous-voter-suppression-cowardly-republicans-georgia-part-nationwide-gop-attack</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/key-staff\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.commondreams.org/key-staff</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/about-us\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.commondreams.org/about-us</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20091225045819/http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/106749.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.archive.org/web/20091225045819/http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/106749.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bangordailynews.com/2014/09/29/politics/attorney-asks-court-to-sentence-portland-woman-to-work-with-former-congressman/\" target=\"_blank\">https://bangordailynews.com/2014/09/29/politics/attorney-asks-court-to-sentence-portland-woman-to-work-with-former-congressman/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://whois.domaintools.com/commondreams.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://whois.domaintools.com/commondreams.org</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"commondreams.org","author":"Vittoria Elliott","date":"2018-11-13T19:37:06.842+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/commondreams.org/"}}
