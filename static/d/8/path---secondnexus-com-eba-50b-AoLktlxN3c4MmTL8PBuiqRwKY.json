The Social Edge sells its content to publishers of social media channels and to social media influencers. Oh Myyy LLC owns and operates several social media pages and websites that publish light-hearted internet and pop cultural news, supervised by a team that oversees Takei’s social media operations. SecondNexus.com runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Second Nexus says in a mission statement that it “explores humanity’s outlook as we hurtle toward a new and unknown future…. Second Nexus aims to raise the level, and the tone, of the conversation.” (Nexus refers to a coming together or focal point.)</p>\n<p>Content on Second Nexus is selected to drive the maximum number of page views, according to The Social Edge (the marketing firm that is co-owner of the site), which says it filters over 1,000 articles a day and selects stories for publication that are believed to have the best chance of going viral.</p>\n<p>SecondNexus.com’s home page divides content into sections including news, entertainment, the environment, LGBT, and science. Political stories focus on the Trump administration and are consistently critical of Trump and his policies. The site’s news section has a separate area on Trump, and another on advocacy, featuring topics such as transgender rights and family separation at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>\n<p>SecondNexus.com stories often include popular tweets and video clips from other news sources. Stories have short subheads designed to be easily shared on social media. A subhead on an August 2018 story on the indictment of Republican Rep. Chris Collins on securities fraud charges, for example, reads “Only the best people.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Second Nexus does not produce original reporting, and instead packages posts from other outlets, including major television networks and The Associated Press. The site has a separate opinion section, but opinionated stories also appear as news content. </p>\n<p>The site’s about page describes its political perspective as “progressive,” and stories and headlines are often infused with a liberal slant. However, because the site does not regularly misstate or distort facts, while revealing its political orientation, NewsGuard has determined that Secondnexus.com meets the standard for handling the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>An article in August 2018 about former White House aide Omarosa Manigault-Newman’s claim that she witnessed Trump’s “mental decline,” for example, embedded a tweet that said, “Either the entire world has seen evidence of @realDonaldTrump’s mental decline or he has always been a #moron.” The author added his own tweet, which read, “The world has gotten the hint...”</p>\n<p>A news story about the Trump administration’s immigration policies included the statement, “The administration’s ire toward unauthorized immigrants seems to be devoid of moral limits.”</p>\n<p>No corrections could be found on the site, except for one that was added -- three months after the original article appeared and after NewsGuard asked about it. In April 2018, the site posted an article titled, “Donald Trump’s Decision to Withdraw From the TPP Caused Harley Davidson Plant in Missouri to Close and Move to Thailand.” In fact, Harley said the plant was closed because of decreasing demand, not because of President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. The Second Nexus article was based on a tweet by Bloomberg News that was corrected later that day.</p>\n<p>Jay Kuo, chief operating officer of The Social Edge, acknowledged in an email to NewsGuard that “the underlying [Bloomberg] piece was not reviewed for accuracy.” Kuo called the mistake a “process error on our part,” adding, “We have addressed this process error internally.”</p>\n<p>SecondNexus.com issued a corrections policy in the summer of 2018, saying it “welcomes complaints about errors and will issue corrections where warranted.” However, because the site still has not apparently issued any corrections other than the one related to Harley Davidson and has not indicated how it vets tweets and content before it publishes posts based on them, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not currently have effective practices for publishing clarifications and corrections.</p>\n<p>Kuo, in an email to NewsGuard, wrote that readers have never asked for a correction on SecondNexus. “This lack of correction requests may largely be because we do not generally do original reporting” Kuo said, “and instead rely on fully reputable sources for our news digests, such as Bloomberg, The New York Times, and the AP.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>All articles on Secondnexus.com include the name of the writer. The site’s contributors, writers, and leaders, are listed on its contact page, along with email addresses.</p>\n<p>The site’s About page discloses its ownership by Oh Myyy LLC as well as that company’s relationship with The Social Edge.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are clearly distinguished from news content. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Secondnexus.com was registered in February 2014. Other viral news sites in the same organization include knowable.com, guacamoley.com, comicsands.com, and percolately.com. </p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This Nutrition Label has been updated to reflect changes implemented to Oh Myyy LLC’s websites in September 2018, which included adding disclosures about its political orientation and its ownership. As a result, the site now meets NewsGuard’s standards for handling the difference between news and opinion responsibly and for providing information about its ownership.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJeremy Binckes\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
