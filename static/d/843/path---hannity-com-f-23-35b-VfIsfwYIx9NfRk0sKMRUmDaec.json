The country’s largest owner of broadcast radio stations, iHeartMedia filed for bankruptcy in March 2018. The site is not affiliated with Fox News, which airs Hannity’s television show.</p>\n<p>Hannity.com runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Hannity.com calls itself “The home for all things Sean Hannity.” The site features a live stream of Sean Hannity’s radio show and publishes a podcast version of the show after it airs. The site also publishes short news posts, which are often summaries of stories published in conservative outlets like the Daily Caller and Fox News, where Hannity hosts his popular television show. The site’s anonymous authors will also write stories based on social media posts and government actions, including executive orders and Supreme Court decisions.</p>\n<p>The site hosts community message boards where users discuss news subjects. Advertising is clearly distinct from editorial content. Occasionally, a post responding to news about Hannity will be written from a first-person perspective. For example, after it was revealed in court that Hannity had been a client of Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen, Hannity.com published a post that read: “Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter. I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Hannity uses his radio show, which livestreams on Hannity.com, to defend the president and attack liberals, Democrats, and the media. He often declares “journalism is dead” on the air.</p>\n<p>On his radio show in 2016, Hannity said, “I’m not a journalist. I’m a talk show host.” Hannity told the New York Times in 2016 that he “never claimed to be a journalist,” but later said, “I’m a journalist… But I’m an advocacy journalist, or an opinion journalist.”</p>\n<p>That opinion is almost always in lockstep with Trump, a friend of Hannity’s. The Washington Post and New York Magazine have reported that the two men have near-daily phone calls, during which Hannity serves as an outside adviser to the president. Former deputy Trump campaign manager David Bossie said Trump sees Hannity as “as an incredibly smart and articulate spokesman for the agenda.”</p>\n<p>A November 2017 analysis by news site Vox.com found that Hannity’s invoking of conspiracy theories spiked around two events seen as politically damaging to Trump: when Trump fired FBI Director James Comey and when former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was indicted as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe. </p>\n<p>Court proceedings in 2018 revealed Hannity and Trump were both clients of attorney Cohen, whom Hannity defended on his show without disclosing that Cohen represented him. The omission drew widespread criticism, including from some of Hannity’s Fox News colleagues.</p>\n<p>Hannity has given time on his radio shows to airing conspiracy theories, including the claim that President Barack Obama was born outside the United States and that a Democratic National Committee staffer, Seth Rich, was murdered for leaking internal Democratic Party documents to WikiLeaks. Both theories have been widely debunked.</p>\n<p>Hannity and Hannity.com sometimes omit key facts to push a preferred narrative. For example, on July 17, 2018, Hannity.com published a post containing the opening monologue from Hannity’s Fox News show, which aired shortly after Trump held a joint press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland. At the press conference, Trump caused a bipartisan outcry when he said he saw no reason to believe his own intelligence community’s assertion that Russians had hacked the Democratic National Committee over Putin’s assurances that they had not.</p>\n<p>During the nearly 14-minute monologue, Hannity defended Trump from his critics, while never acknowledging or addressing the comments that had given rise to that criticism. Instead, Hannity told his viewers that Trump’s critics were simply “having a very hard time” dealing with “the speed of Trump,” and keeping up with the pace of the president’s accomplishments. And despite the bipartisan nature of the criticism, Hannity portrayed it as only coming from the media and “the Left.” Toward the end of his monologue, Hannity declared “We’re not afraid to report what the mainstream media will not report.”</p>\n<p>Headlines on Hannity.com can be misleading. For example the headline “ACOSTA GOES GLOBAL: The CNN Reporter HUMILIATES HIMSELF at International Conference,” was attached to a January 2018 story about CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta yelling a question to the president, without any evidence or discussion of why Acosta had “humiliated” himself for doing so.</p>\n<p>A June 2018 story headlined “REPORT: Asylum Requests from Central America UP 892% in 2017” seemed to imply the increase happened in the year 2017. But the story made clear the increase occurred between 2012 and 2017.</p>\n<p>The site does not appear to have a corrections policy. </p>\n<p>Two messages sent through the site’s contact form and an email sent to Hannity’s Fox News account seeking comment about corrections, the monologue mentioned above, and the publication of conspiracy theories were not returned.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Stories on Hannity.com don’t include the name of the writer. There is no information on the site about who works for the site, or who runs it. A contact form allows users to “email Sean or the Hannity show directly.” A message sent to that form seeking comments about the identity of the site’s editorial staff was not returned.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Hannity.com was launched in 1998.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this version this label misstated the country in which the Trump-Putin press conference took place. It was Finland.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJosh Keefe\n\nEdited by:\nEric Effron&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
