Alexander also serves as editor in chief and CEO of PolitiFeed. The site runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Although PolitiFeed does not explicitly state its political leanings, the site tends to run stories from a conservative viewpoint. Content sections include News, Politics, Culture, Media, and Faith. Stories posted on Politifeed.net range from attention-grabbing human-interest stories such as “Baby Crawling Across Busy Street Stops Traffic, Quick Thinking Hero Saves her,” to politically charged articles such as “Left-Wing Activists Harass Ted Cruz and Wife At Restaurant and It’s Caught On Video” and “The Failing New York Times Asked For Help ‘Stopping Fake News’, The Response Was Hilarious.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Politifeed.net sometime attributes information to other sources, but it often neglects to link to those sources, making it harder for readers to judge the veracity of the content -- which often exaggerates or distorts facts.</p>\n<p>For example, an article published in October 2018 was headlined “There Was An Attempt On President Trump’s Life, But The Media Isn’t Covering It.” The article, which attributes some information to CNN, actually reports that “Two items suspected of containing ricin, a poison made from castor beans, were caught while being inspected by the Pentagon. The mail was addressed to [Secretary of Defense James] Mattis as well as U.S. Navy Admiral John Richardson, chief of Naval Operations.” </p>\n<p>Trump is mentioned further down in the article, in this paragraph: “The Secret Service told CNN that they discovered a ‘suspicious envelope addressed to the President’ on October 1st.”  It turned out to be harmless powder. There is no backup to the claim in the headline that there was an attempt on the president’s life that was ignored by the media.</p>\n<p>Another October 2018 article titled “A University Just Banned Clapping Because It ‘Triggers’ Students, Must Use ‘Jazz Hands’ Instead” greatly exaggerates the actual story. The school in question, the University of Manchester, did not ban clapping; a student group, the Manchester Students’ Union, passed an internal motion encouraging the use of silent clapping at its events, according to other press accounts.</p>\n<p>An article from September 2018, “New Report Shows Nearly 40 Million Social Security Numbers Were Stolen By Illegal Immigrants,” claims that “Approximately 40 million Social Security numbers have been stolen and used by illegal immigrants to get work.” The source the story sited -- conservative advocacy law firm Immigration Reform Law Institute -- does not validate this, however. The institute found that between 2012 and 2016, there were “39 million instances where names and Social Security numbers on W-2 tax forms did not match the corresponding Social Security records.” No evidence is provided to back up the claim that all these cases involved immigrants stealing Social Security numbers.</p>\n<p>Another article published in September 2018 is titled “Usain Bolt Stops Interview, Stuns The Crowd With His Response To Our ‘National Anthem’” and features a video in which the Jamaican gold medallist cuts off an interview to be silent for the U.S. National Anthem. The article prefaces the video by stating that “It’s been 2 years since Colin Kaepernick first took a knee on the NFL field and started a controversy that spread faster than a wild fire.” The video is prefaced with a statement that “It’s sad to see so many people not standing up for our country and one man who is not even an American showed us how it should be done.”</p>\n<p>The impression left by this posting is that Bolt was defying Kaepernick and other athletes who have protested during the National Anthem. In fact, the video of Bolt is from 2012 -- before the protests began. The site did not disclose the date of the video.</p>\n<p>Because Politifeed regularly fails to back up claims with credible sources and publishes content with misleading and distorted facts, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not responsibly gather and present information.</p>\n<p>PolitiFeed.net does not describe itself as a conservative site or reveal a political or ideological agenda. Nevertheless, its articles are often infused with a conservative viewpoint, as was the case in the articles mentioned above.</p>\n<p>In another example, a story from August 2018 claimed in the headline that “Networks Ban ‘National Anthem’ From Being Aired, Trump’s Response Sets The Internet On Fire.” In fact, no networks have banned the airing of the National Anthem.</p>\n<p>Because of PolitiFeed’s lack of disclosure of its political orientation and its tendency to misrepresent content to advance an agenda, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not responsibly handle the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<p>PolitiFeed does not appear to run corrections and does not have a stated corrections policy.</p>\n<p>The site’s founder, Matt Alexander, did not respond to two NewsGuard emails seeking comment about PolitiFeed’s editorial standards, its approach to corrections, its misleading headlines, and the conflation of news with opinion.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Politifeed.net names “Matt” as its editor in chief, but does not disclose his full name, Matt Alexander. Nor does the site disclose that he is PolitiFeed’s owner, which NewsGuard determined from website registration information.</p>\n<p>All articles on the site name their author. However, no biographical details are provided for any of the employees at the site and Alexander is the staff member for whom contact information is provided.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<p>Alexander did not respond to two NewsGuard emails seeking comment on the site’s lack of disclosure about its leadership and content creators.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site appears to have been founded in August 2017.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBron Maher\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Eric
