The company also owns several other LGBT-oriented magazines and websites, including Pride, Out magazine, HIV Plus, Out Traveler, and CHILL.</p>\n<p>Pride Media is owned by the investment firm Oreva Capital, which also owns High Times Holding Corp. and its marijuana advocacy magazine High Times.</p>\n<p>The outlet runs advertising and sponsored content and sells print subscriptions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Advocate describes itself as “a prominent voice for topics related to the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community and its allies.” The site is divided into nine categories: Politics, Business, Art and Entertainment, Transgender, Bisexuality, Religion, Family, HIV/AIDS, and Commentary. Content mostly deals with politics and entertainment, with a focus on issues and people affecting the LGBT community.</p>\n<p>On a typical day, the site publishes content such as a review of LGBT films at AFI Fest in Los Angeles, an article about a new antiretroviral medication for adults diagnosed as HIV positive, and a personal essay by a woman who went through conversion therapy -- a controversial practice meant to change someone’s sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>Advocate.com also publishes aggregated articles about incidents of discrimination against LGBT people, with articles running under headlines such as “Holocaust Memorial Defaced With 'Death to LGBT' Graffiti.” A World section covers human rights and the work of LGBT advocacy groups. The site features photo slideshows, with titles such as “111 Shirtless Pics of Palm Springs Pride.” It also produces short social-media videos on news and pop-culture topics.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles generally cite and link to reliable third-party sources, such as the Denver Post, The New York Times, and Buzzfeed News. Articles that cite scientific studies and reports generally link to these studies and accurately reflect their findings. Headlines reflect the content of articles.</p>\n<p>The site is upfront about its advocacy mission and does not misstate or distort facts. Commentary is published in a separate section.  </p>\n<p>Although the site does not state a formal corrections policy, it regularly publishes corrections, which generally appear in italics at the bottom of stories.</p>\n<p>The Gay &#x26; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation has selected The Advocate as the winner in the category of best overall magazine coverage five times at the organization’s annual Media Awards, most recently in 2013. In 2016, the Advocate won Folio magazine's Eddie Digital Award for best consumer news website.</p>\n<p> <strong> </strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>A listing of editorial and management personnel for both the digital and the print publication is accessible through the Staff page, but the site does not provide biographies or contact information for staff and freelance writers. Although articles generally name the writer, no other information is provided, accept for commentary articles, which include short biographies of the author.</p>\n<p>The Staff page also provides the names of senior executives at Pride Media, although it does not clearly state that The Advocate is owned by the company.</p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored content are distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<p>The site did not respond to two NewsGuard emails asking about its limited information on ownership and content creators.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Advocate launched in 1967, two years before the Stonewall riots in New York City helped galvanize the gay rights movement. At first it was a newsletter published by the gay liberation group Personal Rights in Defense and Education (PRIDE).</p>\n<p>After the group disbanded, journalist Richard Mitch turned the newsletter into a newspaper that provided information such as what people should do if they were arrested at a gay bar. In the 1980s, the magazine was in the forefront of AIDS coverage, increasing its news and political section. In the 1990s, it served as a platform for celebrities to disclose their sexual status.</p>\n<p>In 2017, Oreva Capital acquired The Advocate, Out, Pride, Plus, and Out Traveler from their previous owner Here Publishing.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSophia Tewa\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
