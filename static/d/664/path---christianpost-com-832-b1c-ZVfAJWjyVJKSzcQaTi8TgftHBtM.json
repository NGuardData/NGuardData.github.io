The company owns over 100 related websites and earns revenue through advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Post provides Christian news, information, and commentary. News stories cover various churches and ministries, politics, and issues affecting and involving Christians around the world. Those issues include the relationship between video games and the church, abortion, homosexuality, and corrupt church leaders. </p>\n<p>The Post covers Christian entertainment, including new Christian music and movies, and features stories about athletes such as Lebron James. Opinion pieces on the website often criticize current federal policies, with headlines such as “Trump’s Family Separation Policy Was Cruel by Design.”</p>\n<p>Other sections include iPost, a section in which readers often post Bible verses and prayers, and Voices, which features guest columns on “issues affecting society and faith today.” The Post publishes editions in Spanish, Portuguese, and Mandarin. The Post regularly features cartoons based on current events.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Christian Post reporters and contributors write for the website. Headlines are accurate and reflect the information in stories. Some content is based on other accounts from news providers such as The New York Times and CBS, as well as from social media, local TV stations, and socially conservative websites such as LifeSiteNews.</p>\n<p>The Post distinguishes between its news and opinion content, but it has published reader-generated content and satire that could be mistaken as news. The BuzzVine section had published a disclaimer previously that had clarified the content was submitted by readers, according to the fact-checking site Snopes. NewsGuard did not find this disclaimer on the current version of the page. The Post did not reply to NewsGuard’s two emails seeking comment on whether content in BuzzVine is vetted or whether Buzzvine still allows anyone to post content.</p>\n<p>The Post provides a Corrections page which features stories that have been amended. The last time a story was corrected, according to the page, was in 2016.The Post did not reply to NewsGuard’s two emails seeking comment on whether a story has been corrected since 2016.</p>\n<p>The Post also provides a contact email and phone number which readers can use to report inaccuracies found in stories. The Post is a member of the Evangelical Press Association, a nonprofit organization, established in 1949, that maintains a code of ethics.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The Post provides the names of its reporters but no information about them. Readers can find information about the Post’s editorial and senior staff, including a board of “senior editorial advisors.” The Post did not reply to NewsGuard’s two emails seeking comment about why it does not provide information about its reporters.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Christian Post was founded in 2004 and has offices in Washington, New York, and San Francisco.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
