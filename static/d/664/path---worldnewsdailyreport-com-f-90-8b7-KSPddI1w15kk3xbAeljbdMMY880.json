The duo also runs the French-language satirical site Le Journal de Mourréal, which mimics Journal de Montréal, one of Quebec’s leading daily newspapers. </p>\n<p>The site generates revenue from advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Worldnewsdailyreport.com publishes made-up stories that mimic news content, with outrageous, often vulgar headlines. The site runs a disclaimer at the bottom of its homepage identifying its content as “satirical,” although the stories themselves do not carry disclaimers.</p>\n<p>Articles often present shocking fake news involving sex, animals, and crime. Some of the site’s most shared stories in 2018 include “Woman sues Samsung for $1.8M after cell phone gets stuck inside her vagina,” and “Australian police officer brutally beaten and sexually assaulted by kangaroo.”</p>\n<p>The stories are not dated and are often prominently displayed more than a year after they were first published. Images -- without attribution or accurate captions -- are pulled from the internet to supplement the false stories.</p>\n<p>The site’s disclaimer states, “World News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people – are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.”</p>\n<p>In a “FAQ” posted on the site, World News Daily Report answers the question, “Where do you find all this extremely well researched and credible information?”  According to the site: “Our News Team counts members fluent in more than 12 languages. We thus have access to thousands of newspapers around the world and choose information we feel is of interest to the Christian, Muslim and Jewish zionist community worldwide.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>World News Daily Report’s stories have been shared millions of times on social media and other platforms and have been known to mislead people. For example, an October 2018 story, “California: Pro-Choice Activist Proudly Breaks World Record By Getting Her 27th Abortion,” was shared more than 40,000 times on Facebook and other platforms, according to FactCheck.org. In response to the story, one apparently credulous YouTube user commented: “Does abstinence ring any bells?” </p>\n<p>Although the site’s homepage states the content is satire, World News Daily Report’s articles have been shared or republished by sites that do not run such disclaimers. For example, in  2017, the website published an article headlined, “Morgue Employee Cremated While Taking A Nap,” describing an incident said to have occurred in a morgue in Beaumont, Texas.  In late 2017, a site posing as an ABC affiliate station, abcnews-us.com, published the identical story, changing the location to Macomb County, Michigan. After anxious residents called the county coroner and prosecutor’s office, Macomb County had to issue a statement that its morgue does not handle cremations.</p>\n<p>The site uses stock photos and images from unrelated websites to illustrate fictional accounts. For example, the story about a widow who bequeathed an inheritance of over $1 billion to her dog included a picture that also appears on the homepage of a senior citizens’ center in Brenham, Texas. The story about the morgue employee who was cremated used a mug shot of a Mississippi constable charged in 2015 with DUI, identifying him as the fictional morgue employee.</p>\n<p>World News Daily Report was named one of Gizmodo’s “9 worst fake news sites” and was included on PolitiFact’s 2017 “guide to fake news websites.” World News Daily Report had 12 stories on Buzzfeed News’ “top 50 fake stories of 2017” list, more than any other publisher. Two of its fake crime stories topped the list: “Babysitter transported to hospital after inserting a baby in her vagina,” and “FBI seizes over 3,000 penises during raid at morgue employee’s home.” Together, they generated 2.3 million shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook in 2017, Buzzfeed reported.</p>\n<p>Legault, a site co-owner, said in an interview with Radio Canada in 2017 that he does not believe the site deceives anyone who reads it. “We preach to converts,” he said in French. “The majority of people who share it understand that it's a joke, and others share it because they want to believe it, not because they really believe in it.\"</p>\n<p>World News Daily does not run corrections.</p>\n<p>The site did not respond to two inquiries from NewsGuard, sent through the site’s contact form, inquiring about its editorial practices and standards. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>World News Daily Report does not disclose its ownership or editors. Stories are not credited to authors.</p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguished from the site’s news content. Sponsored content is titled “From The Web” with a small disclaimer above trending news articles saying, “Sponsored Links From Taboola.” </p>\n<p>Two emails sent through the site’s contact form asking about its lack of disclosure about its ownership, leadership, and content creators did not receive a response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site launched in November 2013, with the tagline “News You Can Trust.”</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: </em><em>After a further review, this Nutrition Label label includes a more detailed description that takes into account NewsGuard’s nine credibility and transparency criteria.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nIvana Rihter\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
