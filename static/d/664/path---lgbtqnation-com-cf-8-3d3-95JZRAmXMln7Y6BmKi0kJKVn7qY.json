It has published several front-page stories about discrimination against citizens because of their sexual orientation, including lawsuits filed against major retail chains. It also publishes news on gay candidates for office, same-sex marriage and other news organizations’ coverage of gay rights issues.</p>\n<p>Political and legal stories focus on court rulings on same-sex families seeking to adopt children or on workplace discrimination. Several stories in 2018 focused on the makeup of the U.S. Supreme Court and how new appointed justices would impact gay rights. Stories and headlines support positions favoring the expansion of civil rights for the LGBTQ community.</p>\n<p>The site has a clearly marked political commentary section, called The Bilerico Report. The columns have a logo labeling it once users click to it, but the stories are not labeled as opinion in headlines.</p>\n<p>The site also has sections on arts and entertainment, celebrities, health and wellness, and a section called LGBTQ Life, with obituaries, travel pieces and “coming out,” a section on  disclosing sexual orientation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>LGBTQNation.com writers publish original reports on news events affecting gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender issues. Other stories are written by the site’s staff, but based on other news organizations’ reporting, and correctly attribute information to credible news sources and official documents. It also provides material from news services, including The Associated Press, PRNewswire, and state publications focused on gay issues.</p>\n<p>The site’s news headlines often use sensationalized language that can mislead users about the story’s content. One story was titled “Franklin Graham tells Jimmy Carter that Jesus would kill gay people, not marry them,” and shared the evangelist leader’s Facebook post reacting to a quote by Carter, “I believe that Jesus would approve of gay marriage.” </p>\n<p>Graham wrote in his post, “Jesus didn’t come to promote sin, He came to save us from sin. The Bible is very clear. God destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah because of homosexuality.” </p>\n<p>Another headline, “Republicans vote to make it legal nationwide to ban gays &#x26; lesbians from adopting,” inaccurately described a vote by the House Appropriations Committee to allow government-funded adoption agencies to deny same-sex families adoption based on religious objections. The story made clear that the bill had not passed beyond the congressional committee, and one of the 30 Republicans on the committee also voted against it. Two NewsGuard emails asking about the language in its headlines did not receive a response.</p>\n<p>The site posted a corrections policy in October 2018, saying the site will update articles to correct factual errors and “when appropriate, include an editor’s note.” Users can submit corrections requests through a contact form. NewsGuard has not located examples of visible corrections since the policy was implemented.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>LGBTQ Nation’s About section has disclaimers advising users it can not post links to fund-raising campaigns, petitions or business ventures; and can not provide legal advice to people who want to file harassment or discrimination claims. Advertising is clearly distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<p>The section also clearly discloses its ownership by Q!Digital and identifies its top editors and contributing writers. The site has a general contact form and lists its San Francisco mailing address. Articles on LGBTQ Nation are clearly bylined and the bylines link to biographical profiles, email and social media contacts and an archive of other work.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site was founded in 2010.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This label has been updated since LGBTQNation.com posted a correction policy and added a section that discloses its top editors. The site now meets NewsGuard’s standard for “Reveals who’s in charge.”</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJeremy Binckes\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://q.digital\" target=\"_blank\">http://q.digital</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=31249963\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=31249963</a> 8</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/lgbtq-nation-the-nation-s-most-followed-lgbt-news-magazine#\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/lgbtq-nation-the-nation-s-most-followed-lgbt-news-magazine#</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lgbtqnation/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/lgbtqnation/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2018/06/say-hello-man-might-replace-kennedy-say-goodbye-marriage-equality/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2018/06/say-hello-man-might-replace-kennedy-say-goodbye-marriage-equality/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lgbtq-nation/\" target=\"_blank\">https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lgbtq-nation/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2018/06/5-reasons-anthony-kennedys-retirement-major-blow-lgbtq-rights/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2018/06/5-reasons-anthony-kennedys-retirement-major-blow-lgbtq-rights/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2018/07/illinoiss-republican-governor-married-gay-couple-religious-right-really-miffed/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2018/07/illinoiss-republican-governor-married-gay-couple-religious-right-really-miffed/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2687653/cross-sex-hormones-acute-cardiovascular-events-transgender-persons-cohort-study\" target=\"_blank\">http://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2687653/cross-sex-hormones-acute-cardiovascular-events-transgender-persons-cohort-study</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2018/07/franklin-graham-tells-jimmy-carter-jesus-kill-gay-people-not-marry/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2018/07/franklin-graham-tells-jimmy-carter-jesus-kill-gay-people-not-marry/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2018/07/hormone-therapy-linked-dangerous-health-issues-trans-women/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2018/07/hormone-therapy-linked-dangerous-health-issues-trans-women/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2018/07/condoms-used-100-time-prevents-91-hiv-transmission/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2018/07/condoms-used-100-time-prevents-91-hiv-transmission/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=312499580\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=312499580</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FranklinGraham/posts/2008774712512033\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/FranklinGraham/posts/2008774712512033</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2018/07/trump-stealing-money-hiv-programs-pay-migrant-kids-snatched-parents/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2018/07/trump-stealing-money-hiv-programs-pay-migrant-kids-snatched-parents/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/about-lgbtq/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lgbtqnation.com/about-lgbtq/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"lgbtqnation.com","author":"Jeremy Binckes","date":"2018-10-13T11:48:46.799+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/lgbtqnation.com/"}}
