Its other prominent newspaper brands include the Houston Chronicle, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, and Albany Times-Union. Hearst generates revenue from advertising and subscriptions to its printed and digital products.</p>\n<p>SfGate.com is free for users, while sfchronicle.com limits the number of articles a reader can access for free.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The website provides daily coverage focused on local news, as well as business, politics, sports, entertainment, travel, and lifestyle. It also has sections for obituaries and car and home sale listings. In its Local section, the site offers information on Bay Area traffic, weather, earthquakes, wildfires, and crime.</p>\n<p>Sfgate.com does not publish opinion or editorial pieces. Many of its articles are aggregated from other news sites and wire services, such as The Associated Press and Bloomberg.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Sfgate.com pledges to “promptly correct errors of fact and to promptly clarify potentially confusing statements.” Corrections — on articles by Chronicle reporters as well as The AP — are noted on the updated stories themselves, as well as on a separate page of the website. The policy notes, “it will be considered unprofessional conduct and a breach of duty if employees are notified of possible errors but fail to respond.” An email address for readers’ corrections submissions is provided.</p>\n<p>Sfgate.com does not publish opinion pieces, although the San Francisco Chronicle publishes columns and editorials that are available on sfchronicle.com.</p>\n<p>The San Francisco Chronicle has won six Pulitzer Prizes since its founding in 1865. Sfgate.com was named the state’s best website by the California Newspaper Publishers Association in 2010.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Sfgate.com has a Contact Us page providing general contact information for customer service inquiries. It also has a feedback form for readers who want to submit comments or questions. Sfgate.com provides contact information for its editorial and production team. Articles are published with an author’s name, which links to biographical information and a way to contact the staffer. The site discloses its Hearst ownership with a logo at the bottom of its page.</p>\n<p>Sponsored content is clearly distinguished from news content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Sfgate.com was launched in 1993. It is the sister website of sfchronicle.com, the website for the San Francisco Chronicle.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this label erroneously reported that SFgate.com did not provide information about content creators. The rating has been changed to reflect that SFGate.com does provide that information.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nKat Harling\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/aboutsfgate/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfgate.com/aboutsfgate/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/author/brandon-mercer/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfchronicle.com/author/brandon-mercer/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/chronicle-contacts/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfgate.com/chronicle-contacts/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/feedback/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfgate.com/feedback/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2017/05/30142603/state-of-the-news-media-report-2015-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2017/05/30142603/state-of-the-news-media-report-2015-final.pdf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hearst.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.hearst.com/about</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/05/hearst-enjoys-record-revenue-in-2015-no-thanks-to-magazines/\" target=\"_blank\">https://nypost.com/2016/01/05/hearst-enjoys-record-revenue-in-2015-no-thanks-to-magazines/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Corrections-June-15-12995489.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Corrections-June-15-12995489.php</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/corrections/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfgate.com/corrections/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/655969/Media_Kit_and_File_Assets/MEDIA_KIT_GENERAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/655969/Media<em>Kit</em>and<em>File</em>Assets/MEDIA<em>KIT</em>GENERAL.pdf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hearst.com/newspapers/san-francisco-chronicle\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.hearst.com/newspapers/san-francisco-chronicle</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/digital/san-francisco-chronicle-sfgate-com-awarded-best-in-the-state/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.adweek.com/digital/san-francisco-chronicle-sfgate-com-awarded-best-in-the-state/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/staff/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfgate.com/staff/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Supreme-Court-refuses-to-take-up-Martins-Beach-13271592.php?t=ed7559424c\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Supreme-Court-refuses-to-take-up-Martins-Beach-13271592.php?t=ed7559424c </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/business/technology/article/Supreme-Court-won-t-hear-case-over-California-13271554.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfgate.com/business/technology/article/Supreme-Court-won-t-hear-case-over-California-13271554.php </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/hotproperty/article/Hot-Property-Pair-of-turnkey-homes-share-13267109.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/hotproperty/article/Hot-Property-Pair-of-turnkey-homes-share-13267109.php </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Folsom-Street-Fair-stresses-consent-amid-leather-13270424.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Folsom-Street-Fair-stresses-consent-amid-leather-13270424.php </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/science/article/long-valley-caldera-supervolcano-California-13265467.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfgate.com/science/article/long-valley-caldera-supervolcano-California-13265467.php </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/Instagrammable-coffee-shops-San-Francisco-Blue-13261465.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/Instagrammable-coffee-shops-San-Francisco-Blue-13261465.php </a></li>\n<li>Hearst company background <a href=\"http://www.hearst.com/newsroom/history\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.hearst.com/newsroom/history </a>  </li>\n<li>Hearst newspapers overview <a href=\"http://www.hearst.com/newspapers\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.hearst.com/newspapers </a></li>\n<li>Reporter biography <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/author/rachel-swan/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfgate.com/author/rachel-swan/ </a></li>\n<li>Reporter biography <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/author/peter-fimrite/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfgate.com/author/peter-fimrite/ </a></li>\n<li>Reporter biography <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/author/michelle-robertson/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfgate.com/author/michelle-robertson/ </a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"sfgate.com","author":"Kat Harling","date":"2018-10-18T02:10:16.517+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/sfgate.com/"}}
