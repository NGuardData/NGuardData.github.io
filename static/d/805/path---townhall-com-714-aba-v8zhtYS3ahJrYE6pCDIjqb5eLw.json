The company also owns more than a dozen Christian content websites, a publishing arm, Biblical-themed mobile apps, several investment advice sites, and a natural supplement e-commerce site.</p>\n<p>Townhall.com runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Townhall.com does little original reporting. Its writers publish aggregated news stories and analysis written in a blog style under its Tipsheet and Notebook banners. It also publishes a variety of syndicated opinion pieces from notable conservative writers, including Ben Shapiro, Michelle Malkin, Jonah Goldberg, and Ann Coulter. (A note under author names on opinion pieces states “opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com.”) Townhall.com also publishes opinion pieces by members of the U.S. Congress in its Capitol Voices section, as well as wire stories from The Associated Press.</p>\n<p>The site runs movie reviews in its Entertainment section. It maintains a page that tracks political polling results and one that features a slideshow of recent political cartoons. It also streams radio news updates.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Townhall.com publishes news and opinion content from a conservative perspective, and it generally presents accurate information. However, Townhall editor Katie Pavlich claimed in a 2014 story that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) gave itself the “unprecedented” authority to shut down businesses at any time, for any reason, through a cease and desist order.</p>\n<p>In her story, Pavlich quoted and linked to a post on a blog run by the law firm Ballard Spahr about the ruling, which made no such claim. To justify her claim, Pavlich quoted the U.S. Consumer Coalition, a nonprofit group Townhall.com referred to as a “consumer group.” However, liberal news magazine Mother Jones later reported that the group, which regularly attacks the CFPB, is not a grassroots consumer group, but is “run and staffed entirely by a Virginia public relations firm stuffed with ex-GOP operatives” and is funded by anonymous donors. The group also doesn’t list its employees or board members on its site. Pavlich did not quote or cite criticism of the new rule by any other consumer groups, despite writing that “consumer groups” -- plural -- “are pushing back against the rule.” </p>\n<p>In an email, Georgetown law professor Adam Levitin told NewsGuard that Pavlich’s claim was “not true.” Levitin said the law limits “the CFPB’s authority to firms offering consumer financial products or services” and that the CFPB has “no authority to shut down a business generally, only to enjoin particular practices.”  Also, in 2014 Pulitzer Prize winning fact-checking site Politifact asked Ballard Spahr partner and consumer finance attorney Christopher Willis about the claim. Willis explained the rule only allowed the CFPB to issue a cease and desist order for activities that were violating the law, not the business as a whole. Politifact gave Pavlich’s claim a “Pants on Fire” rating. </p>\n<p>Despite this, the story and headline were never corrected. Three emails and a voicemail sent to Townhall Media seeking comment about the story and the site’s corrections policies were not returned. </p>\n<p>Townhall.com has, however, run full corrections in other instances, which included adding “CORRECTION” to the headline. For example, another Pavlich story in 2016 stated that Chelsea Clinton was going to work at a hedge fund. But the story Pavlich cited was from 2006, not 2016. The story was corrected and the headline changed. </p>\n<p>Townhall headlines are conversational, and often display a conservative slant, but usually avoid sensationalism and emotional language in favor of facts. There are exceptions. July 2018 headlines include “Flat Wrong: CNN Torches FBI Agent's Strzok's Claim That His Texts Aren't Indicative Of Bias,” “Pandemonium: GOP Congressman Hits Strzok on Extramarital Affair and Democrats Went Ballistic,” “Outrage Overload: This Is How Liberals Went Berserk Over Trump’s SCOTUS Nominee,” and “Trey Gowdy Destroys FBI's Peter Strzok: Why Did You Talk About Impeaching Trump a Day After the Special Counsel Launched?”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Townhall.com discloses its ownership on an About Townhall page. The site runs bylines with stories that typically link to author biographies and social media accounts. Author emails are not provided. While staff editors often write stories on Townhall.com, the site does not have a page that lists the site’s editors. It also does not provide contact information for anyone at the site, aside from Twitter accounts, though there is a webform through which visitors can submit comments and questions. Three emails to Townhall, a message submitted through their contact form, and a voicemail asking about the site’s limited disclosure about its leadership did not draw a response. Advertisements are clearly differentiated from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Heritage Foundation, a leading conservative think tank, ran Townhall from 1995 until 2005, when the site split from Heritage. Salem acquired Townhall.com a year later.</p>\n<p>In April 2018, Salem-owned Redstate.com laid off much of its editorial staff. Some of the writers who were let go said they believed the site targeted critics of President Donald Trump for firing. In May 2018, Elisha Krauss, a former conservative radio host at a Salem-owned station, accused the company of firing her in January 2017 for not being more supportive of then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election. A senior vice president at Salem told CNN that Krauss was not let go because of her views on Trump, and noted the company’s research “shows that our listeners want our hosts to support the President when he does well, and criticize him if and when he does or says something wrong.” </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJosh Keefe\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Eric
