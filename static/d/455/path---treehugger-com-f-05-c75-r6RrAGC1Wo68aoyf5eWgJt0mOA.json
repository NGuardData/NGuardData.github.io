The company was founded by Joel Babbit, a veteran advertising and public relations executive, and Chuck Leavell, the longtime keyboardist for the Rolling Stones and The Allman Brothers Band, who is also a tree farmer and environmental advocate. The company is overseen by a board of directors that includes four additional corporate executives. Narrative Content Group reports on its website that CNN and Discovery Communications are among its equity partners.</p>\n<p>TreeHugger runs advertisements and sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>TreeHugger publishes news and information about the environment and sustainability, referring to itself on an About page as “a one-stop shop for green news, solutions, and product information” that is “dedicated to driving sustainability mainstream.” Stories on the site are included in sections such as Design, Living, Science, Technology, Transportation, and Energy.</p>\n<p>Writers cover news related to environmental initiatives and ways individuals, businesses, and governments can adopt environmentally sustainable habits and practices. In addition to covering regulatory decisions and scientific studies, for example, the site publishes articles encouraging readers to consider fuel-efficient transportation options, to cook meat-free meals and to buy products from “eco-friendly” brands.</p>\n<p>The site also publishes a regular photo of the day, often sourced from photo-sharing website Flickr, where TreeHugger has a reader group.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>TreeHugger has a managing editor and lists eight writers. The site publishes news and commentary related to its stated mission to promote sustainability and a clean environment. Stories reference sources such as press releases, newspapers, sustainability news and commentary websites, and academic research. Posts typically include links to these sources. The website’s writers sometimes conduct their own reporting, and occasionally publish pieces written in the first person.</p>\n<p>Stories are written from a point of view that reflects the site’s concerns with sustainability and protection of the environment that are conveyed in its mission statement, as well as the site’s name. For example, in September 2018 an article with the headline “Starbucks' greener stores won't make much of a difference; the problem is cultural,” reported on the company’s “green stores” initiative and voiced what the writer saw as the limits of those initiatives. The story quoted from three Starbucks web pages as well as previous TreeHugger articles on the subject.</p>\n<p>When TreeHugger publishes political<strong> </strong>posts, writers often acknowledge the opposing point of view, and cite sources that expand on opposing positions. For example, a July 2018 post headlined “The EPA just made toxic coal ash more dangerous” includes the Environmental Protection Agency acting administrator’s rationale for a decision the agency made to loosen regulations on coal ash disposal. An April 2018 post that criticized the EPA’s decision to revise fuel-efficiency standards among automakers included a statement from the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers that praised the EPA move, as well as a comment from the group’s president.</p>\n<p>The site publishes correction notices to articles that are amended. TreeHugger headlines are occasionally opinionated, but they are fact-based and accurately reflect posts.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>TreeHugger provides the names and biographical information of its editorial staff, including its managing editor and writers, on an About page. Readers can also access information about content creators by clicking on their names. </p>\n<p>The site’s Contact Us page provides email addresses where readers can contact staff. Its About page indicates TreeHugger is part of Narrative Content Group and links to the parent company’s website.</p>\n<p>Sponsored posts on the site are clearly labeled, with disclaimers beneath stories explaining that articles are sponsored and not subject to TreeHugger.com’s editorial control.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>TreeHugger was founded in 2004 by Graham Hill, who also runs LifeEdited, a company focused on sustainable and minimalist living.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSam Howard\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Kendrick
