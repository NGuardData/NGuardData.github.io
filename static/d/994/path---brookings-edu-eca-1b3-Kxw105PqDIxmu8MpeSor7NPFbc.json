Between July 2016 and June 2017, donors who contributed $2 million or more to the nonprofit included the Embassy of the State of Qatar, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and JPMorgan Chase &#x26; Co. Several other foreign governments are listed as contributors, including Norway, Australia, and the United Arab Emirates. Anonymous donations are allowed. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Brookings Institution publishes articles describing its latest research in business, education, national security, the global economy, and various social issues. The site also publishes blog posts written by experts such as Brookings researchers and university professors. Research articles sometimes adopt an advocacy tone, such as “Under US housing policies, homeowners mostly win, while renters mostly lose,” and “Why protecting privacy is a losing game today -- and how to change the game.” Other research articles are straightforward, such as “Views of American democracy based on internet search data.”</p>\n<p>The site’s blogs cover a range of topics including foreign policy, the Trump administration, and technology. Some blog posts are accompanied by videos or podcasts.</p>\n<p>The site has no advertisements other than publicity for books written by Brookings scholars and ads for events hosted by the Institution.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Research articles are written by a mixture of Brookings fellows, academics, and other outside experts. Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has written on national security, for example, while International Monetary Fund economists have written about economic growth. These articles are clearly labeled as “reports” above the headline.  Blog posts and op-eds on the on the site combine the research findings of the Brookings Institution with external statistics to advance an argument. Articles link to sources of information, and base their conclusions on evidence and research.</p>\n<p>Research articles sometimes make partisan arguments, although they are based on original data and can land on both sides of the political spectrum. For example, the site has published stories such as “First, create an Office of Opportunity,” supporting the liberal position advocating  a bigger government effort to reduce income inequality. A piece headlined “More evidence that benefits of government-funded pre-K are overblown” argued against a government program, advancing a conservative position.</p>\n<p>Alhough Brookings is widely considered to be ideologically to the left of center, it has been accused of both a liberal and conservative bias. (The New York Times described it as conservative in 2006 and liberal in 2008.) The Institution’s “Nonpartisanship Policy” articulates the aim of remaining politically impartial.</p>\n<p>Blog posts are often critical of the Trump administration. FixGov, a blog that proposes solutions to various social ills, has published stories such as “Trump’s Lies Corrode Democracy.” A foreign policy blog, Order from Chaos, features stories including  “What Trump gets wrong on allied burden-sharing.” The Avenue, a blog covering cities, published “Trump’s pardons are not policies for the African American community.” The blog posts cite Brookings research and news organizations such as the Washington Post to back up their arguments.  </p>\n<p>Over the years, critics have accused Brookings of allowing donors to affect its findings. In 2014, The New York Times published an article questioning the influence of foreign governments on the Brookings Institution and other think tanks. The piece included an interview with Saleem Ali, a former visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center in Qatar, who said he had been told during his job interview that he could not take positions critical of the Qatari government. </p>\n<p>According to The Times’ account, in 2012, the Qatar Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on the ministry’s website that it was renewing a relationship with Brookings, expressing Qatar’s aspiration that Brookings would “assume its role in reflecting the bright image of Qatar in the international media, especially the American ones.” Brookings sought to help the country gain access to American officials, The Times reported, citing government documents.</p>\n<p>When NewsGuard asked Brookings to comment on allegations that Brookings’ research has been influenced by donations from foreign governments, Brookings spokesperson Adrianna Pita forwarded two press releases Brookings issued following The Times’ story in 2014. The first said Brookings is “not an agent of a foreign government, nor should we register as one, and we reject any characterization of us as such.” The second, from Strobe Talbott, at the time Brookings’ president, stated: “Our scholars determine our research and policy recommendations, not our contributors. We accept funding from foreign governments with the understanding that they are supporting our independent research.”</p>\n<p>In 2014, the Washington Post reported that Brookings began promoting the legalization of marijuana after receiving donations from Peter B. Lewis, a billionaire who championed the cause. According to the Post, Brookings’ aggressive fundraising in recent years enhanced the influence of donors on the institution. The Post story also pointed to other areas in which Brookings has apparently been influenced by its funders, including education, skilled worker visa programs, transportation, and energy policy. </p>\n<p>In 2015, Robert Litan, a Brookings economist, was forced to resign after U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts accused him of failing to fully disclose corporate involvement in a Brookings study he conducted.</p>\n<p>Asked by NewsGuard for comment on claims that Brookings’ research is influenced by wealthy donors, Pita pointed to the institution’s research independence policy, which says that Brookings will not accept money from donors “who seek to undermine the independence of its scholars’ research or otherwise to predetermine or influence recommendations.” The policy also states that Brookings scholars must not allow any third party, including donors, “to adversely affect their methods or conclusions.”  </p>\n<p>Despite the criticisms, Brookings has long been considered one of the most influential think tanks in the U.S. and the world. The University of Pennsylvania’s “Global Go To Think Tank Index Report” has named Brookings the top think tank in the world every year since 2009. In 2017, it was ranked second behind the conservative Heritage Foundation on the report’s list of think tanks with the “most significant impact on public policy,” having topped those rankings in 2016, when President Barack Obama was in office.</p>\n<p>Brookings’ research has led to new federal legislation and regulations. In 2007, it began a collaboration with Dartmouth College to research accountable care organizations (ACOs), which link payments for groups of doctors and other health care providers to the quality and cost of care for a defined patient population. That research led to the inclusion of an ACO model for Medicare in the Affordable Care Act. As of 2018, about 12 million Medicare beneficiaries were covered by an ACO, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, although the results in terms of cost savings and improved care have been mixed.  </p>\n<p>Brookings’ influence has ebbed and flowed in recent decades, depending on which party has controlled White House and Congress. According to the 2014 edition of “Who’s Running America?” by Professor Thomas Dye of Florida State University, Brookings’ influence waned during the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, then recovered during Bill Clinton’s presidency, when longtime Brookings fellow Alice Rivlin served as director of the Office of Management and Budget. The institution’s staff “were influential participants in developing Hillary Clinton’s comprehensive health care package,” according to Dye’s book.  </p>\n<p>Brookings.edu does not regularly publish corrections on its site and does not provide a corrections policy. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles include authors’ names, titles, and often Twitter handles. An Experts page lists over 300 of Brookings.edu’s contributors, who, according to the site, are “leading experts in government and academia.” A leadership page lists the Brookings Institution’s executive staff.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>In 1916, Robert S. Brookings and other researchers concerned about public policy issues founded the Institute for Government Research. After Brookings founded the Institute of Economics in 1922 and a graduate school in 1924, the three institutions merged to become the Brookings Institution in 1927.</p>\n<p>According to a 2016 Nieman Lab article, Brookings has been increasing its online news presence in recent years, publishing as many as 20 new stories a day at the time of the Nieman story. Tracy Viselli, a Brookings’ senior advisor for strategic communications, told Nieman Lab that her goal was to publish a blog post for every Brookings study or article published.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJohn Gregory\n\nEdited by:\nJoyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
