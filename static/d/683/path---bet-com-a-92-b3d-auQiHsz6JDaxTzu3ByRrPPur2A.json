The site also covers personal and professional milestones for black musicians, athletes and entertainers, often with red-carpet video interviews and photos. Stories are written in a casual, conversational style around video clips, tweets and occasionally GIFs.</p>\n<p>Its national news section, which has a tab on the site and is featured in a “Latest” bar on the homepage, runs text stories that focus on instances of racial discrimination, or crimes committed against black people.  Stories on a July 2018 home page include “White</p>\n<p>Cop Restrains Black Child For Crying Over Dad’s Arrest,” “White Man Arrested For the Killing of 18-year-old Nia Wilson,” And “Teacher Allegedly Pulls Out 7-year-old Black Student’s Braid.” Most of the stories are credited to other news sources.</p>\n<p>BET also produces several videos, with embedded text, covering the White House and international news, such as President Donald Trump’s July 2018 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. Stories about former president Barack Obama and his family are also prominent.</p>\n<p>The site runs  web-only documentary series as well,  available only on BET.com and BET mobile apps. Users can watch BET content live.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>News articles and videos  on the site are generally fact-based and clearly sourced to other news outlets, with links.</p>\n<p>Some stories and headlines, however, editorialize. In one article about Trump’s unsuccessful attempt on one occasion to hold his wife’s hand, BET called the gesture a “public display of abhorrence,” before rounding up mocking tweets from Twitter users. A headline “Flying While Black: Tamar Braxton ‘Ridiculed’ by Delta pilot,” is based on a tweeted claim by the entertainer that the pilot addressed her and her sister harshly because of their race.</p>\n<p>The BET network has faced criticism from its co-founder, Sheila Johnson,  for pushing negative stereotypes about black Americans and avoiding coverage of serious topics. Those critics have pointed to the network’s emphasis on rap and hip-hop music videos and reality television. In 2012, Johnson said she was “ashamed” of the network, which “squandered a really important cable network, when it really could have been the voice of black America.” She added that while she had hopes that the network would tackle important issues in the black community, it had “lower[ed] the bar just so they could get eyeballs on the screen.”</p>\n<p>In 2007 the National Association of Black Journalists, an advocacy group, gave BET its \"Thumbs Down Award\" award at its annual convention, as critics decried the channel’s coverage of low-brow entertainment. The network responded by pointing to monthly documentaries about Darfur and AIDS in the black community. Some of those documentaries were nominated for awards from NABJ.  </p>\n<p>The site does not have a publicly available corrections policy. BET did not reply to a query by NewsGuard through the BET website.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>BET discloses its ownership by Viacom Inc. News articles on BET.com are bylined, with attribution given to videos and photos. Its ownership is disclosed at the bottom of the site. Advertisements are separate from news and feature content, and sponsored content is labeled with a banner.</p>\n<p>The site does not list its editorial leaders. BET did not reply to two NewsGuard queries on the site’s contact us submission form, inquiring about its failure to disclose the names of its top editors.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Sheila Crump Johnson and Robert L. Johnson founded Black Entertainment Television in 1979 with a $15,000 bank loan and $500,000 in funding. The Washington-based network started airing music videos and scripted television aimed at a black audience, then launched a half-hour newscast and more politically oriented shows featuring journalist Ed Gordon and Tavis Smiley. Since the turn of the century, those broadcasts have been slowly phased out. “Teen Summit,” which premiered in 1989, was eliminated in 2002.</p>\n<p>BET.com was registered in 1995.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJeremy Binckes\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Joyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/bet-is-leaving-washington-will-it-lose-its-secret-sauce/2017/05/10/0d634f74-358a-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d2a229b788f2\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/bet-is-leaving-washington-will-it-lose-its-secret-sauce/2017/05/10/0d634f74-358a-11e7-b373-418f6849a004<em>story.html?noredirect=on&#x26;utm</em>term=.d2a229b788f2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090825005245/en/Vibe-Lifestyle-Network-Announces-Jermaine-Hall-New\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090825005245/en/Vibe-Lifestyle-Network-Announces-Jermaine-Hall-New</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2015/05/27/bets-unsung-cofounder-sheila-johnson-is-making-her-mark-on-the-film-industry/#1040af6b7a82\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2015/05/27/bets-unsung-cofounder-sheila-johnson-is-making-her-mark-on-the-film-industry/#1040af6b7a82</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7370565/20yl-new-web-series-debuts-bet-com?utm_source=GooglePlus\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7370565/20yl-new-web-series-debuts-bet-com?utm_source=GooglePlus</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bet.com/news/national/2018/03/09/barack-and-michelle-in-talks-with-netflix-for-producing-deal.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bet.com/news/national/2018/03/09/barack-and-michelle-in-talks-with-netflix-for-producing-deal.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bet.com/news/national/2018/04/24/trump-tries-to-hold-melania-s-hand-again.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bet.com/news/national/2018/04/24/trump-tries-to-hold-melania-s-hand-again.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12668674\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12668674</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.montereyherald.com/20121012/bet-co-founder-sheila-johnson-takes-swipe-at-network-at-carmel-art-film-festival\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.montereyherald.com/20121012/bet-co-founder-sheila-johnson-takes-swipe-at-network-at-carmel-art-film-festival</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/sheila-johnson-slams-bet\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thedailybeast.com/sheila-johnson-slams-bet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bet.com/video/news/national/2018/trump-met-with-bipartisan-disapproval-after-putin-meeting.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bet.com/video/news/national/2018/trump-met-with-bipartisan-disapproval-after-putin-meeting.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bet.com/news/national/2018/07/18/man-forces-stripper-to-zip-tie-herself-and-shoots-her-with-stun-.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bet.com/news/national/2018/07/18/man-forces-stripper-to-zip-tie-herself-and-shoots-her-with-stun-.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/bet.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.whois.com/whois/bet.com</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"bet.com","author":"Jeremy Binckes","date":"2018-07-31T14:31:01.496+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/bet.com/"}}
