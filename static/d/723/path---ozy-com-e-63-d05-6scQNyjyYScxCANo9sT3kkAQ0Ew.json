In 2017, Ozy raised an additional $10 million in a third-round round of funding, led by the venture capital firm GSV Capital. The site’s co-founder is Carlos Watson, formerly a political commentator on CNN and news anchor on MSNBC.</p>\n<p>The website earns revenue through advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Ozy publishes visually rich content on topics of interest to millennial readers, such as multiculturalism, gender politics, and race. Sections include States of the Nation, which provides in-depth reporting from all 50 states; and Rising Stars, which feature profiles of what the site describes as “people who are accelerating our culture and advancing the conversation – for good or for ill.”  Around the World features reporting from more than 100 countries and, according to the site, aims to provide stories from “every single country on the map” by the end of 2018.</p>\n<p>Ozy also publishes The Presidential Daily Brief, which summarizes the daily news, as well as opinion stories and first-person essays. </p>\n<p>Ozy has produced TV shows on PBS and the BBC, which visitors can watch in full on the site. Ozy’s podcast, The Thread, explores how important historical figures and events are related to the present. In June 2018, Ozy announced a partnership with iHeartMedia that will feature Ozy’s content in iHeartMedia’s morning shows across the United States. The company also produces Ozy Fest, an annual event that The New York Times describes as \"part music festival, part TED talk, part food fair.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Ozy reporters, editors, and contributors create content for the website. Stories frequently feature original, on-site reporting and first-hand interviews. Headlines are measured, and reflect the content of stories. </p>\n<p>Co-founder Watson has described Ozy as a “progressive media company.” Still, its story selection provides multiple perspectives on political issues. Ozy most often presents liberal viewpoints in its opinion section, but news and opinion are clearly differentiated on the website. </p>\n<p>Ozy attributes photos, quotes, and reporting conducted by others. Hyperlinked keywords in stories generally link to unrelated content on ozy.com. Within a quote in its story about exercise in Africa, for example Ozy hyperlinks the word “run.” The link directs readers to an unrelated story titled, “Bosnia Races Against Its Growing Obesity Epidemic.”</p>\n<p>Ozy does not provide a visible corrections policy, but it does regularly correct factual errors in its reporting. Readers can find amended articles on the website by searching for the word “correction.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Ozy.com provides the names and biographies of its writers, editors, senior staff, and investors. Readers can email writers and contact some other staff through social media. The Contact page provides an email address for general inquiries. </p>\n<p>Ads are distinguished from news content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>OZY was launched in September 2013 by Watson, who is currently CEO of the company. His co-founder is Samir Rao, who works on operations and strategy. The company has offices in Mountain View, California.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/carlos-watson-ozy-media-2013-9\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.businessinsider.com/carlos-watson-ozy-media-2013-9</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=250285360\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=250285360</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/0929039D:US-ozy-media-inc\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/0929039D:US-ozy-media-inc</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/10/06/axel-springer-investment-in-ozy/16764657/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/10/06/axel-springer-investment-in-ozy/16764657/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pehub.com/2017/01/gsv-capital-leads-10-mln-for-online-magazine-ozy-media/#\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pehub.com/2017/01/gsv-capital-leads-10-mln-for-online-magazine-ozy-media/#</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/ozy-media-raises-10-million-1201968662/\" target=\"_blank\">https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/ozy-media-raises-10-million-1201968662/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ozy-media-raises-10-million-to-expand-video-events-1485234000\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/ozy-media-raises-10-million-to-expand-video-events-1485234000</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/carlos-watson-joins-msnbc-as-dayside-anchor/30047\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/carlos-watson-joins-msnbc-as-dayside-anchor/30047</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/opinion/should-there-be-gender-and-racial-quotas-for-the-us-congress/88030\">https://www.ozy.com/opinion/should-there-be-gender-and-racial-quotas-for-the-us-congress/88030</a></h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/opinion/should-there-be-gender-and-racial-quotas-for-the-us-congress/88030\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ozy.com/opinion/should-there-be-gender-and-racial-quotas-for-the-us-congress/88030</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3> </h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2018-06-07/iheartmedia-and-ozy-media-announce-a-multiyear-multiplatform-creative-partnership\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2018-06-07/iheartmedia-and-ozy-media-announce-a-multiyear-multiplatform-creative-partnership</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/rising-stars\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ozy.com/rising-stars</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/flashback/introducing-ozys-new-podcast-the-thread-with-ozy/80849#slide5\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ozy.com/flashback/introducing-ozys-new-podcast-the-thread-with-ozy/80849#slide5</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/politics-and-power/the-national-debts-looming-impact-on-your-paycheck/79059\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ozy.com/politics-and-power/the-national-debts-looming-impact-on-your-paycheck/79059</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/acumen/ozy-video-soda-pop-showdown-in-mexico/40337\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ozy.com/acumen/ozy-video-soda-pop-showdown-in-mexico/40337</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/politics-and-power/how-conservatives-really-see-gun-control/88239\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ozy.com/politics-and-power/how-conservatives-really-see-gun-control/88239</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/this-national-sports-icon-gives-a-different-kind-of-kick/87951\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/this-national-sports-icon-gives-a-different-kind-of-kick/87951</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/ozy-tribe/our-team\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ozy.com/ozy-tribe/our-team</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianmitchell/2018/04/05/ozy-founder-carlos-watson-is-leading-a-media-movement-for-the-change-generation/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianmitchell/2018/04/05/ozy-founder-carlos-watson-is-leading-a-media-movement-for-the-change-generation/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"ozy.com","author":"Evan Haddad","date":"2018-11-12T20:12:05.460+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ozy.com/"}}
