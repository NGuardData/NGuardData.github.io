The company has run a deficit nearly every quarter since its founding, and has relied on cash advances from board member William Hambrecht, a banker, and former board member John Warnock, co-founder and former CEO of Adobe, Inc. Their cash advances to Salon totalled nearly $20 million as of 2015, according to a 2016 Politico article.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Salon publishes articles about politics, business, culture, science, health, and food. The site runs first-person essays in a Life Stories section. SalonTV, a dedicated video section, contains programs such as Salon Talks, featuring interviews with celebrities and other notables, and Salon Now, covering news developments.</p>\n<p>Many stories cite reporting by news organizations such as HuffPost and The Washington Post, and tweets from political figures and journalists. Some stories are posted in their entirety directly from other news outlets, such as ProPublica, a journalism nonprofit, and FAIR.org, a liberal-oriented media criticism organization.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Salon’s stories are typically grounded in fact and cite credible sources, including firsthand accounts, especially in its exclusive Salon Talks interviews. Headlines accurately reflect the content. </p>\n<p>Although Salon does not describe itself as having a liberal perspective, its coverage is largely critical of President Trump and other conservative figures. This perspective is evident in both the tone of articles and its selection of stories, such as “MSNBC's Joe Scarborough rips former party: ‘The hypocrisy of the Republicans is beyond breathtaking’” and “Has Trump wrecked our sex life? ‘Post-Trump Sex Disorder’ is real, says sex therapist.”</p>\n<p>When NewsGuard asked Jordan Hoffner, Director and CEO of Salon Media Group, to characterize Salon’s politics, he said in a phone interview: “I can tell you what Salon is, and what it is not. We are pro-First Amendment, pro-truth, pro-reading, pro-intellectualism, pro-free markets and capitalism, pro-environment, meaning climate change is real, pro-animal rights, pro-agriculture, pro-LGBTQ, pro-democracy, pro-affordable health care, pro-responsible journalism, and pro fact-checking. Then what we are not: We are anti-corruption, anti-foreign infiltration of government and society, anti-separating children at the border, anti-fascism, and anti-authoritarianism.”</p>\n<p>Although none of Salon’s articles is clearly labeled as “opinion” or “commentary,” many stories express strong opinions, such as two July 2018 articles headlined “Donald Trump’s startling global agenda: Taking white supremacy worldwide,” and “A new axis of evil? Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin share an open contempt for human rights.” Asked why Salon did not label opinion as such, Hoffner told NewsGuard: “I think it’s pretty easy to determine what’s news versus an opinion piece. People are free to express their opinions, and those opinions come from a variety of viewpoints.”</p>\n<p>Other articles insert political critiques into news coverage, sometimes adding comments unrelated to the story. </p>\n<p>For example, a July 2018 story about the use of a racial slur by John Schnatter, Papa John’s founder, began with straight coverage, citing reports by Forbes and Bloomberg. It then added that months earlier, the pizza chain had stopped advertising with the NFL in response to the football league’s handling of players kneeling during the national anthem. In a digression that was not directly related to Schnatter’s resignation, the article criticized Trump for starting “a culture war about NFL players who choose to protest racial injustice by kneeling.” </p>\n<p>Another July 2018 news story, headlined “Remote-access allowed: Voting machine company admits installing vulnerable software,” summarized reporting by Vice Media’s Motherboard, but ended with criticism of President Trump for paying too little attention to the issue, despite his frequent complaints about being victimized by voter fraud in 2016. “It would seem that if his grievances were genuine — as opposed to being excuses for him losing the popular vote in the 2016 presidential election or trying to justify repressive legislation like Voter ID laws — he would be focused on such a scandal,” the article concluded.</p>\n<p>Asked about the site’s inclusion of commentary in news stories, Hoffner told NewsGuard in a phone call: “It's something we're very cognizant of and don’t want to happen. We'll keep working on it. It's a work in progress.”</p>\n<p>Because the site does not disclose the liberal perspective that is evident in its coverage, and because news stories sometimes contain unlabeled commentary, NewsGuard has determined that Salon does not meet the  standards for handling the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>The Corrections page of the site posts a list of corrections it has posted since 2009, and explains that it is Salon’s policy to note significant errors, although not minor spelling mistakes.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Most articles name their author, often linking to a page that provides the writer’s biography and contact information.</p>\n<p>The Staff page lists Salon’s management, editorial, and business staff, but provides no biographical or contact information other than the Twitter handle for Salon’s CEO. Because of the site’s lack of biographical or contact information for its editorial leadership, Salon does not meet NewsGuard’s standard for revealing who is in charge. </p>\n<p>The About Salon page describes its owner, Salon Media Group. The site provides financial information on an Earnings page and a Press Releases and News page. A Corporate Governance page lists Salon’s board of directors and provides a photo and bio for each board member. </p>\n<p>Hoffner told NewsGuard in February 2019 that the site would soon add contact information to its masthead.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are distinguished from news content. Sponsored stories are typically labeled “sponsored content” and surrounded by a gray box that separates them from news stories. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Salon was launched in 1995 by David Talbot, a former editor at the San Francisco Examiner. It was one of the first entirely digital news outlets, initially focusing on cultural coverage and expanding its political coverage in the late 1990s. Its early influential stories include an<em> </em>expose of an extramarital affair involving then-U.S. Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, that was published shortly before the 1998 impeachment proceedings of then-President Bill Clinton, and a report about how Clinton’s White House had incentivized news outlets to publish anti-drug messaging<em>. </em>Salon went public in 1999 with a valuation of $107 million. The website has since been plagued by financial challenges, layoffs, and executive turnover. </p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label incorrectly credited reporting about voting machines to The New York Times. That information came from Vice Media’s Motherboard.</em></p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: Upon further review, NewsGuard has determined that Salon does not adequately provide information about site leaders. Also, this Nutrition Label has been updated to include new comments from </em><em>Jordan Hoffne</em><em>r, </em><em>Director </em><em>and CEO of Salon Media Group</em><em>.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.salon.com/about\"
