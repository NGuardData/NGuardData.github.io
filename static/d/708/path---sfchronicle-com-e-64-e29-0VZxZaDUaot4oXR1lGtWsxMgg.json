Its other prominent newspaper brands include the Houston Chronicle, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, and Albany Times-Union. Hearst generates revenue from advertising and subscriptions to its printed and digital products. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content </h3>\n<p>Sfchronicle.com publishes daily articles on local, national, and global news related to business, politics, technology, sports, lifestyle, and entertainment. Pieces focus on breaking world news, as well as local news specific to the San Francisco Bay Area, such as “BART extension to Antioch so popular there’s no room at the station to park.” </p>\n<p>The website has an opinion page featuring pieces written by its editorial staff or by readers who have submitted opinion pieces. The editorial staff also publishes recommendations and endorsements about local and national politics.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site’s news reporting is straightforward, as are its headlines. Editorial pieces, including political endorsements, are well distinguished from its general news content. In a March 2018 article titled “How and why the San Francisco Chronicle makes endorsements,” John Diaz, the editorial page editor, detailed the process behind making endorsements, explaining that the publication “maintains a firewall between its news and opinion operations,” and that any endorsement “represents the consensus opinion of the editorial board.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Sfchronicle.com’s Contact Us page provides the contact and biographical information for its managerial, editing, and reporting staff. Author names published with articles link to writers’ biographies. Articles list the date of any updates or corrections. Sponsored content is clearly marked.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The San Francisco Chronicle, originally The Daily Dramatic Chronicle, was founded in 1865 by members of the de Young family. In 2000, the Hearst family bought the publication. Hearst previously ran The Examiner, another local daily paper, and sold The Examiner when it acquired the San Francisco Chronicle. Sfgate.com, the publication’s free website, was launched in 1994. Sfchronicle.com, the paid subscription website offering premium access to in depth features, photos, and columns, was launched in 2013.  </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nKat Harling\n\nEdited
