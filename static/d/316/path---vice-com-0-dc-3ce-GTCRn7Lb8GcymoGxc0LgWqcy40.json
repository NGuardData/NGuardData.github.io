Vice Media has raised $1.4 billion from The Walt Disney Company, A&#x26;E Networks, 21st Century Fox, and others. Vice Media also owns Virtue Worldwide, an advertising agency that formerly served as Vice’s creative arm.</p>\n<p>The site runs advertising and brand-sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Vice reporters produce original content globally in text, videos, and photos. It conducts in-depth interviews and reports on such subjects ranging from politics and terrorism to sex and drugs. Typical articles include “Ten Questions You Always Wanted to Ask Someone Committed to a Psych Ward,” “We Spent a Month Swiping Right on Minder, the Muslim Tinder,” and “Former Neo-Nazis Tell Us How They Finally Left the Movement.” </p>\n<p>Vice is known for sending journalists into dangerous circumstances, including the Syrian region occupied by the Islamic State, North Korea, and Eastern Ukraine. Some articles feature unconventional reporting methods. A March 2015 photo essay “Twenty Hours in a New York Strip Club” documented a Vice reporter’s verbal and physical interactions with strippers and other guests. As part of an March 2014 story “Getting High on HIV Medication,” a Vice reporter tested the drug himself. Vice.com also publishes provocative essays by contributors, such as “I Sold My Used Underwear for Heroin,” and graphic photographs and explicit articles under its “NSFW” (not safe for work) tag.</p>\n<p>The site has “Channels,” or subject-specific pages, covering topics ranging from sports and video games to fashion and music. The Broadly channel focuses on what the site describes as “the lives and experiences of women, gender non-conforming people, and LGBT individuals.” The Munchies section says it “occupies the intersection where humans and food connect.” The Tonic section, according to the site, “covers wellness, science and big-picture health issues” and includes among its subsections: Mind, Healthcare, Body, Race, Sex, Weed, and Psychedelics.</p>\n<p>“Viceland,” the company’s television channel, runs documentary-style shows geared towards millennials. The “Vice News” channel publishes articles accompanying episodes of “Vice,” a separate TV series that Vice Media produces with HBO, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, and talk show host Bill Maher. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Vice.com features original reporting conducted by staff journalists. Stories link to external sources. Photographs, illustrations, and video content are clearly attributed.</p>\n<p>A June 2018 article about Vice Media in New York Magazine described an instance in 2015 when an associate producer for the HBO show, Vice, was fired after telling a woman in Texas that Vice would “pay for her abortion if she was willing to be filmed.” The plan was never carried out. </p>\n<p>In another instance, according to a 2015 article by the Columbia Journalism Review, a female editorial employee at Vice claimed that she was “asked to go undercover as a prostitute” for a story about sex workers in a developing country. She said she declined to pursue the story.  </p>\n<p>In October 2014, a former Vice employee, Charles Davis, tweeted a screenshot of a message from a Vice editor reminding him that “any ‘brand’ mention -- basically any mention of a large entity that we might be making some kind of business deal with -- should get run up the flagpole” to the general manager. In a Politico.com article, a Vice spokesman denied that the company has a policy requiring editors to get so-called “brand” stories approved by the business side. He acknowledged, though, that corporate wants to know about stories involving brand partners, so they can give them advance warning a story is coming.</p>\n<p>A 2016 Washington Post article, headlined “Vice Media goes gonzo on the news. Advertisers may be a different story,” addressed Davis’s experience and several other incidents suggesting that Vice sometimes blurs the line between editorial and sponsored content. In one incident, Vice interviewed New York Times reporter David Sanger about military contractors without revealing that the footage would be used for an advertisement for “Call of Duty,” a video game. Vice apologized when confronted by Sanger; the promotional video is now unavailable on the Vice website, but is still accessible on Youtube. In another case, an anonymous former Vice employee described how Vice killed an investigation into Bank of America’s mortgage-lending practices before announcing “The Business of Life,” a Vice show sponsored by Bank of America.</p>\n<p>In response to the Washington Post article, a Vice spokesperson said that the Washington Post’s reporting was “old or inaccurate [with] absolutely no bearing on how we operate today.”</p>\n<p>Despite these scattered mishaps, NewsGuard concluded that Vice generally gathers and presents news responsibly because its international reporting team produces a steady flow of thoroughly reported, ambitious journalism. Its five-part documentary “The Islamic State” has been particularly well-received.</p>\n<p>The late New York Times media writer David Carr wrote in 2014 that conflict zones traditionally covered only by mainstream media outlets are now being increasingly challenged by “new players” like Vice, praising the company for “approaching the same work from a different angle than the usual suspects and finding a significant audience for what it does.”</p>\n<p>Vice did not comment in the New York Magazine article on the abortion claim nor did it comment in the Columbia Journalism Review story describing the “undercover prostitute” assignment.  Two emails from NewsGuard seeking comment about the claims went unanswered. </p>\n<p>Vice.com regularly publishes corrections, which appear in italics above the article. In 2014, Vice won an Emmy Award for “Outstanding Informational Series Or Special” for its HBO show. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Contact and biographical information for Vice staff members vary depending on the section that their articles are published. Articles provide the name of the writer, and occasionally link to contact information, social media accounts, and short biographies. The site’s About page features an extensive masthead of the US editorial team. The about page also includes general email addresses for various departments, as well as links for idea submissions, technical issues, subscriptions, and advertising information. The page also lists by name the two Vice founders, who remain involved in the company, Shane Smith and Suroosh Alvi.</p>\n<p>The site provides a guide on its many varieties of branded content, describing the meaning of each label. “Supported by,” the site says, refers to content paid for by the advertiser and produced solely by Vice’s editorial department. “Created with,” according to the site, means the content was produced by the advertiser, in conjunction with Vice’s editorial department. “Partner Content,” the site says, is paid for by an advertiser who provides “creative direction and feedback.” Finally, “From our Advertiser / Advertisement” is content that is created and controlled by the advertiser, the site says.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>In 1994, Shane Smith, Suroosh Alvi, and Gavin McInnes founded a Canadian punk magazine that would later be renamed Vice.The company moved to New York in 1999, and later expanded to the U.K. and other countries. By 2007, Vice Media was producing and investing heavily in digital video content. Vice has partnered with media brands including HBO, A&#x26;E Networks, and Snap Inc. to produce digital content across their platforms.</p>\n<p>In December 2017, The New York Times reported that the company had settled several sexual harassment complaints by female employees, amid a pattern of sexual misconduct described by more than two dozen women. Smith and Alvi published a letter in response, apologizing for Vice’s “boys club” culture and outlining the company’s plans for preventing new instances of “unacceptable behaviour.”
