{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<div class=\"right-score\">Score: 72.5</div>\n<h1>fark.com&emsp; <span class=\"net-country\">(WEB - en-US)</span></h1>\n<p>A satirical website that aggregates user-submitted links to news stories from other sites and adds humorous or absurdist descriptions of the content.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>Fark.com is owned and run by Drew Curtis, author of the book, “It's Not News, It's FARK: How Mass Media Tries to Pass off Crap as News.” He ran as an independent for Kentucky governor in 2015, with his wife Heather as his running mate. Fark.com earns revenue from advertising and subscription packages, including BareFark, which offers users an ad-free experience on the site, and TotalFark, which provides a “behind-the-scenes view” of the site.</p>\n<p>Fark posts two slogans, which appear interchangeably at the top of the site’s sections: “Real News. Real Funny.” and “It’s Not News. It’s Fark.” On the About page, Fark states that site “is supposed to look like news... but it's not news. It's Fark.”</p>\n<p>Fark does not publish stories directly on its own site and instead aggregates links to content produced elsewhere, including social media, local newspapers, digital magazines, blogs, and large media organizations such as the BBC and Fox News. Fark’s users submit links to the content. According to the site, Fark receives approximately 2,000 submissions a day, from which it says it “hand-pick[s] the funny and weird notable news  — and not news  — of the day.” Registered users can comment on the curated links.</p>\n<p>Fark provides a mix of odd, often bizarre news, as well as some politics and current events. On a typical day, Fark may link to a local news story about an ecstasy pill found in a fast-food burger and to a New York Times report of rumored turmoil within the Trump administration. Fark’s original descriptions are often short and facetious.</p>\n<p>For example, for an NBC News story about an Indiana toddler who shot his sister, Fark’s description read, “The only thing that can protect you from a bad toddler with a gun is a good toddler with a gun.” A story about an enormous Canadian cow proclaimed, “The steaks have just got bigger as US farmer claims he owns world’s biggest cow.” A link to a Washington Post story about the economy quipped, “Good news, everyone: wages aren’t stagnant, they’re merely sluggish.”</p>\n<p>Fark’s curation and descriptions of political content often take aim at U.S. President Donald Trump and Republicans. In general, however, political stories appear to represent a minority of the content. In addition to Politics, the site’s sections include Discussion, Sports, Business, Geek, Entertainment, D’awww, and Food.</p>\n<p>Most story descriptions reflect some aspect of the content, but often add information not included in or related to the original story. For example, Fark described a story about dead dolphins in Florida with the lead-in: “Alarming spike in dolphin deaths happening across southwest Florida as dolphins realize they reached Florida.” </p>\n<p>For an article on the funeral of President George H.W. Bush, Fark wrote, “White House announces President Trump will attend former President George Bush's funeral, forgets to add ‘unless it rains of course.’” </p>\n<p>According to the site, “Fark isn’t an acronym. It doesn’t mean anything. The idea was to have the word Fark come to symbolize news that is really Not News.” Curtis bought the domain name in 1997 but did not launch Fark until February 1999 when, the site says, Curtis “had an epiphany  — or a really good buzz.”</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nJim Warren&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership
