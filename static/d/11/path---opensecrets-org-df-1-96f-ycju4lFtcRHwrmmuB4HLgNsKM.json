It is funded primarily by donors, whose names are disclosed on OpenSecrets.org. Donors who contributed over $100,000 to the center since 2017 are the Democracy Fund, The Ford Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Democratic mega-donor George Soros’ Open Society Foundation, and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, according to the site.</p>\n<p>OpenSecrets.org has a Donate page where readers can contribute to the center. In addition to donations, the center says it generates “income earned from custom research and licensing data for commercial use.” The site also runs limited advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>OpenSecrets.org publishes original investigations and news articles related to campaign finance, lobbying, and “dark money” (political spending by groups that do not have to disclose their donors.) These stories appear on the site’s homepage and in its News &#x26; Analysis section. Typical articles on the site have included “Cost of 2018 election surpasses $3.9 billion, a midterm record” and “Indicted House candidates Collins, Hunter experience steep drop-off in contributions.”</p>\n<p>The site maintains a trove of data on campaign contributions and campaign spending by outside groups, which it pulls from government sources, mainly the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Tools provided by OpenSecrets.org allow users to search the FEC data by election year to see which industries, corporations, individuals, and unions have supported which candidates for federal office. Open Secrets can even link industry-related contributions to the industry-related committees the members of Congress sit on.</p>\n<p>The site provides  lists of the largest individual campaign donors, as well as the candidates and committees to which they have donated. It also allows visitors to look up independent groups, such as nonprofits and super PACs (Political Action Committees), to see how they have spent money to influence elections. </p>\n<p>OpenSecrets.org also publishes the personal financial disclosures of candidates and members of Congress, as well as their estimated net worth.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the site maintains an Influence &#x26; Lobbying database that tracks the amount of money specific companies, unions, trade groups, industries, and other special interest groups spend lobbying the federal government, as well as the issues they lobby on, using data from congressional lobbying records. OpenSecrets.org launched its Foreign Lobby Watch project in 2017, which allows users to see which lobbyists are lobbying for foreign clients under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which foreign entities are lobbying the U.S. government, and which U.S. government officials are meeting with foreign lobbyists.</p>\n<p>The center’s researchers have also combed through IRS 990 forms (which are filed by tax-exempt organizations, nonexempt charitable trusts, and some political organizations) and FEC disclosures to create a database of political spending by nonprofits — spending that is often referred to as “dark money,” since the donors who give to these nonprofits are typically unknown to the public.</p>\n<p>OpenSecrets.org provides its data free to the public for non-commercial use. </p>\n<p>The site also offers educational resources that explain the U.S. campaign finance system and money’s role in U.S. politics.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site’s original news and analysis pieces are balanced and factual, citing first-hand interviews, government documents, and other credible sources. Headlines accurately reflect the content. The site runs corrections in the form of a note appended at the bottom of articles.</p>\n<p>Reputable, mainstream news outlets from both sides of the political spectrum regularly cite and link to stories and data on OpenSecrets.org when reporting on campaign finance and lobbying. The site’s homepage says these outlets include Reuters, CNN, Politico, Fox News, and The New York Times. The Washington Post, The New Yorker, National Review, and many others have also recently cited the center’s work.</p>\n<p>OpenSecrets.org reporters have occasionally gotten scoops and broken news. For example, in May 2018, the site published a story with the headline “$1 million mystery gift to Trump inauguration traced to conservative legal activists.” The story, by Robert Maguire, the site’s political nonprofit investigator, found links between a shell company’s $1 million donation to President Donald Trump’s inauguration and the Federalist Society, the conservative legal group that has been instrumental in helping President Trump select his judicial nominees.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>OpenSecrets.org lists author names on news stories, and the site provides short biographies for its staff members, including the organization’s board of directors and other leadership, on an Our Team page. Some of the biographies contain links to Twitter profiles. OpenSecrets.org does not provide individual email addresses or phone numbers for reporters and other staff, but it provides two phone numbers, a fax number, and three email addresses on a Contact Us page that can be used to contact the organization. The site also provides its number on the Signal encrypted messaging app.</p>\n<p>The Center for Responsive Politics discloses all of its non-anonymous donors on OpenSecrets.org, including its largest funders, which it is not legally required to do. It also posts its annual tax returns on the site.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Center for Responsive Politics was founded in 1983 by two retired U.S. senators, Democrat Frank Church of Idaho and Republican Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania. It published the first edition of its Open Secrets book (a precursor to OpenSecrets.org) in 1990, which documented and analyzed contributions in the 1988 elections. OpenSecrets.org was registered as a domain name in 1997. When the site went live the next year, it declared itself “designed to answer a simple question: Who paid for the 1996 elections?”</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJosh Keefe\n\nEdited by:\nMelissa
