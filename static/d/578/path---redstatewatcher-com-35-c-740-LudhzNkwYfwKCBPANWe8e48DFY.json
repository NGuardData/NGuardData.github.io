The sites share the same content and post articles at the same time.</p>\n<p>The Washington Post reported that brothers Sam and Sanh Oriyavong own a Facebook page, Donald Trump For President, which had 4 million followers as of August 2018. That account regularly shares content from RedStateWave.com.</p>\n<p>The site displays advertising, which is clearly labeled as separate from news content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site publishes a running feed of breaking news stories, mostly on U.S. politics. Several story updates are often re-published with new headlines, which are regularly written with attention-grabbing words such as “BREAKING,” “Crisis,” and “Just In,” and often include exclamation points. Headlines in July and August 2018 include, “BREAKING: He Just Apologized!!” “Al Franken Returns! Look What He Just Said on Twitter!!” and “Boom! President Trump embarrasses CNN at press conference.”</p>\n<p>“Stories” usually consist of one- or two-sentence introductions to excerpts of other outlets’ news stories (such as the New York Post, FoxNews.com, and The Daily Caller), or republished tweets, photos and videos. The site often updates with new material every few minutes. Visitors see a Facebook logo encouraging them to share the post on the platform.</p>\n<p>Political stories support the Trump administration and Republican policies. A July 2018 story described a White House policy decision about affirmative action in school admissions, with the headline, “TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BREAKS FROM ANOTHER OBAMA POLICY!” In August 2018, a story on the administration’s proposed requirement that hospitals post their prices for medical procedures online is headlined “YUGE! TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FORCES HOSPITAL TO SHOW THEIR CARDS!”, and begins with the question, “Is this the beginning of lower cost health care?”</p>\n<p>Many stories focus on media coverage of politics, and are sympathetic to conservative outlets. In August 2018, the home page had a half-dozen headlines on a decision by Apple and other services to stop running content from the right-leaning site Infowars (“BREAKING: Infowars Was Just Shut Down!!”).</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The website does not produce original reporting. Its content creators, who are unknown, mostly write headlines and short text snippets around other outlets’ stories that distort or go beyond the facts.</p>\n<p>The site’s content (which is shared on RedStateWave.com and MAGANews.io) was cited multiple times over the period of a few months in 2018 for false information by independent fact-checking organizations, including PolitFact, FactCheck.org, and The Weekly Standard.</p>\n<p>FactCheck.org reported about an April 2018 story with the headline, “BREAKING: ROSENSTEIN JUST CLEARED PRESIDENT TRUMP!” The story explained that the deputy attorney general had told the president that he was not a target in a New York-based investigation of Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen -- which even if true is misleading because that investigation is separate from the special counsel’s investigation of Trump.</p>\n<p>The site fashioned its headline from a Fox News post, which ran with a different headline: “Rosenstein tells Trump he is not a target of Michael Cohen investigation.”</p>\n<p>In June 2018, The Weekly Standard identified a story that falsely reported Democratic U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters was “criminally charged” after a conservative journalist filed a police report alleging Waters swatted her hand away while she was trying to speak with the California congresswoman. The story reported that Laura Loomer filed a report with police against Waters, but prosecutors had not brought charges. A video Loomer posted of the interaction also does not appear to support Loomer’s allegation.</p>\n<p>PolitiFact cited two similar RedStateWave.com headlines, “Laura Ingraham Just Fired!”, and “BREAKING: MIKE HUCKABEE JUST FIRED!” as falsely implying that the conservative commentators had lost their jobs. In Ingraham’s case, the story stated that the Fox News host was “firing off” at Democrats, and Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, was tweeting criticism at actor Robert De Niro, who had cursed Trump on television at an awards show.</p>\n<p>An unnamed Red State Wave representative responded to PolitiFact about the headlines, saying, “Sometimes (our) titles can be a bit baity, but it was just a play on words. We have directed our people to stop using that as a title.”</p>\n<p>The site bases articles around social media posts from politicians, but often strays from the main facts of the story. For example, a post about July’s monthly unemployment report was posted with the headline “BREAKING: PELOSI IS FINISHED!!” The main story featured a tweet and statement by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi that was critical of the jobs report.</p>\n<p>RedStateWatcher.com does not publish a corrections policy, nor does it appear to publish updates if stories contain errors. RedStateWatcher.com has a “disclaimer” statement that claims owners have no control over posts, saying the respective site “is not the publisher or author of any works posted by its members. It is a passive service for storage and dissemination of the works that” the site members “may choose to post and distribute.”</p>\n<p>The same page describes the rights and responsibilities of being a site member, but does not indicate how to join or contribute. NewsGuard was not able to locate any mechanism to join or publish stories on the website.</p>\n<p>Because RedStateWatcher.com frequently publishes false and misleading headlines, inserts commentary into news stories, and fails to identify its content creators and correct mistakes, NewsGuard has determined the site publishes false content and does not gather and present information responsibly.</p>\n<p>A NewsGuard email asking to speak with Oriyavong was not returned. A phone number associated with RedStateWatcher.com did not accept voice messages. Four messages to associated Facebook accounts asking about corrections standards and editorial policies were not answered.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site does not provide information about its owners, content creators, or how to contact those involved with its operations. Stories do not list authors’ names.</p>\n<p>RedStateWatcher.com stories are published without an author’s name.</p>\n<p>Text at the bottom of the site shows a Contact Us link, but the words do not connect to any pages or an email address. The Privacy Policy link is also broken. Stories are not archived and removed after approximately one or two months.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>RedStateWatcher.com was registered in August 2015. Its companion sites were registered later.  MAGANews.io, which publishes identical content, was created in November 2017, and RedStateWave.com was registered in April 2018.</p>\n<p>A July 2016 Washington Post story identified Sam and Sanh Oriyavong as owners of RedStateWatcher.com and the Donald Trump For President Facebook account, both of which were created in August 2015. As of August 2018, the Facebook page regularly shares RedStateWave.com’s content.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJoe Danielewicz\n\nEdited by:\nAmy
