The company also owns the National Enquirer tabloid, Men’s Journal, and Star<em> </em>magazine. The site runs advertisements and sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Usmagazine.com reports on celebrity news and fashion, and provides fashion and beauty advice, recipes, and stories about animals. The site is divided into categories including News, Stylish, Entertainment, Pets, Royals, Food, Moms, and Wellness. The site regularly publishes slideshows on what people wear to major awards shows or celebrity galas. A special section in May 2018 was devoted to the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.</p>\n<p>The site also publishes videos, which range from red carpet conversations to exclusive interviews with celebrities, and provides a Celebrity Directory with biographies of the personalities it covers. Usmagazine.com includes podcasts and newsletters. A section on the site called Buzzzz-o-meter spotlights fashion and beauty trends, typically linking to products such as sneakers and sunglasses.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Staff writers produce original stories, which are credited to individual reporters or to “Us Weekly Staff.” Bylines link to author archives but do not provide any contact or biographical information. Articles frequently include quotes from anonymous sources.</p>\n<p>Unnamed individuals who claim to know about celebrities’ personal lives are often described as a “source” or “insider” in stories about celebrity breakups, new babies, and new relationships, with no indication of how the sources gained their knowledge. However, many articles quote named sources and cite information from tabloid news and gossip outlets such as TMZ, as well as news organizations like NBC News. They also often link to outside sources, and many articles and videos include direct interviews with subjects -- which is why NewsGuard did not conclude that the site generally does not gather and present news and information irresponsibly.</p>\n<p>The site does not contain a corrections policy, and NewsGuard could not find any corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site indicates it is part of American Media Inc. Celebrity News Network, but it does not disclose its editorial leadership. A Contact Us page links to a subscription form but does not provide any information about how to get in touch with writers, editors, or executives.  </p>\n<p>The bottom of the website includes a disclaimer, which states that “Us Weekly has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services.” Some posts promoting goods and services include a note stating the posts were published by Us Weekly’s “Shop With Us” team, which “may receive products free of charge from manufacturers to test” but “this does not drive our decision as to whether or not a product or service is featured or recommended.” Ads are distinguished from news content.</p>\n<p>While a copyright notice on the site identifies American Media as the owner, no additional information is disclosed about who controls American Media or about the company’s other media properties.</p>\n<p>Us Magazine did not respond to five inquiries from NewsGuard asking about the site’s approach to corrections and its lack of information about site leadership and content creators.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Us Magazine magazine was started by the The New York Times Co. in 1977, and later purchased by Jann Wenner of Wenner Media, owner of Rolling Stone magazine. The site domain was registered in 1997. American Media bought the publication in 2017.</p>\n<p>The chairman and CEO of American Media, David Pecker, is a confidant of Donald Trump’s. The company settled a lawsuit in 2018 filed by former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who sought to invalidate an agreement made with the company that prevented her from speaking publicly about an affair she claimed to have had with Trump before he was elected president in 2016. AMI denied misleading McDougal into signing a contract, and has denied other claims that the National Enquirer<em> </em>has suppressed stories about Trump or targeted his rivals.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nRachel Treisman\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.americanmediainc.com/brands/overview\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.americanmediainc.com/brands/overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-media-inc-finalizes-purchase-of-us-weekly-300445538.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-media-inc-finalizes-purchase-of-us-weekly-300445538.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.americanmediainc.com/press-release/american-media-inc-acquires-full-ownership-mr-olympia-competition\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.americanmediainc.com/press-release/american-media-inc-acquires-full-ownership-mr-olympia-competition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/people.asp?privcapId=24749\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/people.asp?privcapId=24749</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=24749\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=24749</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/pictures/royal-wedding-2018-what-prince-harry-meghan-markle-guests-wore/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/pictures/royal-wedding-2018-what-prince-harry-meghan-markle-guests-wore/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/t2-gift-set-sale/best-in-black-loose-leaf-tea-box-set/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/t2-gift-set-sale/best-in-black-loose-leaf-tea-box-set/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usmagazine.com/podcasts/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/get-tressed-with-us-marc-mena-on-hair-extensions-and-crowns/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/get-tressed-with-us-marc-mena-on-hair-extensions-and-crowns/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Us-Weekly\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.britannica.com/topic/Us-Weekly</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-a-playboy-model-and-a-system-for-concealing-infidelity-national-enquirer-karen-mcdougal\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-a-playboy-model-and-a-system-for-concealing-infidelity-national-enquirer-karen-mcdougal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/newsletter-signup/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usmagazine.com/newsletter-signup/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/buzzzz-o-meter/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usmagazine.com/buzzzz-o-meter/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/shop-with-us/news/cozy-top-rated-cardigan/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usmagazine.com/shop-with-us/news/cozy-top-rated-cardigan/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=usmagazine.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=usmagazine.com</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"usmagazine.com","author":"Rachel Treisman","date":"2018-08-06T16:49:20.101+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/usmagazine.com/"}}
