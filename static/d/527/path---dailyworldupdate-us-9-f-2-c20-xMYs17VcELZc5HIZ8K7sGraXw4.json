Blair, a former construction worker who lives in Maine, runs a network of more than 20 sites that describe themselves as satire, but are regularly shared as real news from credulous social media users. Blair has said his sites are aimed at tricking conservatives into sharing false news.</p>\n<p>Daily World Update runs advertisements, but Blair told the Boston Globe in April 2018 that his ad revenue was dwindling, due to Facebook algorithm changes and a growing awareness about disinformation on the internet. “We’ve known for a long time that this would turn into a labor of love, and we’ll gladly volunteer to keep doing it,” Blair said.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>An About page on Daily World Update states that America’s Last Line of Defense, the name used by most of the sites in Blair’s network, “is a whimsical playland of conservative satire.”</p>\n<p>Daily World Update had only published 10 stories when NewsGuard reviewed the site in January 2019. Most were related to U.S. politics and U.S. President Donald Trump. These stories, all fictional, ran under headlines including “UNCONFIRMED: West Wing Source Claims ‘Melania Has Been Dead For Days,’” “BREAKING: Trump Tower Fire Ruled Arson,” and “BREAKING: North Korea Makes Good On Promise To Trump.”</p>\n<p>Blair told The Boston Globe that his sites publish fake stories to demonstrate how easy it is to get conservatives to believe false information. He said he and his followers sometimes report sites who have shared the fake stories to Facebook. “We’re trolling conservative low-hanging fruit and having them removed from Facebook,” Blair told the Globe. “You post nonsense, they respond, you and your friends make them look foolish.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Daily World Update makes up events, quotes, and story details. In 2018, the site published stories that claimed that former Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a policy to detain Jews at the southern U.S. border; that Trump traded the state of Texas to North Korea in exchange for a collection of beads; and that two high-ranking Democrats had “officially switched their party affiliation and pledged full support of Trump.”</p>\n<p>The site discloses in multiple places that it is publishing false information. An About Us page states that “everything on this website is fiction” and that “any similarities between this site’s pure fantasy and actual people, places and events are purely coincidental.” At the bottom of each page, under a “Pay Attention” banner, the site provides a dictionary definition of the word “satire.”</p>\n<p>However, no disclaimer appears next to the headline when a story is shared on social media, so it is not always clear to readers that it is made up.</p>\n<p>In an email to NewsGuard, Blair said, “At some point, people need to be held responsible for what they believe.” He argued that by fooling and shaming readers, he is helping to curb belief in online misinformation. “We go out of our way to make sure it couldn’t possibly look real,” he said, noting that his sites provide more disclosures than the popular satire site The Onion to indicate that the content is false.</p>\n<p>Blair said his sites “are neither news nor information” and therefore “don’t qualify to be judged by [NewsGuard’s] standards.”</p>\n<p>However, because so many readers have believed, shared, and amplified the falsehoods in the sites’ stories — which are not labeled when readers encounter them on social media or in search results — NewsGuard has decided to review and rate Blair’s sites.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles on Daily World Update are credited to pseudonyms such as “Fallis Gunnington” and “Flagg Eagleton.” The site does not disclose its ownership, financing, or editorial leadership.</p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>In 2014, Blair first gained notice as Busta Troll, a liberal social media prankster. As Busta Troll, Blair conned his way into becoming an administrator of a prominent Facebook page dedicated to criticizing former POW Bowe Bergdahl, in order to replace all of the page’s content with pictures of goats.</p>\n<p>Daily World Update was created in 2018.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nMelissa Goldin\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric
