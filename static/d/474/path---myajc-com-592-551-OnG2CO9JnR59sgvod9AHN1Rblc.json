Cox owns four daily newspapers and 14 television stations in the U.S.. Cox-owned newspapers generate revenue from advertising and subscriptions to their printed and digital editions.</p>\n<p>MyAJC is the newspaper’s paid site. Another website, AJC.com, is free to readers and is more focused on the arts and entertainment scene in Atlanta.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>MyAJC.com focuses on local and state news, sports, arts, and lifestyle stories. It carries national and international news by The Associated Press and the Cox Media Group National Content Desk. The site features a food section and a Voices section, which contains opinion and data-visualization stories. MyAJC.com also publishes Politically Georgia, which provides in-depth coverage of state politics, and hosts a podcast about the local criminal justice system called Breakdown. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles on the site are balanced and well-sourced, and often are based on interviews with local officials and other named sources. Headlines are measured and reflect the content of articles.</p>\n<p>The website does not post a corrections policy, but regularly publishes corrections in the form of a note at the top of the corrected articles.</p>\n<p>Opinion is published separately from news content in the Voices section.</p>\n<p>In 2016, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published an investigative series about physicians who continued to practice medicine after being accused and sometimes convicted of sexual misconduct. The series was a finalist for the 2017 Pulitzer Prize in National Reporting.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Stories are credited to authors and link to the writer’s biography and photograph. The site’s Contact Us page names its editorial leadership, with email addresses and phone numbers, and  also provides a phone number for readers with questions or concerns.</p>\n<p>The site does not disclose ownership by Cox, other than in a copyright notice. Monica Richardson, the outlet’s senior managing editor, told NewsGuard in an email that the company is taking the matter of ownership “under advisement,” adding, “We value suggestions and feedback that might lead to a better user experience for our digital audience.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The newspaper began publishing in 1868 after the Atlanta Daily Opinion was renamed The Atlanta Constitution. The Atlanta Journal was founded in 1883. In 1950, James Cox, a former governor of Ohio the Democratic nominee for president in 1920, purchased the two papers separately and merged their Sunday editions. The two papers’ newsrooms combined in 1982. In 2001, the last edition of the Atlanta Journal was published and the paper became known The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</p>\n<p>MyAJC.com began publishing content from the two papers in 1998.</p>\n<p>Disclosure: Cox Media is a unit of Cox Enterprises, a minority investor in NewsGuard Technologies Inc., the owner of NewsGuard.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJennie Kamin\n\nEdited by:\nPeggy Ackermann&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/about/ajc-history/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ajc.com/about/ajc-history/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.coxmediagroup.com/brands/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.coxmediagroup.com/brands/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.coxenterprises.com/about-us/businesses\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.coxenterprises.com/about-us/businesses</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/online/contacts/kevin-riley/l7zCkGwtwSDcGy7dypBemL/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ajc.com/online/contacts/kevin-riley/l7zCkGwtwSDcGy7dypBemL/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-riley-83a6481/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-riley-83a6481/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.coxenterprises.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.coxenterprises.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://membercenter.myajc.com/products/\" target=\"_blank\">https://membercenter.myajc.com/products/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=117946\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=117946</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://subscribe.ajc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribe.ajc.com/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coxenterprises.com/about-us/businesses/cox-media-group\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.coxenterprises.com/about-us/businesses/cox-media-group</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.myajc.com/news/digital-extras-interactives/Oa6ADpldTZ0d6Rf4TJfOhL/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.myajc.com/news/digital-extras-interactives/Oa6ADpldTZ0d6Rf4TJfOhL/ </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/man-sought-robbery-broadcast-live-social-media/ycTu6BpbbPJ9RKrAAHhBvJ/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/man-sought-robbery-broadcast-live-social-media/ycTu6BpbbPJ9RKrAAHhBvJ/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/council-committee-rebuffs-atlanta-mayor-gulch-deal/xEW5bIXZM9BCaSfXsgTh0J/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/council-committee-rebuffs-atlanta-mayor-gulch-deal/xEW5bIXZM9BCaSfXsgTh0J/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/things-you-remember-you-actually-grew-atlanta/AnMKeHrIUAytLBfpP9ZnXL/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ajc.com/news/things-you-remember-you-actually-grew-atlanta/AnMKeHrIUAytLBfpP9ZnXL/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://politics.myajc.com/blog/politics/the-jolt-stockbridge-officials-say-they-were-sold-out-their-own-lawyers/Lp0x4ZbkZkSNtIkSlJmZZI/\" target=\"_blank\">https://politics.myajc.com/blog/politics/the-jolt-stockbridge-officials-say-they-were-sold-out-their-own-lawyers/Lp0x4ZbkZkSNtIkSlJmZZI/ </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.myajc.com/news/local/correction-cobb-school-year-will-begin-july/F6qCSsIZiHHVugysGhhuaM/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.myajc.com/news/local/correction-cobb-school-year-will-begin-july/F6qCSsIZiHHVugysGhhuaM/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/contact-us/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ajc.com/contact-us/ </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.myajc.com/staff/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.myajc.com/staff/ </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.whois.net/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.whois.net/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/about/ajc-history/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ajc.com/about/ajc-history/ </a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"myajc.com","author":"Jennie Kamin","date":"2018-10-05T20:22:55.053+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/myajc.com/"}}
