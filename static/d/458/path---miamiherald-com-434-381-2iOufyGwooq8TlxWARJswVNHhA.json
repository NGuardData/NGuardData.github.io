It is updated regularly with local breaking news, and runs national and international news from The Associated Press, as well as news videos from The New York Times.</p>\n<p>Miamiherald.com provides web-only content as well as articles from the print newspaper, including editorials and political endorsements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Stories on the site are fact-based and typically cite named sources. Editorials and opinion are clearly separated from news content, and corrections are posted frequently.</p>\n<p>The Miami Herald has been awarded the Pulitzer Prize, U.S. journalism’s highest honor, 22 times, most recently in 2017, when The Herald shared the prize for explanatory reporting with McClatchy and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists for reporting on offshore tax havens uncovered in the “Panama Papers” investigation. Cartoonist Jim Morin also won for editorial cartooning in 2017.</p>\n<p>The site posts corrections that are clearly marked and that explain what was incorrect, appended to a corrected version of the article.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site lists telephone numbers for the company’s leadership, including executive editor  Aminda \"Mindy\" Marqués Gonzalez, who became the Herald’s first Hispanic editor in 2010.</p>\n<p>The site has a detailed ‘About Us’ section with contact numbers and descriptions of other properties owned by the site’s company, including a Spanish-language site and an entertainment-focused site.</p>\n<p>It posts an email form for users to submit feedback and complaints.</p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguished from editorial content. Sponsored content is labeled “From our Advertising Partners.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The paper launched in 1903 as The Miami Evening Record. It was renamed The Miami Herald in 1910.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This Nutrition Label has been updated, and its rating has changed, after McClatchy sites began labeling paid content hosted by content recommendation firm ZergNet. The site now meets NewsGuard’s standard for labeling advertising.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEdith Honan\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.jaws.org/about-jaws/advisory-board/aminda-mindy-marques-gonzalez/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.jaws.org/about-jaws/advisory-board/aminda-mindy-marques-gonzalez/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/article109081832.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/article109081832.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/customer-service/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.miamiherald.com/customer-service/about-us/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2017\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2017</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article224080655.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article224080655.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zergnet.com/news/3640852/everything-thats-come-out-about-alan-rickman-since-he-died\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.zergnet.com/news/3640852/everything-thats-come-out-about-alan-rickman-since-he-died</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"miamiherald.com","author":"Edith Honan","date":"2019-02-22T22:47:31.631+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/miamiherald.com/"}}
