According to the Guardian’s ownership page, The Scott Trust’s “core purpose” is to “ensure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity: as a quality national newspaper without party affiliation; remaining faithful to its liberal tradition.” The Scott Trust, whose board is comprised of a dozen individuals from varying backgrounds, is also responsible for appointing the Guardian’s editor, who serves on the Trust’s board.</p>\n<p>The site derives revenue from advertisements, an optional membership program, reader contributions, and subsidies from the Scott Trust. Unlike most British newspapers, the Guardian has opted not to put a paywall on its website, relying instead on membership dues and reader contributions, stating: “We want to keep our journalism as open as we can.” The Guardian actively solicits donations across its website.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The outlet describes itself as “the world’s leading liberal voice.” In an article on the site, Katharine Viner, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, describes the “meaning and purpose” of the Guardian’s work as “holding power to account, and upholding liberal values.”</p>\n<p>The Guardian is a digital-first publication, meaning it produces a large amount of content on its website that does not appear in the print edition. The Guardian’s website also publishes articles from The Observer, its Sunday print counterpart. Theguardian.com divides its content into News, Opinion, Sport, Culture, and Lifestyle. While the newspaper runs opinion in a dedicated section, it is considered a left-of-center publication that often focuses on exposing corporate wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>Its U.S. homepage publishes breaking international news headlines at the top, with a focus on U.S. politics, business, technology, and science. The Spotlight section features longform pieces (“long reads”) and commentary on a variety of issues, such as “The making of an opioid epidemic” and “Chasing Denali: the four miners who created one of climbing's greatest mysteries.” The site also features original Guardian videos, documentaries, and photographic stories.</p>\n<p>The Guardian produces notable in-depth stories and ambitious digital projects. For example, Guardian reporters compiled a map of people killed by police in the United States for a project begun in 2015 titled “The Counted,” which led to improved recording of such incidents by the U.S. government. A 2016 project, “The Nauru Files,” provided readers with an interactive database of 2,000 leaked documents from Australia’s detention system.</p>\n<p>The Guardian has run several reporting initiatives funded by outside parties that remain editorially independent. For example, the Homelessness section features articles from “Outside in America,” a project funded by the Bill &#x26; Melinda Gates Foundation. The Rockefeller Foundation supports the “Cities” project, while the Skoll Foundation supports some of the Guardian’s climate change reporting.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Guardian articles are largely based on original reporting conducted by Guardian staff, foreign correspondents, and freelance journalists based around the world. Articles include links to credible sources, including news organizations, information sites, and government reports. The site also publishes articles from The Associated Press and other wire services.</p>\n<p>The Guardian has an “Editorial complaints and corrections” page, which explains the paper’s corrections policy and lists all corrections. The Guardian also has an internal ombudsman (“global readers’ editor”) whose job, according to the site, is “to collect, consider, investigate, respond to, and where appropriate come to a conclusion about readers’ comments, concerns, and complaints in a prompt and timely manner, from a position of independence within the paper.” In June 2017, the Guardian’s ombudsman published an extensive review of a January 2017 piece that reported that a “WhatsApp design feature means some encrypted messages could be read by third party.” In his review, titled “Flawed reporting about WhatsApp,” the ombudsman described how the “Cumulative effect of missteps led the Guardian to overstate the potential impact on the security of users’ messaging.” The original article was amended, with explanatory corrections published underneath.</p>\n<p>In recent years, the Guardian has contributed to several high-profile investigations based on leaked documents, including those provided by Edward Snowden in 2013 on the NSA surveillance program PRISM, and the Panama Papers in 2016, which revealed the offshore bank accounts of numerous public figures. The Guardian, along with The Washington Post, won the 2014 Pulitzer prize for public service for its stories on NSA surveillance. The Pulitzer committee praised the Guardian for its “revelation of widespread secret surveillance by the National Security Agency, helping through aggressive reporting to spark a debate about the relationship between the government and the public over issues of security and privacy.” </p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the Panama Papers revelations, Mossack Fonseca, the firm at the center of the global tax evasion scandal, shut down.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Glenn Greenwald, a former Guardian journalist and columnist who broke Snowden’s NSA story, wrote an article on his online news site The Intercept accusing the Guardian of contributing to the spread of “Fake News.” Specifically, Greenwald argued that the Guardian fabricated and mis-translated elements of an interview with Julian Assange conducted by a journalist from an Italian newspaper. In an update, Greenwald acknowledged that the Guardian issued a correction and retracted what he characterized as “baseless claims.”</p>\n<p>Opinion pieces are clearly labeled and separate from news content. And although the Guardian typically approaches news reporting from a liberal perspective, because the Guardian discloses that perspective, NewsGuard has determined that it does not handle the difference between news and opinion irresponsibly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Guardian articles generally name the writer, linking to biographical and contact information. The site’s extensive “About Us” page provides information about the Guardian’s U.S. management team and editorial staff, including titles and biographical and often contact information. The site’s “Contact Us” page lists several general email addresses, phone numbers, and a New York City address. A separate page provides information about every member of The Scott Trust board, as well as its annual financial reports.</p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored content are clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>In 1821, British businessman John Edward Taylor founded the Manchester Guardian, a weekly newspaper that became a daily in 1855. Editor CP Scott, who bought the paper in 1907, wrote an essay titled “A Hundred Years” in 1921, in which he outlined the Guardian’s principles: “Comment is free, but facts are sacred. ‘Propaganda’, so called, by this means is hateful. The voice of opponents no less than that of friends has a right to be heard.”</p>\n<p>In 1936, Scott’s son handed the Guardian’s ownership to the Scott Trust, which was endowed by the Scott family. The Guardian struggled to compete financially with other British newspapers throughout the 20th century, but began receiving recognition for its investigative pieces and breaking stories in the 1990s. In 1994, the Guardian began developing its online platform, ultimately announcing plans to become a digital-first publication in 2011. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling\n\nEdited
