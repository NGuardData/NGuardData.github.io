GN Media also owns several magazines circulated in the UAE and the website getthat.com, an ecommerce portal.</p>\n<p>The website runs advertisements and sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Gulf News covers international news, sports, and entertainment, with a focus on the Persian Gulf and the UAE. In addition to original coverage of the UAE, the site provides extensive coverage of the Middle East, featuring original reporting on Egypt, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Israel, Palestine, Bahrain, Yemen, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>The site has a section called How To that features advice about life in the UAE, ranging from a guide to buying a home in Dubai to instructions on how to renew a UAE ID card online. A section labeled Prayer Times provides a daily schedule of the five Muslim prayer times, based on the reader’s location.</p>\n<p>Gulf News also produces original videos, covering topics ranging from Bollywood to holiday celebrations in the UAE. The site’s Daily Business Wrap video covers business topics such as developments at Dubai International Airport and the region’s ports.</p>\n<p>Much of the international news and opinion from outside the region is provided by wire services, including the Associated Press, Reuters and The New York Times.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles on gulfnews.com generally draw on a variety of sources that present firsthand information on the subjects or events detailed in the article, including original interviews and photographs. Articles are generally fact-based, although they are often one-sided.</p>\n<p>The UAE has limited press freedom. Newspapers and other news organizations are barred by law from publishing criticism of the UAE’s political leaders and of the nation’s allies. They also cannot publish material deemed to be harmful to Islam or material that misrepresents Arab civilization and heritage.</p>\n<p>A NewsGuard review found that Gulf News appears to adhere to these restrictions. However, Gulf News does not disclose on the site that its reporting reflects the interests of the UAE political regime and that it does not report news unfavorable to the President of the UAE, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.</p>\n<p>For example, when Sheikh Khalifa was implicated by the so-called Panama Papers in 2016 for using some 30 companies in the British Virgin Islands to secretly purchase properties worldwide, Gulf News did not run articles about the scandal. However, the newspaper did report on the Panama Papers’ revelations about Nawaz Sharif, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan and an adversary of the UAE.</p>\n<p>An October 2018 news article, headlined “Khashoggi case must not be used to target Saudi Arabia,” accuses critics of UAE ally Saudi Arabia of exploiting Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder “to try and destabilise this important political and economic actor.” The author argues that the murder should be treated as an internal Saudi issue, because Khashoggi was a Saudi citizen and his death occurred on Saudi soil. (He was killed in October 2018 in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul.) Most international coverage and commentary on the case has been critical of Saudi Arabia for its apparent role in the assassination and skeptical that the Saudis will conduct a thorough investigation.</p>\n<p>The site’s reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is also often skewed. Reports on the conflict often refer to the Israel Defense Forces as “Israeli occupation troops” while the Israeli government is called the “Israeli occupation regime.” An October 2018 article stated that Israel has started three wars in Gaza since 2007, without noting that the Israeli attacks were frequently sparked by the actions of Hamas and other militant groups, including extensive rocket attacks and the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers.</p>\n<p>The site does not disclose that its reporting is approached from any particular political viewpoint, nor does it disclose the press restrictions it must follow. Therefore, NewsGuard has determined that gulfnews.com does not meet its standards for responsibly gathering and presenting information or for responsibly handling the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<p>GulfNews.com does not articulate a corrections policy, and NewsGuard could not find examples of recent corrections on the site.</p>\n<p>Gulf News did not respond to two emails from NewsGuard seeking comment on its editorial standards, including the lack of disclosure about its pro-UAE agenda and its approach to corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles include the name of the writer, but no contact information is provided and biographical information is given only for some opinion articles. Information about the newspaper’s management, including top editors, is not available on the site.</p>\n<p>The site states that it is owned by GN Media in its About Us section.</p>\n<p>Advertising and sponsored content are distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<p>Gulf News did not respond to two emails from NewsGuard seeking comment on the site’s lack of disclosure about its management and content creators.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Gulf News was founded in 1978. In 1984, it was bought by three Dubai businessmen, Obaid Humaid Al Tayer, Abdullah Hassan Al Rostamani, and Juma Al Majid — through the newly formed Al Nisr Publishing LLC, which later became GN Media. The paper started publishing online in 1996. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nLillian Childress\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Eric
