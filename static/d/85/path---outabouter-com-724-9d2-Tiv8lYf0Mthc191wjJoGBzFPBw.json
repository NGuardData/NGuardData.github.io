{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<div class=\"right-score\">Score: 0</div>\n<h1>outabouter.com&emsp; <span class=\"net-country\">(WEB - en-US)</span></h1>\n<p>The website for The Out And Abouter, a satire site that publishes made-up stories about Canadian politics and daily life.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>OutAbouter.com is owned by Paul Duncan, a self-described “journalism school dropout who was raised on satirical news shows,” such as the CBC’s “Royal Canadian Air Farce” and “This Hour Has 22 Minutes.” Duncan said he has also written articles for yacht magazines.</p>\n<p>The website earns revenue from advertising.</p>\n<p>The Out and Abouter largely focuses on spoof articles about Canadian life, although it also publishes content about American culture and other topics. Headlines on the website, written in a matter-of-fact style, include “Concerned, But Not Wanting To Offend, Canada Quietly Plants Privacy Hedge Along Entire U.S. Border,” “Area Man Dies Having Spent 93% Of The Miracle Of Existence Bitching About Immigrants” and “94% Of Canadians Admit Their Retirement Plans Rest On A Pet Becoming A Viral Sensation.”</p>\n<p>Posts are often based on real-world events. A January 2019 story (“Rand Paul Travels To Canada for Irony Bypass Surgery”) lampooned the U.S. Senator for scheduling a medical procedure within the publicly funded system after previously arguing against such programs in America. The story features quotes from fictional Canadian medical professionals, including one stating that patients that receive the fake procedure “report experiencing an 80-90% increase in the quality of their sense of the absurd following the operation.”</p>\n<p>Another January 2019 story describes the Canadian government making the unit “S--t Ton” an official measurement for commerce. A proponent for the made-up measurement is quoted saying, “‘It’s an extremely versatile classification.” The measurement, the article says, “can be used to denote a large amount of weight, volume, distance, or time, all with linguistic aplomb, and no small amount of oratorial satisfaction.’”</p>\n<p>Images are often manipulated to match content in articles. For example, a story headlined “Bipartisan Support Emerges For Plan To Build Wall With Trump On The Other Side Of It,” adds an image that appears to superimpose the back of U.S. President Donald Trump’s head near the rendering of a concrete wall with a U.S. flag waving above it.</p>\n<p>The website discloses its purpose with the line “Satire, Commentary, Satirical Commentary” just below its title. OutAbouter.com‘s About page makes tongue-in-cheek references to its satirical nature, with laudatory quotes from fictitious news outlets.</p>\n<p>Duncan told NewsGuard he experimented with including a “Satire” disclaimer within stories after Trump was elected U.S. president in 2016, but concluded “it was turning off the majority of readers (who were more than capable of detecting satire when they saw it, and felt like the warnings interrupted the foil of quasi-reality these pieces operate in).” </p>\n<p>“I decided instead to focus on crafting the headlines, photoshops, and articles themselves in such a way that most, if not all, people will quickly know that the material is a riff off of real events, and not factual in-and-of-itself,” he said, adding that cases of articles being mistaken for real news has declined.</p>\n<p>Snopes, the fact-checking website, has debunked at least one story by The Out And Abouter. In January 2017, Snopes wrote “multiple readers contacted us” asking about a report that Canada was building a privacy hedge along the U.S. border.</p>\n<p>Duncan is listed as the sole author for OutAbouter.com’s stories. An email address for the  website is posted on the About page.</p>\n<p>Duncan started the website in 2016. “I found writing the pieces to be a really enjoyable process,” he told NewsGuard. “After The Out And Abouter gained a small, but engaged, following in it’s [sic] first year - as politics heated up both in Canada and elsewhere - I realized there was an audience for this style of humour/commentary.”</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJennie Kamin\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Joe Danielewicz&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
