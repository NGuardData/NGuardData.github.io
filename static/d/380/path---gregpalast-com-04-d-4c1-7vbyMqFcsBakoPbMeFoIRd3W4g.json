The fund's stated mission is \"to support independent journalistic projects that are too difficult, risky, costly, or controversial for American newspapers, radio and television to attempt.”  </p>\n<p>The Palast Investigative Fund is in turn supported by the Sustainable Markets Foundation, according to the fund’s site. The foundation is a New York-based nonprofit that promotes environmental protection, energy efficiency, consumer rights, and good government, according to its IRS filings.</p>\n<p>Palast's work has also been supported by the left-leaning groups the Cloud Mountain Foundation, the Nation Institute, and the Puffin Foundation. </p>\n<p>The site also accepts donations from readers. An online store offers DVDs, books, and other merchandise in exchange for donations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Gregpalast.com is the personal website of Greg Palast, a journalist who mainly covers issues related to voter suppression in the U.S. Many articles and videos posted in 2018 concerned electoral issues in the southern U.S., where Palast argues that many voters were improperly blocked from voting in the 2018 midterm elections. The site also offers Palast’s commentary on national politics. </p>\n<p>A section of the site features \"Voter Purge Lists,\" some obtained through Freedom of Information requests and litigation, allowing users to search names to learn if they were removed from voter registration rolls in Colorado, Indiana, Georgia, Nebraska, Arizona, Illinois, and parts of Nevada. </p>\n<p>In October 2018, Palast released a report alleging that then Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who was elected governor in November, wrongly purged more than 340,000 names from the state’s voter rolls, supposedly because they had moved from the state. Based on an analysis of voter data, Palast claimed that these purged voters remained at their original addresses and should not have lost their right to vote in the state.</p>\n<p>That same month, Palast and a leader of a Georgia civil rights group sued Kemp in federal court, accusing him of failing to provide information regarding Georgia’s voter registration rolls and requesting the release of records related to the removal of voters' names. </p>\n<p>The site also publishes articles Palast has written for other publications, including Rolling Stone, Truthout, and Salon, along with media interviews about his work.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles on the site frequently rely on original reporting, including videos produced by Palast and site contributors. Reports feature interviews with multiple sources, including politicians, activists, and citizens. </p>\n<p>However, NewsGuard found several headlines and articles on the site that were misleading or inaccurate.</p>\n<p>For example, in an October 2018 article, titled \"Are You One of 769,436 Voters on the Colorado Purge List?\" Palast wrote that \"The Colorado voter purge list contains a whopping 769,436 names.\" However, according to the Colorado Secretary of State’s office, many of the people on that list were removed from voter rolls for reasons such as an out-of-state move, felony conviction, or death. In some cases, the office said, the registrations are still active and had not been purged. One state official told a local news outlet, 9NEWS KUSA: \"They’re just inactive, and they can reactivate by going to the polls and voting or getting online and changing their voter registration.\" KUSA reported that “In a phone interview with 9NEWS, Palast couldn’t … offer any evidence of improperly purged voter registrations.”</p>\n<p>Another October 2018 post stated in a subheading that Indiana had \"purged no less than 20,000 voters in violation of a federal court order.\" The article cited a June 2018 federal court order that barred the state from solely relying on a cross-state voter database called Crosscheck to remove voters from the rolls. </p>\n<p>However, according to the nonpartisan fact-checking organization PolitiFact, there is no evidence that Indiana’s process for removing voters violated the court order. PolitiFact said that Indiana uses various safeguards before removing voters from the rolls, including sending postcards to verify their address, and was not relying exclusively on Crosscheck. Palast acknowledged to PolitiFact that the original subheading was wrong, and it was changed to \"Indiana has purged no less than 20,000 voters, some apparently in violation of a federal court order.\" The site did not run a correction or editor’s note explaining the change.</p>\n<p>In a June 2016 post titled “How California Is Being Stolen From Sanders Right Now,\" Palast wrote that in California, \"provisional ballots are generally discarded.\" The story also claimed that \"the voting system is run mostly by the Democratic Party which is totally in Hillary’s pocket. So while the establishment party officials know of the absurd impediments to voting, they see no reason to solve these problems because it doesn’t harm 'their' voters.\"</p>\n<p>The fact-checking site Snopes.com refuted the claim a few days later, after Los Angeles County elections chief Dean Logan stated on Twitter that all provisional ballots would be processed. As for the claim that provisional ballots in the state are “generally discarded,” Logan noted that historically, the state has found that at least 80 percent of provisional ballots are valid. No evidence emerged showing that local officials were aiming to help Clinton and hurt Sanders.</p>\n<p>Gregpalast.com does not disclose a political or ideological orientation, yet articles such as the ones cited above sometimes misstate or distort facts to advance an agenda. Therefore, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. </p>\n<p>Because the site has repeatedly misrepresented facts on its prominent Voter Purge Lists section, without correction, NewsGuard has also determined that the site does not gather and present information responsibly.</p>\n<p>The website does not articulate a corrections policy, nor does it appear to issue corrections.</p>\n<p>In response to detailed questions from NewsGuard about the site’s editorial practices, including the publishing of false and misleading information and its approach to corrections, Palast did not directly respond and asked, “Who gives you the authority to determine what is correct and incorrect?”  </p>\n<p>He said in an email, inaccurately, that NewsGuard’s co-founders Steven Brill and Gordon Crovitz are affiliated with “the ultra-right wing, partisan Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute,” and added, “PLEASE DISCLOSE WHO IS PAYING YOU AND WHO IS FUNDING YOUR SITE. I see your site raised $6 million to launch. You’ve asked me for your donors …not until you send me your top 20 investors in this for-profit right-wing venture.”</p>\n<p>Palast continued: “Sorry, I will not participate in right-wing fronts pretending to provide some \"independent\" review of what’s right and wrong. If you write anything about me or my site, I demand that you include this comment.”</p>\n<p>NewsGuard has maintained a list of its top investors on its site since its launch in March 2018.</p>\n<p>A photograph published on GregPalast.com of the beating of a black teacher’s aide by neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia, was named one of Time Magazine's Top 100 Photos of 2017. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>An About page provides a biography of Greg Palast, and most stories are published under his name.</p>\n<p>The website's Contact page lists a general email address and a mailing address for the Palast Investigative Fund in Los Angeles, but it does not provide any information about its major donors and finances. </p>\n<p>The site does not run advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Gregpalast.com was created in 2000. Before pursuing a career in journalism, California-born Palast worked for the United Steelworkers of America, according to a biography on the site. He has written several books including \"Billionaires &#x26; Ballot Bandits,\" \"Armed Madhouse,\" and \"The Best Democracy Money Can Buy.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSophia Tewa\n\nEdited
