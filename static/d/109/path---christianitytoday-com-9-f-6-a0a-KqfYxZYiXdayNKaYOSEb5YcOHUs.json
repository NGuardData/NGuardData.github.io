The organization reported approximately $9.2 million in revenue in 2017, according to its IRS filings.</p>\n<p>Christianity Today International receives revenue from contributions, grants, and sales of products and services, such as ChurchSalary, which provides clients with resources for determining compensation for pastors and church staff. A subscription is required for full access to the Christianity Today website. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The magazine describes its mission as providing “thoughtful, biblical perspectives on theology, church, ministry, and culture.” The site publishes fact-based, Christian-focused coverage of U.S. and international news, as well as opinion on issues related to living a life of faith. Typical coverage has included a story about the challenges churches face in attracting young adherents; a tally of the new members of Congress according to their religious denomination; and a feature about a preacher whose “seminary” was the prison where she served a 30-year sentence in connection with the death of her toddler daughter.</p>\n<p>Christianity Today’s coverage of politics is generally limited to topics that involve religion, such as an October 2018 story about U.S. President Donald Trump’s standing among pastors and a December 2018 article about how anti-abortion groups are revamping their strategies in light of the stronger conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court. Christianity Today also covers higher education, particularly programs and policies at Christian universities.</p>\n<p>Other special sections include Pivot, a blog addressing ministerial matters such as keeping sermons fresh and managing church finances. The site’s Women section includes stories written by women that cover such topics as parenting, special-needs children, same-sex abuse in the church, and coping with infertility.</p>\n<p>The site features podcasts, including “Monday Morning Preacher,” described on the site as “for preachers by preachers.” The site also provides access to past issues of Christianity Today, which dates to 1956.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Christianity Today’s original reporting is typically fact-based and well-sourced, citing religious leaders, primary documents such as church and government reports, and credible news organizations such as ABC News and The Associated Press. Headlines accurately reflect the content.</p>\n<p>The website does not state a corrections policy but frequently publishes corrections, which generally appear in italics at the bottom of stories.</p>\n<p>News is distinguished from opinion in several ways. Although ChristianityToday.com does not have a dedicated section for opinion and commentary, the site labels individual stories as opinion or editorials. Other opinion content appears in sections that by their nature include some point of view, including The Exchange, which publishes essays about living a life faith, and the Pivot blog.</p>\n<p>In 2018, the Religion News Association recognized Christianity Today for Excellence in Magazine Overall Religion Coverage, in a category judging single magazine issues. The winning issue explored the history of lynching in America and the power a memorial can bring to commemoration and repentance. In 2017, the same organization awarded Christianity Today first-place honors for Excellence in Magazine News Religion Reporting and Excellence in Magazine Overall Religion Coverage.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site names its authors and typically provides biographical information about them, either at the bottom of stories or on a separate page. A Who We Are page identifies senior staff, as well as Christianity Today’s board members.</p>\n<p>Christianity Today discloses its ownership and names donors who have contributed more than $1,000 to the organization.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are distinguishable from editorial content.    </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Christianity Today, which calls itself a “nonprofit global media ministry,” was founded in 1956 by Graham, who was nicknamed “America’s pastor” and reached millions of people in person and through mass media. Graham served as pastor to 11 successive American presidents, from Harry S. Truman to Barack Obama. He died at age 99 in 2018.  </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nPeggy Ackermann&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
