Turner is operated by WarnerMedia, a division of AT&#x26;T, the telecommunications company which purchased Time Warner Inc. in 2018. CNN is based in Atlanta, with news and business operations also in New York City.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Like the television network, the CNN website provides around-the-clock news coverage, ranging from politics and investigative pieces to reports on health and fitness. In addition to its U.S. edition, the site hosts an international edition edited by staff based in London, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi, and Atlanta, as well as a site for CNN en Español, which provides Spanish-language news, and CNN Arabic. The site also livestreams CNN’s television channel, which is accessible to viewers through a paid subscription to a cable service provider.</p>\n<p>In its opinion section, CNN.com publishes commentary and analysis by staff CNN analysts as well as opinion pieces written by CNN contributors such as public figures, business leaders, and experts whose backgrounds are described at the top of the article.  </p>\n<p>In 2017, CNN Digital began publishing immersive stories using virtual reality.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>CNN employs a staff of over 4,000 journalists across the globe, 350 of whom work for the digital outlet. The network’s noted reporters include Christiane Amanpour, Anderson Cooper and Wolf Blitzer.</p>\n<p>The network has won many of the top honors for broadcast journalism, including multiple duPont Awards and Peabody Awards. CNN received a Peabody Award in 2018 for coverage of the loss of the Islamic State’s power in Iraq and Syria. Members of its staff won the George Polk Award in 2018 for undercover coverage of modern-day slave auctions in Libya, which launched protests around the world and an investigation by Libyan authorities.</p>\n<p>CNN has had a tense relationship with President Donald Trump since he launched his presidential candidacy. In January 2017, Trump, then the president-elect, accused the network  of reporting “fake news,” a charge he has regularly repeated on social media and during speeches. </p>\n<p>CNN has had two highly publicized stumbles in its coverage of the Trump administration. In June 2017, the network published a false story linking an administration official to a Russian fund. CNN retracted the story and three senior reporters of its elite investigations unit resigned. CNN came under fire six months later for a story about the Trump campaign’s ties to WikiLeaks, which the network later corrected.</p>\n<p>CNN’s anchors, especially Don Lemon, have regularly expressed strong anti-Trump views on what are promoted as down-the-middle news shows — a lapse in not labeling opinion that bleeds on to CNN.com when CNN’s television shows are featured as news on the website. However, CNN often signals, albeit weakly, that this is opinion with labels such as “Don’s Take” or “Lemon:” in front of a headline.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard sent two emails to CNN and one email to the press manager of Lemon’s show seeking comment about anchors’ expressions of opinion and did not receive a response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>A CNN Profiles page provides bios for its leadership and reporting staff. Article bylines link to these profiles, which also include an archive of the reporter’s  work.</p>\n<p>Its ownership is clearly stated at the bottom of the site. CNN also clearly differentiates content published on its e-commerce platform from editorial content through disclaimers, different branding and site design.</p>\n<p>CNN.com routinely publishes corrections, which are included in italics after the articles. The site also clearly distinguishes between news reports and commentary, which is labeled opinion. Backgrounds of opinion writers are disclosed at the top of articles.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>CNN was founded in 1980 with, what was then, a radically new proposition—to broadcast news all the time. This enabled the network to report stories live as they unfolded, which gave it an edge during the Gulf War in 1991. </p>\n<p>The network’s website launched in 1995, declaring soon after that its mission was to hold an “unerring commitment to objective and accurate news.” Twenty years later, it had become the most frequented online news source in the United States. To reflect the brand’s expansive presence across platforms and devices, it rebranded from CNN.com to CNN Digital.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nYemile Bucay\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/EVENTS/1996/anniversary/flashback.machine/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cnn.com/EVENTS/1996/anniversary/flashback.machine/index.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/technology/att-time-warner-trial-explained.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/technology/att-time-warner-trial-explained.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2018/02/16/cnn-digital-ratings-traffic-january-2018-number-one/\" target=\"_blank\">http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2018/02/16/cnn-digital-ratings-traffic-january-2018-number-one/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/cnn-launches-e-commerce-unit-plans-digital-news-subscriptions-in-2018-1202606263/\" target=\"_blank\">http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/cnn-launches-e-commerce-unit-plans-digital-news-subscriptions-in-2018-1202606263/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/02/trump-cnn-body-slam-tweet-unamerican-constitution\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/02/trump-cnn-body-slam-tweet-unamerican-constitution</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2017/03/07/cnn-digital-vr-virtual-reality-cnnvr/\" target=\"_blank\">http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2017/03/07/cnn-digital-vr-virtual-reality-cnnvr/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/08/24/tech/cnn-20th-birthday/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnn.com/2015/08/24/tech/cnn-20th-birthday/index.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://journalism.columbia.edu/dupont#duPont_Winners_Archive\" target=\"_blank\">https://journalism.columbia.edu/dupont#duPont<em>Winners</em>Archive</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2000/05/28/loc_kiesewetter.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2000/05/28/loc_kiesewetter.html </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/cnn-launches\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/cnn-launches </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/business/dealbook/att-time-warner-cnn.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/business/dealbook/att-time-warner-cnn.html </a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"cnn.com","author":"Yemile Bucay","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/cnn.com/"}}
