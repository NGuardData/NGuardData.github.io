Digital First generates revenue from subscriptions and advertising on its printed publications and digital products. It also operates AdTaxi, a programmatic advertising product for businesses.</p>\n<p>Digital First Media is owned by Alden Global Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund.</p>\n<p>In March 2018, the Post announced layoffs of nearly a third of its newsroom staff. The Post and the Bay Area News Group later engaged in a series of public protests and editorials against Alden’s ownership, with The Denver Post publicly describing its owners as “vulture capitalists.”</p>\n<p>DenverPost.com earns revenue through advertising and subscriptions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site publishes local and national news, sports, business, and opinion pieces. Specific categories include: Latest News, Crime &#x26; Courts, Most Popular, Celebrities, Lifestyle, and Business. National and international stories from The Associated Press and The Washington Post are also published. The site also publishes obituaries, classified ads, and real estate news.</p>\n<p>The Denver Post also produces “Cannabist,” which covers the marijuana industry in Colorado and in other states where the plant is legal.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Denver Post reporters write much of the website. Articles and headlines are straightforward and factual, and the site attributes all photographs. The publication frequently runs corrections and clarifications. The website provides a detailed ethics policy which outlines the Post’s commitment to accuracy, fairness, and transparency. In the event of an error, reporters must submit a corrections form to their supervisor.</p>\n<p>The site clearly distinguishes between news and opinion pieces. The Denver Post has won nine Pulitzer Prizes, the most recent for its coverage of the 2012 mass shooting in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado.</p>\n<p>Chuck Plunkett, the Post’s editorial page editor, resigned from his position in May 2018 after he said he was prohibited by Digital First Media from running an editorial that criticized Alden Global Capital for cutting jobs at the Post, despite the fact that the newspaper had posted a profit a year earlier. Several top reporters and editors who left the Post plan to launch an online news startup, The Colorado Sun.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The Denver Post provides detailed information about its content creators and senior management. Articles are bylined, and readers can contact authors through email addresses provided on the website. A detailed list of phone numbers of other staff members, and for specific departments, appears on the site’s “Contact Us” page. Readers can also contact executives at the publication.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Denver Post was founded in 1892 under the name the Evening Post. The website domain was registered in 1995.</p>\n<p>The Post competed for years with the daily tabloid Rocky Mountain News in Denver and the surrounding area, until the rivals entered into a joint operating agreement in 2001, and combined forces to produce the newspapers’ weekend editions. The Rocky Mountain News went out of business in 2009.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Joyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/denver-post/\" target=\"_blank\">https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/denver-post/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newshub.co.nz/world/theatre-shooting-coverage-wins-pulitzer-2013041610\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newshub.co.nz/world/theatre-shooting-coverage-wins-pulitzer-2013041610 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=140250974\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=140250974 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.westword.com/news/denver-post-layoffs-and-alden-global-capital-20-percent-profits-10092796\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.westword.com/news/denver-post-layoffs-and-alden-global-capital-20-percent-profits-10092796 </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/05/newsonomics-alden-global-capital-is-making-so-much-money-wrecking-local-journalism-it-might-not-want-to-stop-anytime-soon/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/05/newsonomics-alden-global-capital-is-making-so-much-money-wrecking-local-journalism-it-might-not-want-to-stop-anytime-soon/ </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.thecannabist.co\">https://www.thecannabist.co</a></h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thecannabist.co\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thecannabist.co</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/denver-post-digital-first-media.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cjr.org/united<em>states</em>project/denver-post-digital-first-media.php </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2018/04/06/as-vultures-circle-the-denver-post-must-be-saved/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.denverpost.com/2018/04/06/as-vultures-circle-the-denver-post-must-be-saved/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newsbank.com/libraries/colleges-universities/denver-post-1894-today\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newsbank.com/libraries/colleges-universities/denver-post-1894-today </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.westword.com/news/chuck-plunkett-quits-denver-post-after-another-hedge-fund-attack-is-spiked-10278530\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.westword.com/news/chuck-plunkett-quits-denver-post-after-another-hedge-fund-attack-is-spiked-10278530 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/next/denver-post-journalists-walk-out-in-protest-of-hedge-fund-owner/73-550045331\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/next/denver-post-journalists-walk-out-in-protest-of-hedge-fund-owner/73-550045331 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cpr.org/news/story/the-colorado-sun-to-launch-with-former-denver-post-a-team-stars-and-tech-cash\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cpr.org/news/story/the-colorado-sun-to-launch-with-former-denver-post-a-team-stars-and-tech-cash </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/ethics-policy/#errors\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.denverpost.com/ethics-policy/#errors </a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"denverpost.com","author":"Evan Haddad","date":"2018-08-21T13:57:46.675+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/denverpost.com/"}}
