In July 2014, the company announced that Integrated Whale Media Investments, a Hong Kong-based group of international investors, had purchased a majority stake in Forbes Media.</p>\n<p>The site’s revenue comes from subscriptions and advertising, including articles written and paid for by brands and companies that maintain marketing partnerships with Forbes.   </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site describes itself as “the homepage for the world’s business leaders, serving up a mix of news stories, video series, and in-depth features.” Its original written and video content focuses on the financial industry, technology, and lifestyle stories and is divided into categories including Billionaires, Innovation, Leadership, Money, Consumer, Industry, and BrandVoice. While Forbes magazine was traditionally known best for its comprehensive and often tough-minded coverage of financial trends, fluctuations, and scandals, the site has diverged from this legacy in recent years, in part as it cultivated a network of about 1,500 non-staff contributors to produce some of its online coverage.</p>\n<p>In July 2018, a redesigned version of the site was launched, including new features such as daily “Digital Cover Stories,” longform pieces that chief content officer Randall Lane described as “deliver[ing] the in-depth storytelling that generations have expected from the print magazine.” Digital Cover Stories run since the launch of the updated site include a July 2018 investigative piece, “The Inside Story Of Papa John's Toxic Culture,” which delved into questionable behavior at the pizza company. A week prior to the release of that story, Forbes broke the news that John Schnatter, the founder and chairman of Papa John’s, had used a racial slur in a conference call. Schnatter resigned from his position as chairman in the wake of the allegations.</p>\n<p>Forbes’ popular franchises include its yearly “Forbes 400” list, which ranks the wealthiest individuals in America, as well as its annual ranking of world billionaires. The company also hosts ForbesLive business and policy summits around the world.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Forbes was criticized for the November 2010 launch of its BrandVoice initiative (then called AdVoice), which allows companies to publish their own content on the Forbes site. That same month, a report on the website of the advertising industry magazine Ad Age quoted Sid Holt, the CEO of the American Society of Magazine Editors, who said of AdVoice that “[a]dvertiser-supplied content, whether in print or online, should not look like editorial content.” Until July 2018, a disclaimer above every BrandVoice article read: “Forbes BrandVoice® allows marketers to connect directly with the Forbes audience by enabling them to create content – and participate in the conversation – on the Forbes digital publishing platform. Each BrandVoice is produced by the marketer.” In July 2018, Forbes updated the disclaimer accompanying BrandVoice stories to read “Paid for by the brand.” NewsGuard deemed this disclaimer to be a sufficient disclosure of advertising, as it explicitly states that BrandVoice stories are advertisements. </p>\n<p>Forbes has faced criticism for its decision to outsource a portion of its website’s coverage to outside contributors, a model introduced in 2010 by Lewis D’Vorkin, the company’s former chief product officer. A March 2014 New York Times article described the contributor model as “improving traffic but diluting [the company’s] brand,” and Columbia Journalism Review judged much of the site’s contributor content to be “of suspect quality and journalistic value.” In February 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported that Forbes would begin paying its roughly 1,500 contributors, about 60% of whom were unpaid before this change. Forbes has also been criticized for instances of its contributors covertly accepting payments from companies in exchange for including positive coverage of their products or services in Forbes stories. NewsGuard spoke with two Forbes communications executives, who said in an email that “[o]ur contributors are very carefully selected and publish independently. We have a team of producers and editors who review the content on the site to ensure it’s up to our editorial standards….All Forbes contributors must sign a contract requiring that they adhere to a strict set of editorial guidelines when they join the network, which among other things requires them to disclose any potential conflicts of interest. If it’s discovered that they violate these guidelines, we will explore ending our relationship with this contributor and removing their content from our site.”</p>\n<p>The site’s Contact Information page includes an email address to which readers can send corrections. The site does not have a public corrections policy, but Forbes posts corrections to stories in the form of editor’s notes.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site does not list the names of its editorial staff (Steve Forbes has been the editor in chief of Forbes since 1990). Information about Forbes Media’s corporate leadership is available on that company’s website. Asked about disclosure of the site’s editorial staff, two Forbes communications executives said in an email to NewsGuard that “[t]he source of [a] story is noted alongside each of the stories posted on our site. Each editorial staffer or contributor has a bio explaining their expertise. As a business publication that is both in digital and print, we have an official masthead in our print magazine listing the editorial leadership.” Because the site does not have a masthead or list of its editorial staff, it currently does not meet NewsGuard’s standards for revealing who is in charge of the content it publishes.</p>\n<p>Visitors who wish to contact the editorial department are instructed to reach out to writers directly or to send “general editorial feedback” to an email address provided. Staff writers’ and contributors’ bylines link to biographies that often include their email addresses and social media accounts.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>From its founding by financial journalists B.C. Forbes and Walter Drey in 1917, and under the direction of editors such as Jim Michaels and sometime Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes, Forbes has been a generally unbridled defender of free markets—it once used the tagline “The Capitalist Tool”—while its reporters have often exposed business abuses by companies and anti-growth policies by governments.</p>\n<p>Forbes.com was launched in 1996 and helped legitimize online journalism with the publication of a May 1998 story, “Forbes smokes out fake New Republic story on hackers.” The article detailed how a story written by the associate editor of The New Republic, Stephen Glass, was largely fabricated. Glass was later fired and a Hollywood film about the incident, “Shattered Glass,” was released in 2003.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nNina Zweig\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Jim
