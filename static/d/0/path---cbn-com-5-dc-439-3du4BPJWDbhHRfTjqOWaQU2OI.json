Robertson’s son, Gordon, has led the organization as its chief executive since 2007 and is a host of “The 700 Club.” Pat Robertson, who also ran for president in the 1980s, still serves as CBN’s chairman. He is also the chancellor and CEO of Regent University, which he founded. </p>\n<p>According to CBN’s fiscal year 2017 tax returns, its annual revenue totaled $308 million. Almost two-thirds was raised through contributions and grants. The CBN News site also runs advertising. In 2017, Forbes ranked CBN 83rd on its list of largest U.S. charities, tracked by the amount of private contributions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Christian Broadcasting Network’s homepage includes sections for its TV shows, news, videos, radio stations, children’s content, and information about its ministry outreach. It covers national politics, money, health, and “Christian World News.” It also has a special section for articles about Israel, where CBN employs an internet producer. </p>\n<p>CBN News states its mission at the bottom of every article on its site saying, “God is everywhere — even in the news. That’s why we view every news story through the lens of faith. We are committed to delivering quality independent Christian journalism you can trust.”</p>\n<p>The content is created primarily by CBN reporters and producers, supplemented with stories from other news providers, such as The Associated Press. Many U.S. news articles are Christian-themed stories pulled from other media outlets. The site has posted articles, for example, about professional basketball player Stephen Curry’s plans to produce Christian-oriented films. Another article reported on a church hosting a memorial to honor the victims of a shooting during a Bible study. </p>\n<p>CBN’s TV network is best known for its signature program “The 700 Club,” a Christian variety show that mixes interviews, news, politics, and ministry. “The 700 Club” content is on the homepage, and its episodes and video clips are some of CBN’s most popularly shared content on social media. Full episodes of CBN News shows, including “Faith Nation,” “Christian World News,” and “Jerusalem Dateline” are also available.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>CBN News content offers a strong Christian perspective, but it is generally straightforward and cites credible sources. CBN headlines occasionally use dramatic language such as, “No More He and She, Now It’s ‘Ze’: UMinn’s Shocking Gender Agenda” and “Mob Rule: Intimidation, Threats, and Fury Against Trump Team Spark Fear of ‘Civil War.’”</p>\n<p>Video clips of “The 700 Club,” however, which are also available, regularly share disparaging opinions about the gay community and advocates for civil rights — which is why NewsGuard concluded the site does not present news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>After the 2016 mass shooting that killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, Robertson said on “The 700 Club,” “The left is having a dilemma of major proportions and I think for those of us who, you know, disagree with some of their policies, the best thing to do is to sit on the sidelines and let them kill themselves.” Following a 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Robertson suggested on “The 700 Club” that the country’s residents were suffering from a curse after making a “pact to the devil.”</p>\n<p>After the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, Robertson hosted televangelist Rev. Jerry Falwell, who said on the show that  “abortionists have got to bear some burden” for the attacks, as well as “the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle.” Robertson said, “Well, I totally concur.” </p>\n<p>CBN’s profile has been elevated under President Donald Trump’s administration. The news outlet got one of the first few TV interviews with Trump after his 2017 inauguration. CBN News added 10 staff positions to its Washington bureau after Trump was elected, according to The Hollywood Reporter.</p>\n<p>In January 2017, then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer broke from a tradition of giving The AP the first press briefing question. Instead, Spicer called on a New York Post reporter first, and then CBN.</p>\n<p>“It’s a new day in D.C. It’s a new day in the media landscape. And frankly, it’s overdue,” CBN chief political correspondent David Brody told The Washington Post in 2017 about the increased access.</p>\n<p>In its Contact CBN News Editor section, the site says it is “committed to correcting any errors.” In response to a NewsGuard inquiry, CBN spokesman Chris Roslan said editors “personally respond to those who submit corrections.” CBN News shared examples of corrections that are labeled as an editor’s note and explain what has been changed in the story.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site discloses its ownership and nonprofit status in an About CBN section, linked at the bottom of every page. It also describes the nonprofit’s mission, and the organization posts its audited financial reports on the site.</p>\n<p>CBN News articles generally appear with author names, with approximately half linking to biographies. The others link to empty pages.</p>\n<p>The site lists CBN’s leadership team, including its CEO, some of its staff, and board of directors, with biographies on the site. There are online submission forms to contact staff for CBN and CBN News.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Robertson founded the Christian Broadcasting Network in 1960 when he bought a TV station in Portsmouth, Virginia. “The 700 Club” premiered in 1966. In 1977, Robertson founded CBN Satellite Service, which later became CBN Family Channel. The network eventually was renamed ABC Family after Disney bought the network in 2001 for $5.3 billion. The network is now called Freeform and still runs “The 700 Club.”</p>\n<p>In 1978, Robertson launched Regent University. Its motto is “Christian Leadership to Change the World.” A decade later, Robertson unsuccessfully ran against George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole seeking the Republican nomination for president in 1988.</p>\n<p>In 1985 and 1986, CBN gave $250,000 per month or more to The Freedom Council, a nonprofit that worked to get Robertson elected, according to The New York Times. Nonprofits are prohibited from engaging in “political campaign activity.” CBN was fined by the Internal Revenue Service and temporarily lost its tax-exempt status.</p>\n<p><em>Corrections: An earlier version of this label erroneously reported that Robertson founded the Christian Broadcasting Network in 1960 after buying a radio station; he founded the network after buying a TV station. An earlier version of the label also mischaracterized CBN’s ranking on a Forbes list in 2017 of largest U.S. charities. Forbes ranked the charities by their private contributions, not revenue.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nMacaela Bennett\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric
