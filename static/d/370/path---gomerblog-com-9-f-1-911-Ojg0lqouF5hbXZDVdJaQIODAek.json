{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<div class=\"right-score\">Score: 82.5</div>\n<h1>gomerblog.com&emsp; <span class=\"net-country\">(WEB - en-US)</span></h1>\n<p>A satirical website featuring fictional stories about healthcare aimed at physicians and other medical professionals.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>Founded in 2013, GomerBlog publishes satirical content about the medical profession produced by the site or submitted by readers. Stories typically include fictitious accounts of common situations for healthcare professionals, such as “Half Slice of Cake Left for Night Shift,” “American Academy of Pediatrics Announces That Whatever You’re Doing Probably Fine” and “Study: Patient Satisfaction Ratings Skyrocket When Patient First Seen By ‘That One Really Slow Med Student.’” Stories are broken down by medical speciality, including OB-GYN, Anesthesiology, Nursing (both professional and student), Surgery, and Pediatrics.</p>\n<p>The site also publishes an information database, Gomerpedia. The About section of the page says, “‘From the makers of Gomerblog, meet Gomerpedia: a woefully inaccurate medical encyclopedia for the modern medical professional. Please grab your books, dump them in the trash, apply ample amounts of lighter fluid, and set on fire. Gomerpedia defines medical terms. Maybe not well, but we'll define them.” </p>\n<p>The website’s main About section acknowledges its satirical nature: “Gomerblog.com is a satirical medical news website created by a bunch of wannabe stand up comedians who ended up in healthcare.” It also describes the process for submitting articles: “If you are interested in writing medical satire for GomerBlog, send us your articles for review. Your first 2 articles will be published under ‘Gomerblog Team’. Once we have published 3 of your articles, we will promote you with a pseudonym of your choosing and we can link your blog, twitter, website, book, etc, on your author page.”</p>\n<p>NewsGuard could not find any ownership information about GomerBlog. The site’s domain name is registered through a California-based service called Proxy Protection, which allows website owners to remain anonymous. GomerBlog’s Linkedin page says it is based in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota.</p>\n<p>The website runs advertisements and operates an online store through Zazzle.com that sells mugs with GomerBlog quotes, magnets, t-shirts, and other paraphernalia.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJennie Kamin\n\nEdited by:\nJohn Gregory&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-sieli/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-sieli/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=gomerblog.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=gomerblog.com </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/proxy-protection/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/proxy-protection/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gomerblog.com/advertisinginfo/\" target=\"_blank\">https://gomerblog.com/advertisinginfo/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gomerblog.com/privacy-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">https://gomerblog.com/privacy-policy/ </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.zazzle.com/gomerblog/products\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.zazzle.com/gomerblog/products </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gomerblog.com/2018/08/half-slice-of-cake-left-for-night-shift/\" target=\"_blank\">https://gomerblog.com/2018/08/half-slice-of-cake-left-for-night-shift/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gomerblog.com/2018/06/american-academy-of-pediatrics-announces-that-whatever-youre-doing-probably-fine/\" target=\"_blank\">https://gomerblog.com/2018/06/american-academy-of-pediatrics-announces-that-whatever-youre-doing-probably-fine/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gomerblog.com/2018/08/study-patient-satisfaction/\" target=\"_blank\">https://gomerblog.com/2018/08/study-patient-satisfaction/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gomerblog.com/category/anesthesia/\" target=\"_blank\">https://gomerblog.com/category/anesthesia/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gomerblog.com/quizzes/pseudoseizure/\" target=\"_blank\">https://gomerblog.com/quizzes/pseudoseizure/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gomerblog.com/category/obgyn/\" target=\"_blank\">https://gomerblog.com/category/obgyn/ </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://gomerblog.com/category/nursing/\" target=\"_blank\">https://gomerblog.com/category/nursing/ </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gomerblog.com/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">https://gomerblog.com/about-us/ </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://gomerblog.com/disclaimer/\" target=\"_blank\">https://gomerblog.com/disclaimer/ </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/gomerblog-llc/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/gomerblog-llc/ </a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"gomerblog.com","author":"Jennie Kamin","date":"2018-10-09T18:56:02.084+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/gomerblog.com/"}}
