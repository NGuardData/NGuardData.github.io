The site began publishing again in June 2018, under the ownership of Wide Open Media Group, an independent publisher operating several websites dedicated to “Heartland consumers and their passions.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Rare focuses on shareable stories about people, animals, and entertainment. The site describes itself as “an online destination that covers the now, the weird, and the barely believable oddities that peak American curiosity.”</p>\n<p>Rare divides its coverage into topics including News, People, Animals, Entertainment, and Life. It also hosts sections focusing on patriotism, veterans, and the royal family, as well as Rare Country, which links to a separate website covering country music.</p>\n<p>In September 2018, news stories included coverage of corporal punishment in Georgia schools, fights in restaurants, and natural disasters around the U.S., among many other topics. The People section included stories about the royal family. The Rare Animals section features bizarre stories about animals and pets, often sourced from social media or videos on YouTube, such as stories about escaped goats “descending on a Boise neighborhood” and “The Story of Ernest Hemingway and His Six-Toed Cats”</p>\n<p>Rare Life, which features cooking recipes, news about recalled pharmaceutical drugs, and a wide range of weird or odd news. The site also runs some syndicated news stories from The Associated Press.</p>\n<p>Rare publishes stories on politics that overlap with lifestyles, such as stories about day-to-day life for the first family. It still hosts the coverage it ran before March 2018 on tabs that are accessible on the bottom of the homepage. The content includes news and labeled opinion stories reflecting a conservative-libertarian perspective. The news stories do not regularly insert unrelated or unlabeled opinion.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Rare does not conduct original reporting, but regularly cites multiple credible sources, including local TV stations and established media, such as CNN.</p>\n<p>Headlines are generally straightforward and reflect the content of stories. Rare does not state a corrections policy, but text above a contact form in the About Us section of the site indicates readers should use the form to suggest corrections. The site regularly ran corrections in stories before it shut down in March 2018. NewsGuard was not able to verify that Rare has run corrections since it relaunched, which is why it determined Rare does not regularly correct or clarify errors. NewsGuard sent Rare two emails seeking comment on how it handles corrections, but did not receive a response.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Rare names the authors of stories and provides biographical information about them, as well as their social media handles. The site does not identify its editors, and it only identifies its ownership by Wide Open Media Group in a Privacy Policy page. Rare has a contact form for readers to contact the site’s staff. Rare did not respond to NewsGuard’s Facebook message and two emails seeking comment on the disclosure of who is in charge of the site.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Cox Media, an Atlanta-based media company, created Rare in 2013. Although Cox owns newspapers and TV stations, Rare was the company’s first national news product. Former editor in chief Brett Decker told POLITICO, “we want to be a one-stop shop for conservatives that are looking for more than just political stuff.”</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan
