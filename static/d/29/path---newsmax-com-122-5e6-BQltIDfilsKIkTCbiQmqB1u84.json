Ruddy’s self-styled politics defy easy definition. A conservative and a critic of George W. Bush’s war in Iraq, he wrote “The Strange Death of Vincent Foster,” a book published in 1997 that promoted conspiracy theories about the suicide of a Clinton advisor. In more recent years, however, Ruddy has donated to the Clinton Foundation, called Bill Clinton “a friend,” and defended Hillary Clinton against accusations that donations to the Foundation influenced her work as Secretary of State. Though not a registered Republican, Ruddy, a former reporter for the New York Post and the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, told The Atlantic, “My sympathies are with the Republican Party.”</p>\n<p>In 2002, other investors in Newsmax were bought out by Ruddy and Richard Mellon Scaife, a conservative billionaire who died in 2014. That information is not disclosed on the site, nor is it clear who, in addition to Ruddy, now has a stake in the company.</p>\n<p>The site features advertisements, subscription services, and an online store. In a 2014 Bloomberg Business interview, Ruddy said that Newsmax generated the bulk of its revenue through newsletters. According to filings with the Federal Election Commission, between 2011 and 2016, Newsmax received nearly $2.3 million from mostly conservative political action committees for services, including online advertising and email list acquisitions. Donald J. Trump for President spent $201,073.49 on Newsmax email lists during the 2016 election.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Newsmax covers national and international politics, technology, health, and finance stories that, its Facebook page says, “the major media won’t report.” Certain articles, marked as “Newsmax Platinum,” are only available with a subscription. In addition to traditional news stories, the site runs a series entitled, “5 Minutes With…,” in which it interviews major political and media figures. Newsmax also publishes a print magazine and has a cable television network whose content is linked on the website. Ruddy told Bloomberg Business that, compared with Fox News, Newsmax TV is intended to be “more information-based rather than being vituperative and polarizing.”</p>\n<p>Newsmax.com also publishes articles from such news outlets as The Associated Press, Reuters, and Bloomberg News.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Newsmax stories generally cite reliable sources and present facts without distortion. Headlines are straightforward and accurately describe the content of articles. The mix of articles does not suggest the kind of cherry picking practiced by many conservative or liberal sites that tend to cover stories that only support their point of view. For example, on August 9, 2018, the site published “Politico Poll: Nearly Half of Voters Disapprove of Trump Vehicle Emission Plan,” and a July 29, 2018, opinion piece written by Ruddy himself, titled “Why I Oppose the White House Ban on CNN,” criticized the Trump administration’s actions.</p>\n<p>However, there have been some striking exceptions to this norm.</p>\n<p>Newsmax has published stories, particularly in its earlier years, advancing conspiracy theories, including “What Are Airplanes Spraying?” (June 2011) which alleged that the trails airplanes leave in the sky are evidence that “geo-engineering is being conducted to prevent global warming”; “Prof: Newtown Didn't Happen, Was Conspiracy To Push Gun Control” (January 2013); “Barack Obama Citizenship Scandal: 7 Facts About [the Obama] Birth Certificate Controversy” (January 2015); and “Mafia Hit Man Confesses on Newsmax TV: 'I Killed JFK.'” (August 2016)</p>\n<p>Newsmax has also been found to publish unproven or misleading claims by fact-checking organization Snopes.com. One article, published in August 2017, cited by Snopes suggested that the Justice Department was considering offering Hillary Clinton a plea bargain, when, in fact, Clinton had not been charged with any crimes. The article’s only source was anonymous.</p>\n<p>The Newsmax tagline that appears in the browser tab and search engines says the site covers “Conservative News in Politics, Health, Finance &#x26; More.” Articles written by Ruddy end with a description of Newsmax Media Inc. as “one of the country’s leading conservative news outlets.” However, nowhere else on the site does Newsmax disclose its conservative leanings, and Ruddy has told Forbes that the site strives for “a diversity of political opinions, liberals and conservatives. We really see ourselves as ‘independent.’” Its media kit, which is used to sell advertising, similarly describes the site as “a top independent news website.”</p>\n<p>Opinion pieces are typically separated from news stories on the homepage, and individual stories list the author’s name at the top or in the headline, denoting opinion.</p>\n<p>Newsmax publishes corrections of wire service stories, but rarely of originally reported Newsmax stories. The site has not corrected stories that promote conspiracy theories or that have been judged false by fact-checkers.</p>\n<p>In a phone call, Newsmax advised NewsGuard to submit questions to an email address. Newsmax did not reply to two emails to that address, or to a submitted contact form, seeking information about its approach to corrections. Nor did the site respond two emails inquiring about its promotion of conspiracy theories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency </h3>\n<p>All articles list authors’ names, and opinion pieces link to biographical information for the relevant contributors. News stories, however, provide no background or contact information for reporters. Christopher Ruddy is identified as the site’s editor-in-chief on the list of “Insider” opinion contributors, and his biography discloses his role as founder, CEO, and president of Newsmax Media Inc. However, the site does not disclose Newsmax Media Inc.’s owners.  </p>\n<p>Advertisements are not clearly labeled. Some are displayed like news stories, with photos and headlines, listed in an “Around the Web” column, or embedded within news stories as “Special” related links with titles such as “Trump’s New Tax Law Means Some Retirees in for Big Surprise.” The site’s “Specials” page mixes news stories with unlabeled advertisements that link to external sites, run with headlines such as “Forget Syria, Iraq and Ukraine - This is Where WWIII Starts.” In July 2018, an unlabeled banner ad at the top of the homepage, “Special: This Food Helps Liberals Eliminate Toxic Thoughts,” linked to a company selling a stress relief pill.</p>\n<p>Newsmax did not reply to a submitted contact form and two emails seeking comment on the lack of information about its reporters, editors, and executives, and its unlabeled advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Newsmax was founded in 1998 by Christopher Ruddy -- inspired, he said, by the Drudge Report’s impact on the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal. Drudge was the first to reveal the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship. In April 2018, Michael Clemente, a former Fox News executive, was named CEO of Newsmax TV.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJulia Press\n\nEdited by:\nJoyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;Eric
