Jackson, an African-American author, political commentator, and talk radio host, describes himself as “a self-appointed ‘Offender of the Left,’ sworn to set the record straight on the destruction of the black community at the hand of the Democratic Party.”</p>\n<p>The website runs advertisements and sells Jackson’s book.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Kevin Jackson states on Black Sphere’s Facebook page: “If there was a Nobel Peace Prize for kicking Liberals' asses, I'd have TEN of them!” The site describes Jackson as “unapologetically American, Christian, Conservative and a proud Capitalist!” </p>\n<p>Theblacksphere.com publishes originally produced content, much of it supportive of U.S. President Donald Trump and critical of Democrats, liberals, and liberal causes. The site links to Jackson’s radio show. Typical stories have run under headlines such as “Man Jumps in Alligator Enclosure: Metaphor for Democrats Win;” “Hollweirdo #MeToo Feminist ADMITS she lied to protect sexual predator;” and ”Swamp Rat Rod Rosenstein HIDING Witnesses in Flynn Case.”</p>\n<p>Some stories include racially insensitive content. For example, a November 2018 article, titled ‘Democratic Party in Georgia Under INVESTIGATION for Hacking Voting System’” said that then-Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams “has no shot at being governor of Georgia, despite her blackness and inward genitalia. Nice try for Democrats to pander, offering another dumb black chick into a political foray.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site typically bases its postings, which are often provocative and accusatory, on news and commentary published elsewhere, including social media posts, but often omits naming sources for the underlying information.</p>\n<p>For example, a December 2018 story about Central Americans migrants traveling to the U.S. stated “... when the soldiers laid down that razor wire, it wasn’t just Democrats who got the message. We reported thousands in the ‘caravan’ decided that getting into America wouldn’t be as easy as they were told. So they turned around.” No source is provided for the claim that the laying of razor wire resulted in “thousands” of migrants turning back.</p>\n<p>An article from November 2018, titled “President Trump’s UNUSUAL RESPONSE to Democrats’ Paid Invasion,” included a video from a Twitter user that depicted a train carrying military equipment. The article said of the train, ”Watch as the train carrying military equipment heads to the border states.” But other than crediting the tweet, there is no source, or evidence, for the claim that the train in the video was heading to the border. </p>\n<p>Another November 2018 article, titled “FL Democrats want non-citizens to vote,” stated that “Democrats used every trick in the book to undermine the electoral system. So they cheated their way back to power in the House. And if we could examine an honest accounting of the close elections, I assure you Republicans won.” Again, no sourcing or factual basis for the claim is provided.</p>\n<p>Because Black Sphere often makes claims based on poor or non-existent sourcing, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not meet its criteria for gathering and presenting information responsibly. </p>\n<p>The site does not articulate a corrections policy, and NewsGuard could not find examples of corrections.</p>\n<p>In response to an email from NewsGuard inquiring about the site’s editorial practices, including its sourcing standards, Kevin Jackson said in an email: “I'm not news. We are sarcasm, humor, and opinion.”</p>\n<p>With regard to corrections, Jackson said that when mistakes are found — typically because the information came from what he called “fake news” — they are corrected. “We have gotten better at detecting it,” he said. However, he did not provide examples of corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles include the writer’s name; most are attributed to Jackson. The site does not include biographies or contact details for other contributors, which is why NewsGuard has determined that it does meet the standard for providing information about content creators.</p>\n<p>Theblacksphere.com identifies Jackson as the site’s editorial leader and founder, and includes his biography in the About section. However, Jackson is not identified as the owner.</p>\n<p>Jackson did not respond to NewsGuard’s questions about the site’s lack of disclosure about its ownership and content creators.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site was launched in 2011, according to Jackson.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJennie Kamin\n\nEdited by:\nJim Warren&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/about/about-kevin-jackson/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/about/about-kevin-jackson/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://racepimping.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://racepimping.com/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/theblacksphere.net/about/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pg/theblacksphere.net/about/?ref=page_internal</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.iheart.com/podcast/966-the-kevin-jackson-s-29418043/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.iheart.com/podcast/966-the-kevin-jackson-s-29418043/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/french-police-firefighters-turn-backs-macron/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/french-police-firefighters-turn-backs-macron/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/did-mueller-receive-500000-for-uranium-one-deal/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/did-mueller-receive-500000-for-uranium-one-deal/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/2018/05/democrats-love-for-ms-13-animals/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/2018/05/democrats-love-for-ms-13-animals/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/elizabeth-warren-made-a-mistake-in-her-heritage-claims/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/elizabeth-warren-made-a-mistake-in-her-heritage-claims/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/hollweirdo-metoo-feminist-admits-she-lied/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/hollweirdo-metoo-feminist-admits-she-lied/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/president-trump-mocks-french-president/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/president-trump-mocks-french-president/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/disgraced-former-fbi-director-comey-entered-the-perjury-trap/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/disgraced-former-fbi-director-comey-entered-the-perjury-trap/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/2018/11/maxine-waters-plays-race-card/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/2018/11/maxine-waters-plays-race-card/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/hollweirdo-metoo-feminist-admits-she-lied/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/hollweirdo-metoo-feminist-admits-she-lied/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/2018/07/maxine-waters-cancels-public-appearances/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/2018/07/maxine-waters-cancels-public-appearances/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/2018/07/maxine-waters-latest-demented-declaration/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/2018/07/maxine-waters-latest-demented-declaration/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/2018/11/newsflash-kkk-was-military-arm-democrats/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/2018/11/newsflash-kkk-was-military-arm-democrats/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/trump-slows-illegal-invasion/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/trump-slows-illegal-invasion/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/2018/11/president-trump-challenges-democrats-border-fight/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/2018/11/president-trump-challenges-democrats-border-fight/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/swamp-rat-rod-rosenstein-hiding-witnesses-in-flynn-case/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/swamp-rat-rod-rosenstein-hiding-witnesses-in-flynn-case/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/about/about-kevin-jackson/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/about/about-kevin-jackson/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://theblacksphere.net/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theblacksphere.net/contact/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/about/?r=1-null_user\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.blogger.com/about/?r=1-null_user</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"theblacksphere.net","author":"Jennie Kamin","date":"2019-01-09T23:31:22.459+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/theblacksphere.net/"}}
