Visconti also manages the site’s editorial content.</p>\n<p>DiversityInc Media earns revenue through advertisements, sponsored content, events, and subscriptions to its diversity management service.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>DiversityInc says on its About page that its mission is to “bring education and clarity to the business benefits of diversity.” The site publishes articles in eight sections — Organizational Misbehavior, Haters, MeToo, Entertainment, Good News, Career Advice, Ask the CEO, and Diversity Management.</p>\n<p>Content on the site, which is mostly written by staff writers, includes reports of alleged discrimination, interviews with business leaders about their experiences with diversity, and commentary on current events. Typical articles on have run under headlines such as “Good News: Paula Dance is North Carolina's First Black Female Sheriff;” “Police Wrongfully Arrest Young Black Man in Oregon;” and “Viral Video of 'Grey's Anatomy' Star Shows How White Women Can Be Allies for Women of Color.”​</p>\n<p>Site CEO Visconti writes a column — formerly called “Ask the White Guy,” renamed “Ask the CEO” — in which he addresses questions about race, culture, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and age.</p>\n<p>DiversityInc publishes an annual ranking of what the site deems the “top 50 companies for diversity.” Companies are ranked according to their talent pipeline, talent development, leadership accountability, and supply-chain diversity. DiversityInc.com also features information about its webinars and events.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>DiversityInc stories are typically well-reported and fact-based, citing first-hand interviews, reports from reputable media outlets, and primary source documents such as government data.  Headlines accurately reflect content.</p>\n<p>Some articles contain the writer’s opinion. For example, a November 2018 article about a controversial arrest of an African-American man states, “[A]las, it’s just another day in America when you’re Black.” However, NewsGuard did not find instances of misstated facts used to advance DiversityInc.com’s agenda, and therefore has determined that the site handles the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>The site does not state a corrections policy, and NewsGuard could find only one example of a correction published since 2017.</p>\n<p>In response to NewsGuard’s question about DiversityInc’s approach to corrections, site CEO Visconti requested more information about NewsGuard, which was provided. However, Visconti did not respond to further inquiries.<br></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles on DiversityInc.com name the author and link to an archive of the writer’s work. Some authors provide links to their social media profiles, but because this practice is inconsistent and no other biographical or contact information is provided, NewsGuard has determined that DiversityInc does not provide information about its content creators.</p>\n<p>The About page states that Visconti “directs all editorial and business operations” of DiversityInc. However, no additional contact or biographical information is provided about those in charge of the content, and a biography of Visconti is not clearly linked anywhere on the site. Therefore, NewsGuard has determined that DiversityInc does not provide information about those in charge.</p>\n<p>DiversityInc’s ownership by Visconti, through DiversityInc Media, is disclosed on the site’s About page.</p>\n<p>The site houses a section called Featured Partner Content that consists of articles provided by companies and brands, including Humana, Toyota, and Novartis. However, there is no clear indication that these articles were supplied by the brands that the articles promote. Because NewGuard does not consider the tag “partner content” to be a clear disclosure that the content is sponsored, the site does not meet the standard for labeling advertising.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard asked Visconti about the site’s lack of disclosure of its content creators and site leaders and about its labeling of advertising, but received no response other than his inquiry about NewsGuard.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>According to the site’s About page, DiversityInc was founded in 1998. The DiversityInc.com domain name was created the same year.</p>\n<p>In 2006, Visconti founded the DiversityInc Foundation, a tax-exempt, 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Its mission, according to an About page on DiversityInc.com, is to “support and fund higher education.” The foundation says that it has distributed more than $2 million in scholarships and grants since its founding.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJulia Press\n\nEdited by:\nMelissa Goldin&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
