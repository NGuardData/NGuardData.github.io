CNHI is a subsidiary of Raycom Media, a privately held Montgomery, Alabama-based broadcast company. Raycom announced in June 2018 that it would be purchased by Gray Television, a publicly traded, Atlanta-based media company, for $3.6 billion. CNHI wouldl not be acquired by Gray as a part of this deal.</p>\n<p>The site derives revenue from advertising and subscription fees.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Eagletribune.com covers government, politics, business, entertainment, and sports in the Merrimack Valley in northeastern Massachusetts and parts of southern New Hampshire. Most of the site’s local coverage is produced by staff reporters. State, national, and international content is provided by The Associated Press.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles generally use measured language and reference multiple, first-hand sources. Headlines accurately reflect content.</p>\n<p>Eagletribune.com regularly posts corrections to its articles, generally by appending a short editor’s note at the top of the article and a full-length correction at the end, explaining the error and how it was corrected.  </p>\n<p>Opinion is published in a separate section.</p>\n<p>The paper’s reporting on the Massachusetts prison furlough program, which won the Pulitzer Prize in General News Reporting in 1988, helped lead to abolishment of the state’s use of furloughs for people convicted of first-degree murder.</p>\n<p>In 2003, it won another Pulitzer Prize, in the category of Breaking News Reporting, for its coverage of the accidental drowning of four boys in the Merrimack River.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles typically include the name of the writer, along with contact information. The site provides biographical and contact information for its management and news staff.</p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguished from news content.</p>\n<p>The site indicates in its About Us and Contact Us sections that it is part of the North of Boston Media Group, but does not disclose that it is owned by CNHI or Raycom. The Eagle Tribune's senior digital editor, Alexandra Nicholas, said in a phone interview with NewsGuard that the template for the Eagle-Tribune’s website is provided by CNHI. She also said that the outlet refers to its ownership in articles about the newspaper.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Eagle-Tribune launched as The Essex Eagle in 1867.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nLillian Childress\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gray-and-raycom-to-combine-in-a-3-6-billion-transaction-300671284.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gray-and-raycom-to-combine-in-a-3-6-billion-transaction-300671284.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.raycommedia.com/gray-and-raycom-to-combine-in-a-3-6-billion-transaction/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.raycommedia.com/gray-and-raycom-to-combine-in-a-3-6-billion-transaction/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.raycommedia.com/companies/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.raycommedia.com/companies/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnhi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnhi.com/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.eagletribune.com/site/about-us.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.eagletribune.com/site/about-us.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/staff-56\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/staff-56</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/staff-23\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/staff-23</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.eagletribune.com/news/merrimack_valley/bay-state-s-elevators-out-again/article_6b53e76a-3cda-5de9-9253-fe3b5a0dd0b7.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.eagletribune.com/news/merrimack<em>valley/bay-state-s-elevators-out-again/article</em>6b53e76a-3cda-5de9-9253-fe3b5a0dd0b7.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.eagletribune.com/news/north_of_boston/suit-accuses-tv-psychiatrist-of-inappropriate-actions-with-patient/article_bcce6f7d-277e-50fa-9843-87ab53aaf4f6.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.eagletribune.com/news/north<em>of</em>boston/suit-accuses-tv-psychiatrist-of-inappropriate-actions-with-patient/article_bcce6f7d-277e-50fa-9843-87ab53aaf4f6.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alan-eagleson/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alan-eagleson/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/russ-conway\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/russ-conway</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.si.com/vault/1996/02/19/210076/man-on-a-mission-russ-conways-investigative-work-may-bring-down-a-hockey-power-broker\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.si.com/vault/1996/02/19/210076/man-on-a-mission-russ-conways-investigative-work-may-bring-down-a-hockey-power-broker</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/05/13/willie-horton-revisited\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/05/13/willie-horton-revisited</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.eagletribune.com/site/about-us.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.eagletribune.com/site/about-us.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.eagletribune.com/site/contact-us.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.eagletribune.com/site/contact-us.html</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eagletribune.com/news/eagle-tribune-parent-company-up-for-sale/article_bbee9ac4-2edd-575d-9a09-cbf7c613cfea.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eagletribune.com/news/eagle-tribune-parent-company-up-for-sale/article_bbee9ac4-2edd-575d-9a09-cbf7c613cfea.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.eagletribune.com/site/about-us.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.eagletribune.com/site/about-us.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"eagletribune.com","author":"Lillian Childress","date":"2018-11-08T23:02:40.844+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/eagletribune.com/"}}
