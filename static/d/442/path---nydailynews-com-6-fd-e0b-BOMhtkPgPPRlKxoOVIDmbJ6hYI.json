Tribune, then known as Tronc Inc., bought the financially struggling publication from billionaire Mortimer Zuckerman in 2017 for $1, assuming all of its debt. Zuckerman had paid $36 million for the newspaper in 1993. In July 2018, the company announced it would reduce the Daily News staff by 50 percent and that its two top editors were leaving. The company said in an unsigned memo that it hoped “to capture the opportunities ahead and address the significant financial challenges we have faced for years” by focusing its staff on breaking news, local news and sports.</p>\n<p>NYDailynews.com makes money from advertising. In 2018, it started charging online visitors a digital subscription fee after they read a select number of monthly articles.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Daily News, which calls itself  “New York’s Hometown Newspaper,” publishes original  reporting on New York politics, crime and courts, sports, business, entertainment, and neighborhoods. Its staff has also produced national, international, and entertainment stories that are trending online, often based on reporting by other organizations. </p>\n<p>In July 2018, when it announced a restructuring that would cut its newsroom in half, Tronc said the Daily News would focus on breaking news, particularly in the areas of crime, civil justice, and public responsibility. “We know our readers look to us for a unique point of view, and we believe these topics offer our best opportunity to differentiate our reporting,” an unsigned memo by Tronc read. It didn’t say which coverage areas would be de-emphasized.</p>\n<p>Like its city tabloid rival the New York Post, the Daily News is famous for large-font headlines, featuring sometimes clever, sometimes outrageous wordplay. “Slime’s Up,” read a headline  from May 2018, after film producer Harvey Weinstein was charged with sexual assault in New York, playing off the “Time’s Up” movement that the revelations against Weinstein provoked. “Fraud In The Family,” ran a June 2018 headline, following a state lawsuit accusing President Trump’s charitable foundation of misusing funds.</p>\n<p>Daily News reporters have long worked from City Hall, police headquarters, the state capital in Albany, and state and federal courthouses. Coverage of the city’s eight professional sports teams get dedicated sections. Reporters also cover entertainment and gossip.</p>\n<p>The site updates with breaking news updates several times a day. Video clips are prominently embedded in text stories. Daily News front pages for the print edition are part of a scrollable gallery online and shared widely on social media. NYDailynews.com also publishes local, national and international news from The Associated Press and Reuters.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Daily News often posts exclusive news based on firsthand interviews or government and business documents its reporters obtain. Its reporters also cite unnamed sources, sometimes identified as members of “law enforcement” or people “with knowledge.”</p>\n<p>Stories based on reports the Daily News has not independently confirmed often use the words “reportedly” and cite the source, which might be well-known news outlets, but might also be videos posted on Facebook.</p>\n<p>The Daily News has received 11 Pulitzer Prizes, including six for editorial writing and commentary. In 2017, it received the Public Service award in collaboration with nonprofit ProPublica for documenting widespread abuse of eviction rules by New York police that largely affected poor minorities. It was the first outlet to release a video of a city police officer restraining a Staten Island man named Eric Garner in a chokehold, which resulted in his death in 2014. The Garner case drew nationwide outrage and renewed attention to police brutality.</p>\n<p>The Daily News’ editorial board has endorsed both Republican and Democratic candidates. In October 2016, it published an 8,000-word, 14-chapter editorial against Donald Trump’s election as president, titled “Bury Trump In A Landslide.”</p>\n<p>President Trump, whose divorces and real estate deals had been frequent staples for the tabloid in the 1990s, was the subject of pointed, critical front-page stories after he announced his candidacy in 2015. The News ran the headline “Clown runs for Prez” after he announced, and a picture of Trump altered with clown makeup. In different news cycles, front-page headlines have referred to Trump as “LIAR,” “Craven,” and “S**T for brains.” In addition, a December 2015 cover, “God Isn’t Fixing This,” next to social media posts of Republicans offering “prayers” for 14 victims of a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, made worldwide headlines. </p>\n<p>After a leadership change and staff reductions were announced in the summer of 2018, however, the front pages showed a more measured use of opinion.</p>\n<p>NYDailynews.com’s stories are updated frequently, but a NewsGuard review did not find corrections noted for those stories.</p>\n<p>Four emails and two voice messages left with Daily News editors and the newspaper’s owners asking about corrections and editorial policies were not returned.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>NYDailynews.com columns and editorials are in a separately labeled opinion section, but sometimes are promoted on its front page, with notations like “News Says.”</p>\n<p>The Daily News does not identify its owner on its main contact page, although the privacy policy identifies Tribune Publishing, and the newspaper published a banner headline and story in 2017 when Zuckerman sold the Daily News. Users can click on a reporter’s photo or byline, and find email addresses, social media contacts, and occasional profiles.</p>\n<p>The site does not list the organization’s top editors. A Contact Us tab at the bottom of the home page provide general contact numbers for the newsroom, an email address to send letters to the editor, and advertiser information.</p>\n<p>NYDailyNews.com did not appear to have written a story on the dismissal of its managing editor, Robert Moore, and Sunday editor, Alexander Jones, early in 2018 after female employees accused them of sexual harassment. The newspaper’s owner confirmed the dismissals to several national media outlets. NYDailyNews.com did publish a news story on the newspaper’s staff reductions in July 2018, as well as an opinion piece airing reader comments.</p>\n<p>Four emails to editors at the Daily News and two phone calls to its newsroom and to the newspaper’s owners seeking information about its disclosure of leadership and of the editors it dismissed have not been returned.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Joseph Medill Patterson, a former publisher of the Chicago Tribune, used London tabloids as inspiration for the Daily News, which first went on city newsstands in 1919. It was known for decades as “New York’s Picture Newspaper.” The logo of a camera still appears online and in the paper.</p>\n<p>The News featured multiple famous columnists include Liz Smith, Pete Hamill, Jimmy Breslin, and George Rush and Joanna Molloy, who wrote the “Rush &#x26; Molloy” gossip column until 2010. Mike McAlary also won a Pulitzer Prize for columns on Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant who was sodomized and tortured in a Brooklyn police station.</p>\n<p>In 1975, after then-President Gerald Ford said in a speech he would veto any bill that would help New York City avoid bankruptcy, the Daily News responded with an iconic headline, “Ford to City: Drop Dead.” Ford never said those words and later complained it hurt his presidency.</p>\n<p>The Daily News suffered repeated financial setbacks, including a period of bankruptcy, until 1993, when Zuckerman, a real estate mogul who once owned The Atlantic magazine and still owns U.S. News &#x26; World Report, bought the paper. During his tenure the paper lost circulation and ad revenues, causing layoffs and buyouts. Tronc assumed over $60 million in liabilities when it bought the organization in 2017.</p>\n<p>Tronc announced in July 2018 it would slash its newsroom staff in half to focus on its digital product and breaking news. It replaced editor-in-chief Jim Rich, who had been on the job for just under six months, with Robert York, a publisher of the Allentown (Pennsylvania) Morning Call.</p>\n<p>The Chicago-based Tronc was founded as Tribune Publishing in 2014, changed its name to Tronc in 2016, and opted to return its official name to Tribune Publishing Company in 2018.</p>\n<p><em>Disclosure: NewsGuard executive editor Jim Warren was chief of the Daily News’ Washington bureau from early 2013 until the middle of 2016.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nAmy Westfeldt\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Joyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/04/business/new-york-daily-news-sale-tronc.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/04/business/new-york-daily-news-sale-tronc.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/11/28/tronc-starts-swinging-the-ax-at-the-daily-news/\" target=\"_blank\">https://nypost.com/2017/11/28/tronc-starts-swinging-the-ax-at-the-daily-news/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/message-readers-article-1.3792809\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/message-readers-article-1.3792809</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-daily-news-m-a-tronc/tronc-buys-new-york-daily-news-in-push-into-no-1-media-market-idUSKCN1BG09O?utm_source=applenews\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-daily-news-m-a-tronc/tronc-buys-new-york-daily-news-in-push-into-no-1-media-market-idUSKCN1BG09O?utm_source=applenews</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-york-daily-news-front-pages-2018-gallery-1.3732896\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-york-daily-news-front-pages-2018-gallery-1.3732896</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nydailynews.com</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-york-daily-news-front-pages-2018-gallery-1.3732896\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-york-daily-news-front-pages-2018-gallery-1.3732896</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://journalisms.theroot.com/rob-moore-2nd-editor-out-at-n-y-daily-news-amid-sexua-1822709397\" target=\"_blank\">https://journalisms.theroot.com/rob-moore-2nd-editor-out-at-n-y-daily-news-amid-sexua-1822709397</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3> </h3>\n</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/services/contact-us#nt=footer\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nydailynews.com/services/contact-us#nt=footer</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tronc.com/privacy-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tronc.com/privacy-policy/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/New-York-Daily-News\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.britannica.com/topic/New-York-Daily-News</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-edit-99-years-young-20180625-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-edit-99-years-young-20180625-story.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mortimer-b-zuckerman-rescued-new-york-daily-news-demise-article-1.3472081\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mortimer-b-zuckerman-rescued-new-york-daily-news-demise-article-1.3472081</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/videos/money/business/2017/09/10/key-moments-history-new-york-daily-news/105283472//\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usatoday.com/videos/money/business/2017/09/10/key-moments-history-new-york-daily-news/105283472//</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/28/nyregion/28veto.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/28/nyregion/28veto.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1593195/000159319517000069/a20178-kdailynews.htm\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1593195/000159319517000069/a20178-kdailynews.htm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-news-tronc-name-tribune-publishing-20181004-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-news-tronc-name-tribune-publishing-20181004-story.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"nydailynews.com","author":"Amy Westfeldt","date":"2018-10-11T19:02:31.614+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/nydailynews.com/"}}
