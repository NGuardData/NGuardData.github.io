The Walt Disney Company is a publicly traded media and entertainment company based in Burbank, California. In addition to its Disney/ABC Television Group, which comprises the company’s entertainment and news television holdings such as ABC, Disney Channels, and Freeform, Disney holds ownership stakes in ESPN Inc, A+E Networks, and online streaming service Hulu. </p>\n<p>The site runs advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>ABC News covers U.S. and international news about politics, entertainment, health, weather, business, and lifestyle through video and text. Visitors to the site can also stream news live. In addition to video clips from local and national ABC television news programs, the site has a special section for “ABC News Features,” the network’s series of short documentaries that includes topics such as “Under Review: Transgender troops on Trump’s proposed ban;” “‘Hora Cero’: Venezuela’s crisis through a mother’s eyes;” and “How Long Island’s former ‘Tupperware queen’ came out as her true self.” An Investigative page features in-depth reporting from local ABC affiliate stations.</p>\n<p>The website provides links to ABC News’ nationally broadcast programming, which, includes the country’s most-watched newscast, “World News Tonight,” and most-watched morning show, “Good Morning America.” Other shows linked on the site include “Nightline,” a late-night news program; “20/20,” an investigative journalism series; “This Week,” a Sunday interview and panel-based political analysis show; “The View,” a daytime talk show; and “What Would You Do?”, a hidden camera program.</p>\n<p>The site also features articles written by ABC’s journalists, accompanied by photos and video clips from news programs. The ABC News team includes many well-known journalists, including David Muir, George Stephanopoulos, Robin Roberts, and Juju Chang. In addition to originally reported stories, the website publishes content from The Associated Press, ESPN, and other news providers.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Stories on ABCNews.Go.com are typically fact-based, often relying on original reporting by the network’s extensive team of reporters and producers, or citing other credible news outlets. Headlines accurately represent content. The website does not have a dedicated opinion section, but opinion and analysis articles, such as sports columns supplied by The Associated Press, are identified with the word “Column” in the headline. </p>\n<p>Reporting errors are typically addressed at the bottom of stories, either by a correction notice or an editor’s note, stating the mistake and how the story was updated.</p>\n<p>In December 2017, the ABC was forced to respond to a high-profile error involving the network’s then chief investigative correspondent, Brian Ross, who incorrectly reported that President Trump had asked retired three-star Lt. General Michael Flynn to contact Russia during his campaign. The only available evidence was that Trump did so after he won the election, not during the campaign. </p>\n<p>ABC News initially responded to the error with a “clarification,” but following widespread criticism, it revised its characterization to a more serious “correction.” Ross was suspended for four weeks without pay and returned to work in January 2018 to focus on long-term projects rather than on breaking news, and would no longer cover Trump, according to a statement by ABC News. In July 2018, Ross left the network, along with Rhonda Schwartz, the chief investigative producer for Ross’ team.</p>\n<p>In 2015, George Stephanopoulos, the network’s chief anchor and chief political correspondent and co-anchor of “Good Morning America,” apologized on-air for not disclosing that he made $75,000 in donations to the Clinton Foundation between 2012 and 2014. Hillary Clinton was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination during that period; Stephanopoulos, who had served as a top advisor to President Bill Clinton, regularly reported on her campaign. </p>\n<p>“Even though I made them strictly to support work done to stop the spread of AIDS, help children and protect the environment in poor countries, I should have gone the extra mile to avoid even the appearance of conflict,” Stephanopoulos said. ABC News said he violated its rules for failing to disclose the charitable donations.</p>\n<p>ABC News has been recognized with many national honors for its journalism. The network has received nearly three dozen Peabody Awards, the oldest major U.S. award for electronic media, for its various news programs and general news coverage. Most recently, ABC News won two Peabody awards in 2012 for coverage of Superstorm Sandy and for anchor Robin Roberts’ reports on a blood disorder that she was battling. ABC News has also received multiple News &#x26; Documentary Emmy Awards, five in 2017, including Outstanding Feature Story in a Newscast for coverage of a Syrian refugee family’s journey, and Outstanding Hard News Feature Story in a Newscast for “Gang Land,” a special report by “Nightline.”</p>\n<p>In 2017, ABC News won an Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award, considered the broadcast equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize. The award was given to the network, in conjunction with Hollywood director John Ridley, for a 2017 documentary on the 1992 Los Angeles riots. ABC News has won multiple Edward R. Murrow Awards for outstanding achievement in journalism, including recent wins in the Website and Newscast categories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Stories on the ABC News website list the names of the journalists who produced the story. However, contact details, such as an email address or Twitter account, is often not provided for the site’s content creators, and nor is biographical information.</p>\n<p>ABCNews.Go.com does not provide a list of editorial managers or executives. Visitors must go to Disney’s corporate website to learn about ABC News’ executives. </p>\n<p>Disney’s ownership of ABC News is not promently disclosed on the site. At the bottom of the website, a copyright reads “ABC News Internet Ventures. Yahoo! - ABC News Network.” The Contact Us page does not mention Disney. (Stories on ABCNews.Go.com that reference Disney and its products contain a disclosure that Disney is ABC’s parent company.)</p>\n<p>Julie Townsend, vice president of news communication for ABC, did not respond to three emails and a phone call seeking comment about the site’s handling of disclosures about its ownership, leadership, and content creators.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The American Broadcasting Company’s history as a news organization dates to early-1940s radio. The company began airing regular televised broadcasts in 1948 with the network’s initial owned-and-operated television station and production center in New York City. </p>\n<p>For decades, ABC News consistently ranked third in viewership behind CBS and NBC. In recent years, it has regularly competed with NBC News for the highest-rated morning and evening news programs. In 1976, Barbara Walters became the first woman to co-anchor a nightly television newscast when she teamed up with Harry Reasoner on “ABC Evening News.”</p>\n<p>The network launched its first website, ABCNews.com, in 1997.  </p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: After further review, this Nutrition Label has been updated to reflect that the site does not meet NewsGuard’s standards for clearly displaying
