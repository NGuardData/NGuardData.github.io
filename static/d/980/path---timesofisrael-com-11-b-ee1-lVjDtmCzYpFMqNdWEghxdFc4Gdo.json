The website regularly covers the Trump administration’s efforts to negotiate peace between the Palestinians and Israelis, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and geopolitical issues with Iran and Syria.</p>\n<p>The website runs separate opinion columns on Israel politics and life in a separate section. Other sections include “Israel Inside,” with personal features such as the struggles of a Jewish-Arab marriage, and a section dedicated to Israel’s burgeoning startup industry and opinion columns.</p>\n<p>The site publishes content from Israel, the U.S., and the MIddle East from The Associated Press and the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Times of Israel’s original reporting attributes information to firsthand sources, including interviews, court documents, and statements from public officials. The website lists a staff of more than two dozen editors and reporters. </p>\n<p>The website distinguishes between fact-based news and opinion content published exclusively in its blog section. Headlines and images published on the site accurately reflect the content of stories.</p>\n<p>In its About Us section, the site says it has “no partisan political affiliation,” adding that it “seeks to present the news fair-mindedly and offers a wide range of analysis and opinion pieces...We aim for the site to serve as a platform for constructive debate regarding the challenges facing Israel, the region and the Jewish people.” </p>\n<p>The newspaper primarily takes an objective, centrist position on Palestinian-Israeli issues, providing coverage of issues that affect both Palestinians and Israelis, a NewsGuard review found. For example, a September 2018 story titled, “Riots break out as police demolish homes in Palestinian village” reported on the Israeli police’s use of force, as well as injuries sustained. Another story titled, “Gazans clash with Israeli troops at weekly demonstration along border,” also interviewed both Palestinian and Israeli sources, including the Gaza health ministry, which the newspaper identified as Hamas-run, as well as Israel Defense Force officials.</p>\n<p>The website runs corrections at the tops or bottoms of relevant articles. “When we get things wrong, we correct them. If the error is significant, we draw readers’ attention to the change with an editor’s note in the article or a separate correction,” Horovitz, the managing editor, wrote to NewsGuard.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The Times of Israel lists information about its founders, board members, editors, and content creators, including biographies for staff reporters and columnists. Stories are credited to authors, although their contact information is not always available. The site’s contact page provides a mailing address and a phone number as well as a contact form.</p>\n<p>The website, in its About Us page, explained why it discourages anonymous comment to posts.</p>\n<p>“We aim for the site to serve as a platform for constructive debate regarding the challenges facing Israel, the region and the Jewish people. Rather than enabling anonymous posting, therefore, we encourage our readers to respond to our material in their own names via Facebook,” the website states in its About Us section.</p>\n<p>Advertisements on the site are clearly distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Times of Israel was founded in 2012 by American hedge fund manager Seth Klarman and  Horovitz, who is also the site’s managing editor.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJennie Kamin\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Yemile
