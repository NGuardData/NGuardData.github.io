In response to Abdullah’s signing of a public declaration of support for Hamas in 2009, the British government severed ties with the MCB for nearly a year. (The British government has listed Hamas as a “proscribed terrorist organisation” since 2001.) When the government restored ties with the MCB in January 2010, it said it would continue to shun Abdullah, The Telegraph reported. </p>\n<p>While serving at the MCB, Abdullah participated in the organization’s boycott of Holocaust Memorial Day, an internationally recognized commemoration of the millions of Jews killed by the Nazi regime during World War II, as well as victims of subsequent genocides. The boycott, which advocated for the event to take a more general mission and name, such as “Genocide Memorial Day,” ended in 2007 after some MCB leaders acknowledged it was “inadvertently causing hurt to some in the Jewish community.” Abdullah opposed ending the boycott, telling The Guardian that “nothing has changed.”   </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>MiddleEastMonitor.com publishes news, opinions, reviews, interviews, and video and photo stories about the Middle East and North Africa. Multimedia features include infographics and videos of speeches from conferences hosted by the site. These conferences typically address policy challenges in Middle East and feature addresses from academics, as well as prominent U.K. politicians. There is also a Spanish language version of the site. </p>\n<p>The site hosts reports published by third-party organizations, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem.</p>\n<p>In 2011, a BBC News report referred to MiddleEastMonitor.com as a “pro-Hamas publication” in reference to its hosting of Raed Salah, an Israeli-Arab sheikh who has invoked conspiracy theories about Jewish complicity in the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site states on its About Us page that it was established to provide a forum for “supporters of the Palestinian cause to master the art of information gathering, analysis and dissemination.” An Editorial Guidelines document posted on the site states that Middle East Monitor “promotes the restoration of Palestinian rights, including the Right of Return, a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital and democratic rights upheld. It also advocates a nuclear-free Middle East.” </p>\n<p>This mission is reflected in MiddleEastMonitor.com’s coverage, with stories such as “Medical Aid for Palestinians attacked by pro-Israel lawyers’ groups,” “Jewish settlers burn dozens of olive trees in occupied West Bank,” and “Settler runs over Palestine child in West Bank.” The site frequently posts articles about the progress of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, a global campaign that advocates boycotting Israel and its products.</p>\n<p>Many news articles on the site are fact-based, even if they are written from a strong pro-Palestinian viewpoint, and often cite the reporting of credible news outlets. The homepage links to separate sections for news and opinion.</p>\n<p>However, individual articles are not clearly labeled. So a reader who arrives on an opinion article page via search or social media would have little indication it was an opinion. Moreover, NewsGuard found some articles tagged as “news” that state opinions as established fact.</p>\n<p>Articles posted in summer 2018 about charges of anti-Semitism lodged against UK Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, for example, often crossed the line from news to opinion. One story stated that the BBC has “an ongoing campaign to discredit” Corbyn and has “allowed itself to be used to advance a false narrative.” There is no evidence that the BBc has participated in a “campaign to discredit” Corbyn. </p>\n<p>Another article claimed that Margaret Hodge, a Labour lawmaker, was “universally condemned by Jews and non-Jews alike for comparing the Labour Party under Corbyn to Germany under Hitler.” In fact, many observers expressed sympathy for Hodge’s remarks.</p>\n<p>Although the site acknowledges its agenda regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, because news articles are sometimes infused with opinion, and some articles distort facts to advance the writer’s point of view, NewsGuard has determined that MiddleEastMonitor.com does not meet the standard for responsibly handling the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<p>In 2011, Dave Rich, deputy communications director of the Community Security Trust, a nonprofit that fights anti-semitism in the UK, said that Middle East Monitor promotes “conspiracy theories about politicians in Western nations being beholden to Jewish or Zionist political manipulation and financial inducements, along with other classical antisemitic canards and tropes.” </p>\n<p>In 2014, for example, the site published an article stating that then-President Barack Obama’s policies toward Israel were being dictated by \"Zionist votes and Zionist money” -- terminology many see as a coded slur against Jews. </p>\n<p>In 2013, Rich raised concerns about a September 2012 MiddleEastMonitor.com opinion article that argued that the film “Innocence of Muslims” -- a hoax anti-Islam YouTube movie designed to inflame Middle East public opinion -- was part of a “calculated Zionist crusade.” Although the film’s producer, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, originally falsely claimed he was an Israeli Jew bankrolled by “100 Jewish donors,” Rich noted that MiddleEastMonitor.com posted the “Zionist crusade” article seven days after<em> </em>that story was debunked and Nakoula’s true identity as an Egyptian Christian was revealed.</p>\n<p>The MiddleEastMonitor.com link Rich provided as evidence of his claim has been removed. However, NewsGuard found the article in question elsewhere on the site, dated January 2014 -- 17 months after Nakoula was exposed. The article still contains the “Zionist crusade” language, and states that “It wouldn’t be surprising if it emerges that producer… Nakoula is only a front for a pro-Israeli US group.” There is no evidence for this insinuation.</p>\n<p>Because MiddleEastMonitor.com has published numerous articles that promote conspiracy theories about Jewish influence and has not taken down articles shown to be misleading or false, such as the post about “Innocence of Muslims,” NewsGuard has determined that it does not meet the standard for gathering and reporting news responsibly and that it repeatedly publishes false content.</p>\n<p>Many articles on MiddleEastMonitor.com include a hyperlink that says “Spotted an error on this page? Let us know.” When clicked, this opens a form readers can use to submit concerns or questions. The site has issued corrections in the past, in the form of notes appended to the bottom of articles detailing how and when they were updated to rectify errors. However, it has never corrected the false stories published above.</p>\n<p>The site did not respond to six NewsGuard messages asking about its editorial standards, including how it handles the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Many stories on the site name the writer, and bylines are often linked to contributor pages that contain biographical details. The About Us page includes names and email addresses for site leaders and staff writers as well as the names of regular contributors and six “honorary advisers.”</p>\n<p>The site’s Contact Us page offers an electronic comment box that can be used to reach the site; the message will be forwarded to “the relevant person” on the staff, the site says. The About Us page does not provide details of the site’s non-profit status or financing.</p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<p>The site did not respond to six NewsGuard messages asking about its lack of disclosure about its ownership and financing.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Middle East Monitor was founded in 2009, it said, to “master the art of information gathering, analysis and dissemination” through “well organised, focused and targeted operations.” It is the host organization for the Palestine Book Awards, and launched digital and print publication arm MEMO Publishers in 2012.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJon Allsop\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
