Drudge Report is one of the first successful independent news sites and one of the most trafficked U.S. news sites.

Drudge is not identified on the site as the owner, although the site’s URL and the “Drudge Report” trademark are both registered under his name. </p>\n<p>Drudge Report runs ads, which advertisers purchase through an online ad management company called Intermarkets Inc.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Drudge Report’s design has changed little since Drudge turned his email newsletter into a website in 1997. Editorial content consists of photos and headlines that are hyperlinked to news stories from traditional news outlets, such as The New York Times, the Washington Post, and The Associated Press, as well as blogs and fringe sites, such as InfoWars.com and Russian propaganda site RT.com. The Guardian noted in 2018 that “it is amazing that the Drudge Report continues to enjoy the influence it does…. The layout of the site is virtually unchanged from the original design, as though it were stuck in time.”</p>\n<p>For its many followers, the Drudge Report provides a convenient way to become aware of the news of the moment. The site’s main focus is U.S. politics, but it also features stories about world affairs, entertainment, business, sports, and weather. (Matt Drudge has long seemed fascinated by major weather events). Links are presented as headlines, which are written by Drudge Report’s editorial staff, and often<strong> </strong>differ from the headlines that appear on the linked articles. Links are added and removed from the homepage -- which is nearly the entirety of the site -- throughout the day. A link to the Drudge Report archives allows visitors to search for past stories and photos featured on the site, as well as to the homepage on specific dates.</p>\n<p>The site features one banner headline near the top of the homepage, accompanied by an unattributed photo. The banner headline is written in a larger font than other headlines, and usually appears in all caps. For example, in September 2018, some of the site’s leading headlines included “CHAOS AT KAVANAUGH,” referring to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings; “HURRICANE WARNING GULF,” which linked to a weather report about hurricane warnings in the Gulf Coast; and “BETO HAS A DREAM,” which linked to an Associated Press story about Texas Democratic Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke.  </p>\n<p>Above the site’s banner headline are a series of smaller headlines, usually related to a single major news story. For example, at one point on September 4, 2018, Drudge ran eight links to stories about journalist Bob Woodward’s book on President Donald Trump’s White House. The next day, the site ran four linked headlines about a passenger plane quarantined at New York City’s JFK airport. </p>\n<p>Below the banner headline, there are three columns of links aggregated from across the internet. The links are presented as headlines with a few variations in presentation: Colors of the links are either black or red, and some are in all caps while others are italicized. Almost all of them end in an ellipsis.</p>\n<p>Below the day’s links, Drudge Report features dozens of links to the homepages of various news outlets, ranging in orientation and credibility from mainstream news outlets, such as ABC News and USA Today, to more fringe sites, such as Zero Hedge and Infowars. The site also maintains a list of links to the work of individual columnists and commentators, as well as to box office results and TV ratings. Drudge Report posts its internal traffic numbers near the bottom of the site. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>For two decades, Matt Drudge has been one of the most influential forces in news, and in conservative media in particular. When Drudge Report links to a story, it sends large amounts of traffic to the story’s website, giving Drudge outsized power to shape political narratives, promote certain stories, and advance the financial fortunes of favored sites. In 2006, veteran political reporters Mark Halperin and John F. Harris wrote in their book “The Way to Win” that Drudge “is the gatekeeper...he is the Walter Cronkite of his era.” A 2011 study found that Drudge Report drove more traffic to news sites than Facebook or Twitter at that time. In July 2016, as the presidential campaign entered its final phase, Drudge Report was the second most visited news site in the U.S., after MSN.com, according to market intelligence firm SimilarWeb. The firm also found that in the first half of 2018, Drudge’s website received more traffic than The New York Times or The Washington Post. </p>\n<p>The site’s headlines typically provide an accurate depiction of the linked story, but are usually shorter and more attention-grabbing than the story’s original headline. For example, on September 6, 2018, a New York Times story about the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh ran with the headline “Leaked Kavanaugh Documents Discuss Abortion and Affirmative Action.” Drudge Report linked to the story with the headline, written in red font, “Roe v. Wade NOT settled law?” </p>\n<p>For a story about an African-American sniper killing five police officers in Dallas in 2016, the Drudge Report linked to a<strong> </strong>local NBC news report headlined “Sniper Ambush Kills 5 Officers, Injures 7 in Dallas Following Peaceful Protest.” The Drudge headline -- “BLACK LIVES KILL,” a play on the Black Lives Matter movement -- was condemned by both liberals and conservatives.</p>\n<p>Drudge Report produces little original editorial content apart from the linked headlines that cover the site’s homepage. It has occasionally published important scoops, one of which rattled U.S. politics and marked Drudge’s emergence as a powerful political force: In 1998, Drudge reported that Newsweek was sitting on a story about President Bill Clinton having an affair with an unnamed intern. The next day, Drudge reported that the intern’s name was Monica Lewinsky. The revelations resulted in the the world’s media sharing Drudge’s scoop and would eventually result in the House of Representatives voting to impeach Clinton on charges of lying under oath and obstructing justice in connection with efforts to cover up the affair.</p>\n<p>Drudge Report has broken other news, particularly about American media. It was the first to report that Fox News CEO and Chairman Roger Ailes left the network after sexual harassment allegations in 2016, and was the first to report Ailes’s death in 2017. It was also the first to report that conservative pundit Tucker Carlson would replace Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly in 2017. </p>\n<p>Drudge Report does not appear to run corrections, and the site does not include a corrections policy. On September 17, 2018, the site linked to a story from the site news.grabien.com that said the woman who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in high school, Christine Ford, received “savage” reviews from students at the university where she taught. Drudge ran the story with the headline “CHRISTINE FORD’S STUDENTS SAVAGE HER IN REVIEWS.” The Drudge Report Twitter account tweeted out the story along with Drudge’s headline. </p>\n<p>But the story was quickly shown to be false: The reviews were for a Christine A. Ford, who teaches at California State University, Fullerton, and not Kavanaugh’s accuser, Christine B. Ford, who teaches at Palo Alto University. Grabien, the site that published the story, retracted the story and ran an editor’s note at the top of the story’s webpage, but Drudge Report simply removed the story from its homepage, without issuing any correction. The Drudge Report also deleted its tweet promoting the story.  </p>\n<p>Drudge Report did not respond to an email asking about its handling of the Christine Ford matter and two emails about its approach to corrections. </p>\n<p>The site occasionally pairs photos and articles in a misleading manner. In June 2018, for example, the site ran the headline “BORDER BATTLE: USA TAKING IN 250 KIDS PER DAY” that linked to a Washington Examiner story about the Trump administration’s detainment of undocumented immigrant children. But the photo that ran with the headline was not a picture of children at the border, but instead was an uncredited, uncaptioned 2012 picture of Syrian children smiling and holding toy guns, which appeared to be genuine firearms. Christiaan Triebert, the photographer who took the photo, told Vox.com that Drudge Report’s use of the photo was an “obscene misrepresentation of what the photo actually depicts.” </p>\n<p>Matt Drudge has advanced conspiracy theories, both on his site and in other public forums. </p>\n<p>Starting in 2010, when Drudge began linking to InfoWars.com, Drudge has driven traffic and attention to InfoWars, a notorious purveyor of misinformation and outlandish conspiracy theories. In 2011, Alex Jones, who runs InfoWars, said in an interview with New York magazine: “If you had to say there was one source who really helped us break out, who took our information, helped to punch it out to an even more effective level, [Drudge is] the guy.” In 2013, an analysis by liberal group Media Matters found that Drudge linked to InfoWars articles 244 times between April 2011 and April 2013. </p>\n<p>On November 4, 2016, just days before the presidential election, Drudge featured an InfoWars story as his banner headline, which read “WIKI WICCAN: PODESTA PRACTICES OCCULT MAGIC.” The story, which ran on InfoWars.com with the headline “‘SPIRIT COOKING’: CLINTON CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN PRACTICES BIZARRE OCCULT RITUAL” was about an invitation to a “Spirit Cooking dinner” forwarded to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta from performance artist Marina Abramović. The invitation was part of the trove of Podesta’s hacked emails that WikiLeaks published during the final months of the 2016 campaign.</p>\n<p>The InfoWars story linked the term “Spirit Cooking” to “an occult performance during which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are used to create a ‘painting.” The story went on to connect Podesta’s supposed interest in “weird, gory occult ceremonies,” to the debunked conspiracy theory, known as “Pizzagate,” which held that other Podesta emails used the code word “pizza” to refer to sexually trafficked children. The story did not mention that another email in the published trove seemed to indicate Podesta did not attend the dinner.</p>\n<p>On November 6, 2016, two days before election day, Drudge Report ran a link at the top of its homepage that read “SHOCK: Obama Encourages Illegals to Vote...Promises No Repercussions...’” The link led to a story on TheGatewayPundit.com with the headline “Criminal President Obama Encourages Illegal Aliens to Vote - Promises No Repercussions (VIDEO).” The story was about a video clip of an interview Obama gave to actress Gina Rodriguez. In the clip, Obama seemed to be endorsing the idea that undocumented immigrants should vote in the presidential election. The next day, Drudge linked to a similar article from WND.com in his banner headline, which read “OBAMA ‘ENCOURAGES ILLEGALS TO VOTE.’” </p>\n<p>But the full video of the interview shows that Obama was answering a confusingly worded question by encouraging Latino citizens to vote, assuring them that voting would not bring law enforcement scrutiny to their households if they lived with undocumented family members.</p>\n<p>In addition to InfoWars, Drudge also regularly links to Russian propaganda sites RT.com and SputnikNews.com. A November 2017 Washington Post analysis found that over the course of the 2016 campaign, Drudge was “not shy about linking directly to individual stories at Infowars, as well as RT and Sputnik News, both content-sharing arms of the Russian government.” The analysis found that “on more than a third of the days between when Donald Trump announced his candidacy and when he won the presidency, the Drudge Report had a link from Infowars, RT or Sputnik on its homepage by 9 a.m.”</p>\n<p>In response to the Washington Post analysis, Drudge tweeted: \"I've linked to @washingtonpost over 10,000X in 25 years of doing DRUDGEREPORT. I currently give them 37% of their referral traffic, according to similarweb.com. It's a brutal business. Not even a thank you. Instead: YOU'RE A RUSSIAN OPERATIVE!\"</p>\n<p>Drudge’s point about his links to reliable sites such as the Washington Post raises this dilemma for NewsGuard: If the content that an aggregation site chooses is mostly reliable but the site also links to high-impact false content, does it publish “responsibly?” Our judgment is that it does not.</p>\n<p>Because of Drudge Report’s failure to properly vet stories and its reliance on untrustworthy sites with a history of spreading outlandish conspiracy theories, including InfoWars.com, NewsGuard has determined the site does not gather and present information responsibly. Drudge’s enormous influence exacerbates these issues, as a single link from Drudge can push a fringe conspiracy theory into the mainstream. Publishing responsibly also involves considering the consequences of what is published. Drudge Report did not respond to two emails seeking comment about this determination. </p>\n<p>The site also regularly features links to weather reports of unseasonably cold temperatures, which some critics have ascribed to Drudge’s desire to deny climate change. In 2009, Jesse Zwick wrote in The New Republic that “the far left has been guilty of spinning every scorcher of a day or coastal hurricane into a sign that a climate crisis is already upon us, but Drudge has taken this approach to a whole new level. Screw data analysis—Drudge’s snowstorm media blitzkrieg is the equivalent of death by anecdote.”</p>\n<p>In October 2016, Drudge implied in a pair of tweets that Hurricane Matthew was a hoax to scare people into believing in climate change. “Hurricane Center has monopoly on data. No way of verifying claims. Nassau ground observations DID NOT match statements! 165mph gusts? WHERE?” Drudge tweeted. Matthew claimed 1,000 lives in Haiti and another 46 lives in the U.S., according to The Associated Press.</p>\n<p>In October 2015, Drudge, who rarely grants interviews, appeared on the InfoWars radio show hosted by Jones. In the interview, Drudge made bizarre and baseless claims, including that there are 80 million “illegals” living in the U.S., that the Obama administration came up with the name “ISIS” for the deadly terror group because it sounded like the last name of Republican Congressman Darrell Issa, and that coverage of Hillary Clinton’s supposed “lovers” was being suppressed. </p>\n<p>Drudge, a self-described conservative, does not typically endorse candidates, but he has been accused of using his website to support or attack individual candidates. During the presidential primary campaign in April 2016, Texas senator and then presidential candidate Ted Cruz told a conservative radio host that the Drudge Report had become “the attack site for the Donald Trump campaign.” In response, political news site Politico analyzed Drudge Report’s banner headlines in 2016 and found Cruz had “a strong argument.” According to Politico, Drudge Report “largely pushed banner pieces publicizing Trump favorably and in recent days either criticizing or deriding Cruz, a stark shift from 2015, when he appeared to be ambivalent toward the billionaire businessman.”</p>\n<p>Since Trump took office, press reports have indicated Drudge has enjoyed access to the administration. Drudge has been in the White House “all the time,” a senior administration official told<strong> </strong>CNNMoney in July 2017. CNNMoney, citing an unnamed source, reported that Drudge regularly gave advice to Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, during the 2016 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>Drudge Report, however, has linked to stories critical of the president. In July 2018, after the Helsinki, Finland, summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, Drudge ran the banner headline “PUTIN DOMINATES IN HEL,” which linked to a Daily Mail story about the summit. On August 21, 2018, the day Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen, pled guilty to campaign finance charges and Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was convicted of numerous financial crimes, Drudge ran three simultaneous banner headlines in all capital letters and red font: “TRUMP HELL DAY,” “MANAFORT: GUILTY,” and “COHEN: I’M GUILTY.”</p>\n<p>Drudge Report does not disclose anywhere on the site that it has a political or ideological orientation. Drudge Report does link to news from across the political spectrum (although not typically the far-left). Nonetheless, its overall habit of pushing stories and narratives that support particular candidates and cast Democrats and liberals in a negative light, coupled with the site’s lack of disclosure about its conservative bent, has led NewsGuard to determine the Drudge Report does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. Drudge Report did not respond to two emails seeking comment about this determination. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Drudge Report does not list its editorial staff who curate the stories that appear on the site. It also does not provide any information about Drudge himself, or identify him as its publisher, outside of its name. It does provide a general email address, Drudge@drudgereport.com, to contact the site. </p>\n<p>Although Matt Drudge is widely known in media and political circles as the owner and publisher of Drudge Report, there is no mention of Matt Drudge on the site, and no way for visitors without prior knowledge of Drudge to know who owns or runs the site. Moreover, for people unfamiliar with Matt Drudge, the name “Drudge Report” does not necessarily even indicate involvement by a person named “Drudge;” a visitor could believe the word “drudge” is a verb, as in “drudging up news.” For these reasons, NewsGuard has concluded that Drudge Report does not disclose its ownership or who is in charge. </p>\n<p>Advertising is clearly distinguished from news content.</p>\n<p>Drudge Report did not respond to two emails inquiring about the site’s lack of disclosure about site owners, leader, and content creators.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Matt Drudge launched Drudge Report as an email newsletter in 1994 while working at a gift shop at CBS studios in Los Angeles. After building a considerable following, Drudge transitioned his operation to the website DrudgeReport.com in 1997.</p>\n<p>The late conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart, who founded the popular site that bears his name, got his start working as Drudge’s first assistant.  </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJosh Keefe\n\nEdited by:\nEric Effron&#x26;emsp;Kendrick
