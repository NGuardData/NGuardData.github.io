The company was founded by Joel Babbit, an advertising and public relations executive, and Chuck Leavell, the longtime keyboardist for the Rolling Stones and The Allman Brothers Band who is also a tree farmer and environmental activist. Narrative Content Group reports on its website that CNN and Discovery Communications are among its equity partners.</p>\n<p>MNN is financed through a sponsorship model in which companies pay an annual fee (USA Today reported it was $300,000 in 2012) to become sponsors. In return, MNN collaborates with the sponsor to create sponsored content, including videos and articles, which are featured prominently on its site next to news articles. The sponsored content is clearly identified by labels and a page design distinct from MNN news items.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Mother Nature Network describes itself on an about page as a source for “news and information related to the environment and responsible living.” Its coverage is divided into sections including Earth Matters, Health, Lifestyle, Tech, Money, Home, and Family.</p>\n<p>Many articles are presented in list form, highlighting interesting facts about science, the environment, and health. Although the site includes some breaking news, most articles are not time-sensitive.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>While Mother Nature Network does not feature a significant amount of original reporting, its writers reference trustworthy secondary sources and provide readers with a variety of perspectives. Articles frequently provide multiple links to outside news sources, environmentalist groups, government agencies, academic studies, and other sources. Headlines are accurate and do not sensationalize or misrepresent facts presented in articles.</p>\n<p>Some articles on the site, particularly in the Politics section, are written as commentary or analysis and express opinions. While these articles reference trustworthy sources and do not distort information, they are not distinguished from straightforward news articles. In a story titled “It's time to stop listening to your elders,” for example, the writer voices support for the political activism of younger Americans following a mass murder at a high school in Parkland, Florida.</p>\n<p>Although opinion and advocacy pieces are limited on the site, the About page of Mother Nature Network states that its content is “non-political.” Because of this mixed messaging and the lack of clear labeling, NewsGuard has found that the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>In an email to NewsGuard, Managing Editor Sarah Hicks said that MNN “allow[s] some trusted bloggers to occasionally veer into opinion territory, but we do want the reader to know which is which.” She said that in the past, such stories included a note to readers signalling that they included the writer’s views, adding that she planned to reinstate the use of that note. NewsGuard will reevaluate its evaluation of the site when appropriate.</p>\n<p>When the site learns of an error, it updates the article with the correct information and notes that the article was updated. Hicks told NewsGuard that for significant errors, an “editor’s note” describes what was fixed. “Corrections are handled as they come in, and quickly. The updates are made in the article itself so a first-time reader will get the most up-to-date information,” Hicks said. “If a correction merits a specific explanation, we'll put an editor's note in the middle of the file where the error occurred to make it clear what happened and why there was an issue.”</p>\n<p>NewsGuard found several examples of stories on the site that were re-published with editor’s notes indicating that they included corrected information.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site includes pages with biographical information about its board of directors, advisory board, and editorial staff, including newsroom leaders and content creators. Articles include the name of the writer, with a link to biographical information.</p>\n<p>Mnn.com distinguishes sponsored content from editorial content. Paid content is labeled at the top “Sponsored by,” along with the name of the advertiser. When users click on the headline to access the article, the article page is also labeled “Sponsored Content.”</p>\n<p>The site discloses its corporate ownership.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Joel Babbit and Chuck Leavell founded Mother Nature Network in 2009.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJack Craver\n\nEdited by:\nKendrick McDonald&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mnn.com/about-us\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mnn.com/about-us</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.narrativecontentgroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.narrativecontentgroup.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/11/14/mother-nature-network-treehugger/1705447/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/11/14/mother-nature-network-treehugger/1705447/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://adage.com/article/digital/mother-nature-network-attracts-coca-cola-aflac-t/147213/\" target=\"_blank\">http://adage.com/article/digital/mother-nature-network-attracts-coca-cola-aflac-t/147213/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.narrativecontentgroup.com/about-us.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.narrativecontentgroup.com/about-us.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/eco-tourism/sponsorstory/the-sobering-facts-about-distracted-driving\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/eco-tourism/sponsorstory/the-sobering-facts-about-distracted-driving</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/sponsorvideo/breakfast-crew-filling-need-and-filling-stomachs\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/sponsorvideo/breakfast-crew-filling-need-and-filling-stomachs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/climate-weather/blogs/historic-forecast-issued-october-alaska\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/climate-weather/blogs/historic-forecast-issued-october-alaska</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/politics\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/politics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/politics/blogs/we-will-outlive-you\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/politics/blogs/we-will-outlive-you</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/politics/blogs/nostalgia-stealing-our-kids-future\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/politics/blogs/nostalgia-stealing-our-kids-future</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mnn.com/meet-the-mnn-team\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mnn.com/meet-the-mnn-team</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mnn.com/advisory-board\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mnn.com/advisory-board</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mnn.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mnn.com/contact</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"mnn.com","author":"Jack Craver","date":"2018-10-09T18:43:57.192+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/mnn.com/"}}
