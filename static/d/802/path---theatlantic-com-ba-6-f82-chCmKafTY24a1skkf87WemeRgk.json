In July 2017, the Emerson Collective LLC, a private company based in Palo Alto, California, and founded by businesswoman and philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs (the widow of Apple Inc. founder Steve Jobs), acquired a majority stake in The Atlantic.</p>\n<p>The Emerson Collective’s work centers on “education, immigration reform, the environment, health, and other social justice initiatives,” according to its mission statement.</p>\n<p>David G. Bradley, the chairman of The Atlantic, acquired the magazine in 1999 and transformed it into a digital brand while maintaining the print publication. Bradley will retain a minority stake for up to five years, after which Emerson Collective has the option to acquire full control.</p>\n<p>The Atlantic draws revenue from print and digital advertisements and subscriptions, as well as through live events, media consulting services, a video channel on YouTube, and a reader membership service “The Masthead,” which offers members access to exclusive stories, an insider view to how some stories are put together, a subscription to the magazine, and access to live events, among other perks.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>In a note to readers from 2015, then-editor of TheAtlantic.com J.J. Gould wrote that the site is in part the website of a magazine, in part a news site, and also a blog, describing the site’s ambition to be “a direct, dynamic, digital extension of our core identity in journalism—as a <em>real-time magazine.</em>” The homepage either emphasizes the “urgency of our news coverage or the impact of a big feature, according to the needs of the moment,” Gould added. </p>\n<p>TheAtlantic.com publishes stories on politics, culture, science, technology, business, health, and family. Some articles offer social and cultural commentary while others report news, at times with a point of view, which in the past two years has often been anti-Trump. The Atlantic has endorsed a candidate in a national presidential election three times in its history: Abraham Lincoln in 1860 (a rebuke of slavery), Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 (a rebuke of Johnson’s conservative Republican opponent Barry Goldwater), and Hillary Clinton in 2016 (a rebuke of Donald Trump).</p>\n<p>The Atlantic is best known for its longform narrative and investigative stories and essays from its magazine, which not only attract a large digital audience, but also can shape cultural conversations. Some notable examples include a cover story by Alex Tizon, “My Family’s Slave,” about the woman who had raised him, (which was also the best read digital story of any publication in 2017 as measured by how much time readers spent engaged with it, according to analytics service Chartbeat); Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “The Case for Reparations” in which Coates argued for Americans to reckon with the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow; and Anne-Marie Slaughter’s “Why Women Still Can’t Have It All,” which reinvigorated the conversation about balancing work and motherhood. </p>\n<p>Archived issues of the magazine are available through the “Magazine” section of the site. Articles that appear in the print magazine are distinguished from those that appear solely in digital form by noting which issue the article was printed in next to the writer’s name. (The digital archive is essentially complete through 1995, while issues dating to the magazine’s 1857 founding have been digitized in part.)</p>\n<p>TheAtlantic.com publishes a series of email newsletters including daily, weekly, and monthly editions. An in-house production studio creates videos for the site including short animated videos, documentaries, and web series. The site also produces audio content in a number of formats including, podcasts, and written feature stories read aloud.</p>\n<p>The site features a selection of editorially curated reader feedback in its Letters section, including reactions to stories on Twitter and other social media platforms.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>In January 2018, senior editor and research chief Yvonne Rolzhausen published a story “How to Fact Check The Atlantic,” in which she detailed the fact-checking that a story that runs in The Atlantic undergoes. “We think about a piece on a variety of levels: Are the basic facts correct? Are the facts underlying various opinions correct?,” she wrote. “And, finally, do they all fit together into a comprehensive and solid argument? We go word by word, line by line. For an intensively-reported piece, I might have dozens of sources to contact and hundreds of questions for an author.”  </p>\n<p><br> “Before a magazine piece gets to the copy desk, it has gone through days or weeks or months of trimming, expanding, and rewriting with its main editor. It has ideally also been read by one or more of the magazine’s top editors to address any glaring holes. Our concern is thus: Would you, the reader, be able to pick up a copy of the magazine, open to the first page of a given article, and, without any prior knowledge or extra information, be able to understand what we mean to get across?”  </p>\n<p>The Atlantic regularly corrects errors published in its content, including in its newsletters, noting the error and the change in italics. Readers can suggest corrections through the contact page by selecting “Typos or Corrections” from a dropdown list and filling out the form.</p>\n<p>The Atlantic has won 24 National Magazine Awards, the highest honor bestowed on American magazine journalism, most recently in 2018 for Tizon’s cover story. The Atlantic also won the award for “Magazine of the Year” in 2016 and best magazine website in 2013.</p>\n<p>TheAtlantic.com has won two Webby Awards given by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences in recognition of the best work on the internet -- in 2014 for the best political blog and in 2009 for the best digital magazine.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The Atlantic is unusually transparent about its editorial processes, publishing articles like those mentioned above. In addition to narrating their work, the editors provide images of their annotated drafts, thus letting readers see how the proverbial sausage is made.</p>\n<p>The Atlantic names all staff members and top executives, usually with links to short biographies, and social media profiles. On its Writers page, The Atlantic provides an alphabetical directory of editors and staff writers, with photographs and links to their social media profiles, biographies, and story archives. Bylines in stories also lead to these author pages.</p>\n<p>On its Contact Us page theatlantic.com lists a phone number as well as email addresses and contact forms through which readers can contact the publication. On a separate Send a News Tip page, the site lists a mailing address and a variety of means through which people can send information. In February 2018, TheAtlantic.com shut down the comments section and instead includes a line at the bottom of every article inviting readers to submit letters through a linked form or by email, a selection of which are published in a Letters section.</p>\n<p>On July 28, 2017, theatlantic.com published an in-depth story on the acquisition of the publication by the Emerson Collective, which included details about the organization’s investments and about the ownership of The Atlantic. That article, however, is not easily accessible on the site.</p>\n<p>The site’s Terms and Conditions page names only The Atlantic Monthly Group LLC as the owner of The Atlantic, without disclosing the stake that the Emerson Collective and Chairman David Bradley have in the company. A spokesperson said the site is in the process of updating its “FAQ” section (frequently asked questions) and would include more information about ownership.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Atlantic counts among its founders giants of American literature including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Herman Melville, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Harriet Beecher Stowe, and had strong ties to the abolitionist movement and Transcendental philosophy. In its first issue, in 1857, it published its mission:</p>\n<p>“In politics, The <em>Atlantic Monthly </em>will be the organ of no party or clique, but will honestly endeavor to be the exponent of what its conductors believe to be the American idea. It will deal frankly with persons and with parties, endeavoring always to keep in view that moral element which transcends all persons and parties, and which alone makes the basis of a true and lasting prosperity. It will not rank itself with any sect of anties: but with that body of men which is in favor of Freedom, National Progress, and Honor, whether public or private.”</p>\n<p>Over its 160 year history, the magazine has published some of the most influential American writers and thinkers, including Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, Ernest Hemingway, and Martin Luther King, Jr.  </p>\n<p>Through the first decade of the 2000s, The Atlantic transformed itself from a print literary publication to a multi-platform digital publisher covering news, politics, and culture. In 2003, The Atlantic Monthly cut back publication of the print magazine to ten issues a year, and shortly thereafter, it officially renamed itself The Atlantic. In 2005, The Atlantic stopped publishing fiction in every issue in order to devote more space to “long-form narrative reporting,” according to a letter by the editors published in the May issue of that year. That same year, The Atlantic’s chairman, David Bradley, announced the publication would move to Washington from its home in Boston in an effort to centralize editorial operations and to expand the magazine’s scale.</p>\n<p><em>Corrections: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label incorrectly described the Emerson Collective as a nonprofit. Also, the label gave an incorrect date for the magazine’s founding; It was 1857. Finally, the name of the magazine’s senior editor and research chief was misspelled; the correct spelling is Yvonne Rolzhausen.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nYemile Bucay\n\nEdited
