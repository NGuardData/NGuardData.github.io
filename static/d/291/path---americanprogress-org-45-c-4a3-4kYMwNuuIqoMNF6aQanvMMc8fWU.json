The organization recorded more than $51 million in revenue in 2017, according to its most recent Internal Revenue Service filings. Nearly all of its revenue came from contributions and grants.</p>\n<p>The organization’s biggest donors in 2017 included major funders of liberal causes such as the Democracy Forward Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and George Soros’ Open Society Foundations. The group also received contributions from corporations including Apple, Walmart, and Google.</p>\n<p>ThinkProgress.org, a liberal news site, is funded by the Center for American Progress Action Fund, the group’s lobbying arm.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>An About page on AmericanProgress.org says that the Center for American Progress “is dedicated to improving the lives of all Americans, through bold, progressive ideas, as well as strong leadership and concerted action.” The organization also states that its “aim is not just to change the conversation, but to change the country.”</p>\n<p>AmericanProgress.org publishes briefs, columns, and reports on nearly 20 U.S. and world issues, including the economy, energy, education, healthcare, immigration, poverty, LGBTQ and women's rights, and criminal justice. The site’s content is written from a liberal perspective and supports initiatives that align with these views.</p>\n<p>An October 2018 report, for example, uses data compiled by the Center for American Progress to argue for the expansion of Medicaid. In a September 2018 brief, the site details how ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program would hurt undocumented immigrants in the U.S. and argues that states should help protect DACA recipients.</p>\n<p>Content is produced by policy analysts, academic fellows, and senior staff members. About one-third of the Center for American Progress’ staff was part of the Obama administration, according to a July 2016 article in The New York Times.</p>\n<p>AmericanProgress.org maintains a database of its policy experts, analysts, and seniors fellows, sorted by name and specialization. The Center for American Progress also produces a weekly podcast, called “Thinking Cap,” which the site says “covers the major issues at the intersection of activism, race, policy, and politics.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Center for American Progress is known as a highly influential Democratic think tank. In its 2017 rankings, the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program at the University of Pennsylvania rated the group as the seventh most influential think tank in the U.S. and 12th globally. Mainstream media outlets, such as Reuters, The Washington Post, and U.S. News &#x26; World Report, regularly cite content produced by the Center and publish op-eds written by its staff.</p>\n<p>Content published by AmericanProgress.org is generally fact-based, often citing government agencies, academic research, reputable media outlets, and other credible sources. Reports and issue briefs often list their sources and include extensive information about methodology. Headlines and images accurately reflect the content.</p>\n<p>On its About page, the Center calls itself “an independent nonpartisan policy institute” that “does not support or oppose candidates or political parties.” The About page also describes the group’s liberal perspective. “As progressives, we believe America should be a land of boundless opportunity, where people can climb the ladder of economic mobility,” the page states. In 2016, Center for American Progress President and CEO Neera Tanden, a former top aide to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, told Politico that the organization aimed to be “the central hub of the Trump resistance.”</p>\n<p>NewsGuard did not find instances of misstated, distorted, or cherry-picked facts used to advance the Center for American Progress’ agenda. For this reason, and because the organization’s mission is clearly stated, NewsGuard has determined that the site handles the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>AmericanProgress.org publishes corrections, typically with a note at the top of the article that alerts readers to the correction, which is explained at the bottom of the content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Issue briefs, columns, and reports on AmericanProgress.org name the author and link to a biography, which includes an archive of his or her work. Center for American Progress staff members, including senior leadership, are listed on a Staff page, along with biographies. The names of the organization’s board of directors and trustee advisory board are listed on dedicated pages.</p>\n<p>Individual contact information for Center for American Progress staff members is not provided, except for the organization’s media representatives. Readers can submit messages through general feedback forms on each staff member’s biography page.</p>\n<p>The Center for American Progress discloses all donors who have contributed $5,000 or more since 2014 on an Our Supporters page, including its largest funders — which it is not legally required. Some donors are listed only as “Anonymous,” although AmericanProgress.org says that corporate donors may not remain anonymous.  </p>\n<p>AmericanProgress.org does not run advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Center for American Progress was founded in 2003 by John Podesta, former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and former chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, and Sarah Rosen Wartell, a U.S. economy and housing markets expert. Podesta still serves on the organization’s board of directors. Rosen Wartell left in 2011 when she was named president of the Urban Institute, a social policy think tank in Washington.</p>\n<p>The group played a major role in the creation of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. According to a 2018 report published by the organization, it developed the law’s policy framework in 2005.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSophia Tewa\n\nEdited by:\nMelissa Goldin&#x26;emsp;Eric
