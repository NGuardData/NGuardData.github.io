Articles are not organized into categories. Instead, the top of the site links to Bipartisan Report’s Facebook and Twitter pages. Headlines and articles are opinionated and uniformly critical of President Trump, such as an April 2018 story titled “Trump Gets Smoked By Macron &#x26; Has 4 Tweet Wednesday Meltdown Like An Insecure Loser,” or a July 2018 piece headlined “Trump Just Said He’s More Popular Than Abraham Lincoln Like A Disrespectful Loser.”</p>\n<p>Articles are not based on original reporting. Instead, the site relies on tweets and reporting done by other news publications.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles link to tweets as well as to reporting in national and local news publications, such as the Washington Post and ABC News. However, Bipartisan Report regularly distorts the original content, sometimes using it as the basis for fabricated stories. A December 2016 article “Florida Moves For FULL RECOUNT Of State Over Massive Voter Fraud” cited an article by the Detroit Free Press about a lawsuit filed on behalf of three Florida voters alleging voter fraud. The original article did not state that Florida was moving towards a recount. Politifact, the fact-checking site, noted that after contacting Bipartisan Report, the article was removed from the site, which posted the the message: “Thanks for bringing that to our attention and it was removed it [sic] from our page as we try to make every story as accurate as possible.” </p>\n<p>A March 2017 article titled “JUST IN: All 8 Supreme Court Justices Stand In Solidarity Against Trump SCOTUS Pick” stated that the Supreme Court had written a “letter” unanimously “rejecting” Neil Gorsuch, President Trump’s nominee. The article cited as its source a Supreme Court opinion from March 2017 disagreeing with an appellate decision that cited a Gorsuch case as precedent. Bipartisan Report heavily distorted the truth by describing the Supreme Court’s decision as a “letter” citing “a 2008 ruling by Gorsuch as reason” that “President Trump is completely wrong in choosing Neil Gorsuch.” Bipartisan Report’s articles have been regularly declared false by numerous fact-checking organizations and news publications, including Snopes, Politifact, ABC News, and AOL News. An independent NewsGuard review confirmed these findings.</p>\n<p>The site’s ostensible news articles are highly opinionated, using sensationalized wording with a liberal slant. For example, a July 2018 article -- “Fox News Does The Unthinkable &#x26; Fact Checks Trump On NATO Lies LIVE In Front Of America” -- begins by stating, “Conservatives have never been accused of being smart.” Later, the article asks, in reference to a Trump supporter, “How do people like her ever get through a day without harming themselves on sharp objects?” Another July 2018 news article, “Scottish Newspaper Calls Trump ‘Racist, Serial Liar, Sex Abuser’ Ahead Of Visit; Donald Freaks,” states, “To the people of England, Scotland, the entire EU, and all other countries shaking their head in disappointment over the racist, misogynist, lying president of the United States, we’re sorry. We don’t like him, either.”</p>\n<p>The site does not state a corrections policy or regularly run corrections.</p>\n<p>Bipartisan Report did not respond to four NewsGuard emails asking about its false news stories, its use of sensationalized and opinionated wording, its lack of transparency about its ownership and content creators, and its corrections policy.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The Contact Us page lists one general email address, as well as the names and email addresses of its writers and editors, and the site’s managing editor. The site does not disclose its ownership or financing.</p>\n<p>Advertising is clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Bipartisanreport.com was founded in 2012 by Justin Brotman, who runs the site out of Seattle. According to a November 2016 article in the Seattle Times, Brotman chose the name of the site as “a middle finger to Fox News” for its claim about being “fair and balanced.” </p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this label incorrectly stated that Neil Gorsuch was one of several judges who issued an appellate decision overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. The language is updated to reflect that he did not rule on that case, but one of his earlier decisions was cited by the appellate court as precedent</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling\n\nEdited by:\nSarah Brandt&#x26;emsp;Joyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattles-own-click-bait-news-site-serves-up-red-meat-for-liberals/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattles-own-click-bait-news-site-serves-up-red-meat-for-liberals/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bipartisanreport.com/2018/04/25/trump-gets-smoked-by-macron-has-4-tweet-wednesday-meltdown-like-an-insecure-loser/\" target=\"_blank\">http://bipartisanreport.com/2018/04/25/trump-gets-smoked-by-macron-has-4-tweet-wednesday-meltdown-like-an-insecure-loser/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bipartisanreport.com/2018/07/12/trump-just-said-hes-more-popular-than-abraham-lincoln-like-a-disrespectful-loser/\" target=\"_blank\">http://bipartisanreport.com/2018/07/12/trump-just-said-hes-more-popular-than-abraham-lincoln-like-a-disrespectful-loser/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/news/ap-fact-check-florida-not-recounting-election-votes/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattletimes.com/news/ap-fact-check-florida-not-recounting-election-votes/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/bipartisan_report_scotus_neil_gorsuch.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/bipartisan<em>report</em>scotus<em>neil</em>gorsuch.pdf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-827_0pm1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-827_0pm1.pdf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/15/bipartisan-report/florida-calls-recount-over-voter-fraud-website-say/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/15/bipartisan-report/florida-calls-recount-over-voter-fraud-website-say/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bipartisanreport.com/2018/07/11/fox-news-does-the-unthinkable-fact-checks-trump-on-nato-lies-live-in-front-of-america/\" target=\"_blank\">http://bipartisanreport.com/2018/07/11/fox-news-does-the-unthinkable-fact-checks-trump-on-nato-lies-live-in-front-of-america/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bipartisanreport.com/2018/07/13/scottish-newspaper-calls-trump-racist-serial-liar-sex-abuser-ahead-of-visit-donald-freaks/\" target=\"_blank\">http://bipartisanreport.com/2018/07/13/scottish-newspaper-calls-trump-racist-serial-liar-sex-abuser-ahead-of-visit-donald-freaks/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/florida-seeking-full-recount-real-story/story?id=44224185\" target=\"_blank\">https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/florida-seeking-full-recount-real-story/story?id=44224185</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/donald-trump-time-magazine-man-year/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/donald-trump-time-magazine-man-year/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/03/29/fake-news-claims-entire-supreme-court-bench-opposes-neil-gorsuch/22017954/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/03/29/fake-news-claims-entire-supreme-court-bench-opposes-neil-gorsuch/22017954/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/facebook-clickbait-political-news-sites-us-election-trump\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/facebook-clickbait-political-news-sites-us-election-trump</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattles-own-click-bait-news-site-serves-up-red-meat-for-liberals/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattles-own-click-bait-news-site-serves-up-red-meat-for-liberals/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/facebook-clickbait-political-news-sites-us-election-trump\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/facebook-clickbait-political-news-sites-us-election-trump </a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"bipartisanreport.com","author":"Anna-Sophie Harling","date":"2018-08-29T16:52:12.895+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/bipartisanreport.com/"}}
