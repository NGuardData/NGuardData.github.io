Mikhail Solodovnikov, RT’s U.S. news director, is the corporation’s sole member and general manager. RT also publishes sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>RT uses the tagline “Question More,” which is consistent with the policies of the Russian government under President Vladimir Putin to raise doubts about other countries and their institutions. The website also states, “We are set to show you how any story can be another story altogether.” Coverage on RT.com focuses on U.S., U.K., and Russian politics, sports, and business news.</p>\n<p>The network broadcasts seven channels — RT (the flagship, English-language channel aired from Moscow), RT Arabic, RT en Español, RT America, RT UK, RT Documentary, and RT en Français. Users can watch most of these broadcasts live on RT.com, although RT Deutsch can only be viewed online. RT publishes content in six languages.</p>\n<p>RT produces special projects such as FakeCheck, an interactive tool that is designed to teach users to “separate fact from fake” and #1917LIVE, a month-by-month overview of the Russian Revolution.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>RT.com’s About Us section states that the website “covers stories overlooked by the mainstream media, provides alternative perspectives on current affairs, and acquaints international audiences with a Russian viewpoint on major global events.”</p>\n<p>However, RT.com’s news coverage regularly advances false claims and propaganda promoted by the Kremlin, and refutes facts that do not align with the Russian government, which owns and funds RT. While RT.com accurately quotes Russian officials in its reports, NewsGuard has determined that RT.com, as a government-run outlet publishing the government’s false claims, has repeatedly published false content.</p>\n<p>For example, in multiple articles, RT.com has advanced the Kremlin’s claim that the Russia-backed Syrian government did not use chemical weapons in April 2018 against its own citizens. Those claims have been contradicted for years by first-person accounts, photos, and videos documenting the victims, and reports from the United Nations and France.</p>\n<p>The RT stories advanced Russian government officials’ assertions that activists’ accounts of the chemical attacks were invented to provide a reason for the U.S. and foreign governments to attack Syria. An April 2018 article stated, “Russia insists the incident was staged and said it reserves the right to counter any attack on Syria.” A September 2018 article declared, “Moscow has repeatedly warned that a false flag chemical weapon attack was being prepared in Idlib [Syria], giving the US and its allies justification to attack Syrian government forces.”</p>\n<p>A U.N. commission report shared with The New York Times in 2018 detailed similar actions. And in 2018, France released a declassified report stating that it had assessed “with a high degree of confidence” that the April 2018 chemical attacks were carried out by the Syrian regime based on “testimonies, photos and videos that spontaneously appeared on specialized websites, in the press and on social media in the hours and days following the attack.”</p>\n<p>In a September 2018 email response to NewsGuard’s questions about how RT characterized the Syrian chemical attacks, RT spokesperson Blair Dunbar said, “The mainstream media has a tendency to jump to conclusions before receiving all the facts or having enough evidence to support their claims. … RT is committed to telling all sides of the story and examining the situation for ourselves, rather than just parroting other media’s talking points, and our reporting is facts-based.”</p>\n<p>Dunbar added that RT’s editing and fact-checking procedures adhere to “industry standards,” including the use of multiple sources and eyewitness accounts.</p>\n<p>Multiple RT videos and articles have advanced claims that Russia’s military agents were not responsible for the March 2018 poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Britain, claiming that it was part of a “false flag attack in Syria” orchestrated by the U.K. In January 2019, RT published an article titled, “Russian foreign intelligence chief accuses Britain of ‘destroying evidence’ in Skripal case,” which repeated the Russian official’s assertions that British authorities were provoking Russia by covering up “traces of the crime,” and hiding Skripal and his daughter from Russian authorities. </p>\n<p>In September 2018, the U.K. announced it was charging two men suspected of being Russian military agents with attempted murder in Skripal’s poisoning. British Prime Minister Theresa May said in a statement that “the two individuals named by the police and CPS are officers from the Russian military intelligence service.”</p>\n<p>In late 2018, U.K. media regulator Ofcom said RT had violated its impartiality rules, in part, for biased coverage of the Skripal poisoning. In response to Ofcom’s decision, an unnamed RT spokesperson said, “We operate under rules outlined by the regulator and always strive to abide by them,” according to a Reuters report. </p>\n<p>Before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, RT repeatedly published stories that criticized U.S. media coverage of Republican nominee Donald Trump and reported on hacked emails released by WikiLeaks about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and other prominent Democrats. Headlines of such stories published between August and early November 2016 included, “Julian Assange special: Do Wikileaks have the email that will put Hillary Clinton in prison?” “Calling Trump Moscow’s favorite is nonsense created by media – Putin,” “Assange: Clinton &#x26; ISIS funded by same money, Trump won’t be allowed to win,” and “The Great Debate,” which said, “The liberal corporate media have their candidate. Does Donald Trump still have a chance?”</p>\n<p>A 2017 U.S. intelligence report concluded that RT’s coverage advanced Russian government’s goals to influence the election, stating, “Russia’s state-run propaganda machine — comprised of its domestic media apparatus, outlets targeting global audiences such as RT and Sputnik, and a network of quasi-government trolls — contributed to the influence campaign by serving as a platform for Kremlin messaging to Russian and international audiences.”</p>\n<p>In a 2018 interview with CBS, RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan responded to the findings outlined in the U.S. intelligence report, saying, “There's nothing illegal that we did. There's nothing murky. There's no weird activity that we're involved in. Nothing.” </p>\n<p>The U.S. Department of Justice required RT America to register as an agent of the Russian government after the release of the 2017 intelligence report, forcing RT to disclose its government funding. Dunbar said of the requirement, “We believe that the registration demand for RT America — staffed by American journalists covering American news for American audiences — contradicts the ideals of both democracy and freedom of speech. It deprives us of fair competition with other international channels, which are not registered as foreign agents.”</p>\n<p>Because RT.com has published false information and distorted coverage to support the views of the Russian government that owns it, NewsGuard has determined that the website does not gather and present information responsibly, and does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>In response to additional NewsGuard inquiries in January 2019 about RT’s coverage of Skripal’s poisoning, the 2016 U.S. election, and the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies and Ofcom, </p>\n<p>Dunbar wrote, “We confirm that we have received your inquiry and are processing your request.”</p>\n<p>RT regularly updates articles and publishes corrections when an error has been made, typically as an editor’s note at the bottom of the story. “RT is committed to facts-based reporting,” Dunbar told NewsGuard. “If a good-faith error occurs, we always correct it and let our audience know.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Most articles on RT.com do not name the author, although op-ed columns do identify them. </p>\n<p>“Many news stories are a collaborative effort, rather than the work of a single person — which is why this is a common practice within the international news space,” Dunbar told NewsGuard.</p>\n<p>RT.com provides biographies of the network’s on-air reporters, some of whom include links to their social media profiles. Biographies for RT’s editorial leadership are listed on a Management page. General email addresses for many RT departments are listed on the site’s contact page. Russian phone numbers are also listed for some departments.</p>\n<p>RT discloses on the About page of its website that it is “publicly financed from the budget of the Russian Federation.” The site also describes its relationship to ANO TV-Novosti.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>RT grew out of a decision in 2005 by the Russian government to extend its public opinion activities outside the country. Funded by the government, the broadcast channel launched as Russia Today in 2005. In 2009, it changed its name to RT (obscuring its status as an entity funded by the Russian government), began paying U.S. cable companies to carry its channel, and launched a newsroom in Washington the following year.</p>\n<p>The network focused on the internet as social media began to grow in popularity. In 2013, RT became the first news organization to gain more than 1 billion views on YouTube. In 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that the English-language version of RT was close to CNN in having among the most views and subscribers for news channels on YouTube, with 2.1 billion views and 2.2 million subscribers.</p>\n<p>There have been several incidents of RT correspondents resigning due to the requirements of propaganda. In 2014, Washington anchor Liz Wahl resigned when the network refused to air a reference she made to Russia’s intervention in Ukraine, Wahl explained in an article entitled, “I was Putin’s Pawn” published by Politico magazine. “I’d been a correspondent for RT — the English-language international cable network funded by the Russian government — for about two and a half years. I’d looked the other way as the network smeared America for the sake of making the Kremlin look better by comparison, while it sugarcoated atrocities by one brutal dictator after another.” </p>\n<p>A London-based correspondent, Sara Firth, resigned in 2014 in protest of RT’s coverage of the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in Ukraine. RT.com stories backed the government’s contention that Russia or its allies were not involved in the plane crash.</p>\n<p>Following concerns about Russian interference in the U.S. election, Twitter reported that RT had paid to promote its tweets and stopped taking their ads. In addition, YouTube removed RT from among the premium channels for which advertisers must pay higher prices. RT had been among the preferred advertising outlets on YouTube, a status for the top 5 percent of channels most popular among young viewers.</p>\n<p>“Even though RT was removed from the program without any notice, Google has publically [sic] stated that it found no evidence that RT manipulated YouTube or violated its policies during the 2016 U.S. election campaign,” Dunbar told NewsGuard. “This speaks to the unprecedented political pressure increasingly applied to all RT partners and relationships in a concerted effort to push our channel out of the U.S. market entirely, and by any means possible.”</p>\n<p><em>Corrections: An earlier version of this label erroneously reported that RT Deutsch was among RT’s broadcast channels. RT Deutsch only publishes online content. An earlier version of the label also misidentified the name of Malaysia Airlines, and misstated the date that RT launched its Washington newsroom. An earlier version of the label also erroneously reported that RT was close to CNN in having the most views and subscribers on YouTube. In fact, while RT was close to CNN in popularity, the two networks were among the most popular channels on YouTube among news organizations, not all brands.</em></p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This
