The foundation is headed by John R. MacArthur, who also serves as president and publisher of Harper’s Magazine, and is largely funded by him. IRS filings show that the foundation generated $6.9 million in revenue in 2016. John R. MacArthur donated $4.4 million in 2016 to the Harper's Magazine Foundation through his own nonprofit, the Roderick MacArthur Foundation, which exclusively supports Harper's Magazine.</p>\n<p>MacArthur, a former journalist, is the son of J. Roderick MacArthur, who established the MacArthur “genius” grant, and the grandson of insurance magnate John D. MacArthur.</p>\n<p>Harper’s derives revenue from subscriptions and advertisements. Many articles on the site are only available to print subscribers. The site also sells merchandise and books.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Harper’s Magazine publishes original essays, fiction, and longform reporting on culture, politics, and social issues. The magazine also features photography and poetry.</p>\n<p>The website's blog section, called Browsings, contains the magazine's most popular features, such as the Harper’s Index — a list of obscure statistics and numbers — and the Findings column, which includes illustrated collections of surprising facts and scientific discoveries. The blog also provides commentary and a weekly news in review. The Readings section includes excerpts from books, articles, and other outside sources. The site also features interview podcasts hosted by Harper’s writers and contributors.</p>\n<p>The magazine's longform content provides in-depth reporting and analysis on national and international issues, often from a liberal perspective. For example, a March 2018 article, titled “Mobbed Up,” reported on the U.S. role in the Afghan opium trade. A October 2018 article, headlined \"Checkpoint Nation,\" examined how the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency has been increasingly conducting arrests and searches in U.S. cities.</p>\n<p>Harper’s has written extensively about environment issues, including an article in 2018 about plans to build copper mines on a sacred Native American site in Arizona and another about an outbreak of anthrax in Russia, caused by the melting of its permafrost. Other articles published in 2018 covered rising religious intolerance against Muslims in Uttar Pradesh, India; the persecution of Christian communities in Iraq; and anti-Semitism inside Britain’s Labour Party.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Harper's articles generally rely on multiple interviews with officials, advocates, and first-hand witnesses, often gathered over months of reporting. Articles often cite primary source documents, such as government reports and scientific studies. Harper’s articles sometimes take on a point of view, as is common in magazine journalism, but are typically fact-based and measured.</p>\n<p>Commentary and cultural reviews are labelled as such.</p>\n<p>The website regularly posts corrections explaining errors and how they were corrected.</p>\n<p>Harper’s Magazine has won 19 National Magazine Awards over the last 40 years, including three general excellence awards and four for reviews and criticism. In 2011, the magazine won a National Magazine Award for Best Reporting, for “The Guantanamo 'Suicides,'” which revealed that the Obama administration had failed to investigate a cover-up of the suspicious deaths of three inmates at Guantánamo Naval Base's prison camp.</p>\n<p>Harper’s won an Overseas Press Club award in 2004 for best international reporting, for “Beyond Fallujah: A Year with the Iraqi Resistance,” a profile of Iraqi fighters. The magazine won that award again in 2013, for “The Homeless Herd: An Indian Village Battles an Elephant Invasion,\" about a herd of displaced elephants that frequently raided Indian villages for food. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Harper's online articles do not generally include information about authors. The magazine offers PDF versions of its print articles, which include author biographies, but these copies are only available to print subscribers.</p>\n<p>The site's Masthead page provides the names of Harper's editorial staff and lists MacArthur as its publisher and president. But the site does not offer any contact or biographical information about its editors.</p>\n<p>\"Authors who appear in the [print] magazine have short bios that appear at the bottom of articles,\" Violet Lucca, web editor of Harper’s Magazine, told NewsGuard in an email. “We have the masthead on the website and in print.”</p>\n<p>The site's About page states that the Harper’s Magazine Foundation is \"dedicated to promoting Harper’s Magazine as an independent voice in American culture,\" but it does not clearly say that the magazine is owned by the foundation. Also, the site does not disclose that it is largely funded by the publisher's own foundation, the Roderick MacArthur Foundation. Therefore, the site does not meet NewsGuard’s transparency standard for ownership and financing.  </p>\n<p>\"There is some information about our main donor, John R. MacArthur, on the history page of our website,\" Lucca said.</p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The book publishing company Harper &#x26; Brothers, run by the Harper family of New York, founded Harper's New Monthly Magazine in June 1850, making it the second-oldest title in the U.S. (Scientific American launched five years earlier.)</p>\n<p>The publication became Harper's Monthly Magazine in 1900 and Harper's Magazine in 1913. In its early years, it featured articles and book excerpts by prominent British and American novelists, including Horatio Alger, Henry James, Charles Dickens, and Mark Twain. The magazine was also known for illustrations from renowned painters and illustrators, including Winslow Homer, Frederic Sackrider Remington, and Mathew Brady, one of the first American photographers.</p>\n<p>Harper's has published many prominent American fiction writers, often in the early years of their careers. Among them were William Faulkner, Truman Capote, Arthur Miller, J. D. Salinger, and James Baldwin. It also published essays by political leaders, including Woodrow Wilson, Winston Churchill, and Theodore Roosevelt. In 1947, President Truman's Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, wrote a controversial piece defending the bombing of Hiroshima. </p>\n<p>In 1965, Harper’s Magazine was acquired by the Cowles Media Company, a now-defunct publisher based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. By 1980, the magazine was struggling financially, and Cowles announced its dissolution. According to a history of the magazine on the site, John R. MacArthur convinced his grandfather's nonprofit, the MacArthur Foundation, and the Atlantic Richfield Foundation, to rescue the magazine with a gift of $3 million, which would help set up the Harper’s Magazine Foundation. Two years later, MacArthur quit his job as a junior editor at UPI to become the publisher of Harper's Magazine. Lewis Lapham edited the magazine from 1976 to 1981 and from 1983 to 2006.</p>\n<p>In April 2018, MacArthur fired the editor of Harper's Magazine, James Marcus, for opposing the publication of “a contrarian piece on #MeToo movement,” Marcus told the New York Times in an interview. The article was MacArthur’s idea and was assigned over Marcus' objections, he said. Harper's vice president of public relations, Giulia Melucci, disputed Marcus' account and told the Times that the published piece, “The Other Whisper Network: How Twitter feminism is bad for women,” by Katie Roiphe, had been “the most successful story we’ve had in a couple years.”</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSophia Tewa\n\nEdited by:\nEric Effron&#x26;emsp;Yemile
