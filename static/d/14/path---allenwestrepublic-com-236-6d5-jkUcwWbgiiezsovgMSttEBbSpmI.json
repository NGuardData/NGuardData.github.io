The website derives revenue through advertising.</p>\n<p>The site is hosted and was developed by Klicked Media, a company that offers website hosting, development, and advertising services. Klicked Media is owned by Liberty Alliance, LLC, a company run by Brandon and Jared Vallorani, who operate many conservative sites proven to publish false claims and conspiracy theories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Articles contain excerpts from news stories published in external sources, accompanied by a brief commentary from Great American Republic writers and a link to the original article. Articles typically come from conservative sites like the Daily Wire, TheBlaze, Fox News, and American Thinker.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The website’s “About Me” page clearly discloses its mission: to articulate “American Principles &#x26; Values,” according to its tagline. The Great American Republic Twitter page describes the site as representing “a Republic of conservatives,” but the site itself does not state its conservative leaning. Its conservative perspective is clear, however, in the stories it chooses to cover and the language it uses to do so. For example, headlines often include sentiments such as “The Left and the media hate Sarah because they hate Trump voters” (referring to Sarah Huckabee Sanders, President Donald Trump’s press secretary), “Have liberals pushed our Country to the edge of the abyss?” and “Absolute Proof The Left Is Outright Calling You Stupid.”</p>\n<p>Other headlines contain misleading information, such as, “Is the term ‘climate change science’ an Oxymoron?” This story reported on a judge’s order that energy companies present all the information they had on climate change and their role in it, without calling into question the existence of this scientific phenomenon. But the story, from McClatchy, makes clear that the judge asked for comprehensive information about climate change -- a “tutorial.” Another article titled “Did California Just Make It Easier To Vote More Than Once?” described a glitch that may have duplicated voter registration forms. But the original story said that the problem had been an error, was not an intentional act, and was “being resolved.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, the site’s commentaries make claims that promote debunked conspiracy theories. In one article about a bill in Rhode Island that would require all presidential candidates to submit their U.S. tax returns to get on the state’s presidential ballot, the author wrote, “It is too bad that birth certificates proving a candidate was born in the United States were not required in past elections,” referring to claims that Barack Obama had a fake birth certificate and was not born in the U.S. </p>\n<p>GreatAmericanRepublic.com appears to have only two staff members: Tanya Grimsley, its founder and editor-in-chief, and her father Paul, an op-ed commentator and writer. The site details a thorough corrections policy and urges readers to report any errors. Articles provide links to external sources for the original stories, and all photos come from “Wiki Commons Public domain and YouTube screengrabs,” according to the “About Me” page.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>While links are included to the original sources of news stories, articles do not contain bylines disclosing which Great American Republic author wrote the commentary accompanying each news story. The site’s “About Me” page provides biographical information about its content creators, but there is no clear way to get in touch with the site except through a general contact form.</p>\n<p>Stories in an “Around the Web” column in the site’s margins are not labeled as advertisements, and are presented in the same font and formatting as internal articles.</p>\n<p>Great American Republic did not respond to two submitted contact forms seeking information about its headlines, false claims, article sourcing, and lack of bylines. In addition, Jared Vallorani, the CEO of Liberty Alliance, did not respond to three NewsGuard emails requesting comment on editorial issues on Liberty Alliance’s sites.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>GreatAmericanRepublic.com was founded in 2009 by Tanya Grimsley, who became politically active promoting the congressional candidacy of Colonel Allen West, a military veteran, Tea Party Republican, and former Congressman who is known for making provocative statements.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJulia Press\n\nEdited by:\nJoyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;Steven Brill&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://greatamericanrepublic.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">https://greatamericanrepublic.com/about/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/inside-the-partisan-fight-for-your-news-feed?utm_term=.gsw3N2oODr#.gcM2D3kR5Q\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/inside-the-partisan-fight-for-your-news-feed?utm_term=.gsw3N2oODr#.gcM2D3kR5Q</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zoominfo.com/c/klicked-media/436212396\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.zoominfo.com/c/klicked-media/436212396</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jvallorani/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jvallorani/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vallorani/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/vallorani/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://greatamericanrepublic.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">https://greatamericanrepublic.com/about/</a></li>\n<li>Former Federal Prosecutor Says ‘Rosenstein Deeply Involved in Effort to Try to Remove Trump From Office’ (Video) <a href=\"https://greatamericanrepublic.com/former-federal-prosecutor-says-rosenstein-deeply-involved-in-effort-to-try-to-remove-trump-from-office-video/\" target=\"_blank\">https://greatamericanrepublic.com/former-federal-prosecutor-says-rosenstein-deeply-involved-in-effort-to-try-to-remove-trump-from-office-video/</a></li>\n<li>President Trump switches to post-election hyper-drive <a href=\"https://greatamericanrepublic.com/president-trump-switches-to-post-election-hyper-drive/\" target=\"_blank\">https://greatamericanrepublic.com/president-trump-switches-to-post-election-hyper-drive/</a></li>\n<li>House Democrats Are Coming For Your Guns <a href=\"https://greatamericanrepublic.com/house-democrats-are-coming-for-your-guns/\" target=\"_blank\">https://greatamericanrepublic.com/house-democrats-are-coming-for-your-guns/</a></li>\n<li>Tech Giants are Strangling our Culture and Economy <a href=\"https://greatamericanrepublic.com/tech-giants-are-strangling-our-culture-and-economy/\" target=\"_blank\">https://greatamericanrepublic.com/tech-giants-are-strangling-our-culture-and-economy/</a></li>\n<li>GA Democrat for Governor Stacey Abrams Attempts Election No-No <a href=\"https://greatamericanrepublic.com/ga-democrat-for-governor-stacey-abrams-attempts-election-no-no/\" target=\"_blank\">https://greatamericanrepublic.com/ga-democrat-for-governor-stacey-abrams-attempts-election-no-no/</a></li>\n<li>Umm….
