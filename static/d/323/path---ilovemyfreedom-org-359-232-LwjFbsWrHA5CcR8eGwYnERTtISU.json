The site earns revenue through advertising and merchandise sales, including Donald Trump-related clothing and memorabilia.</p>\n<p>The group also runs the President Donald Trump Fan Club Facebook page. That account has more than 1.4 million followers, and posts articles almost exclusively from ILoveMyFreedom.org.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>In late August 2018, the site added an About Us page, stating that it provides “conservative commentary.” The page also states: “Studies have shown that 90% of the reporting on President Trump is negative, so we like to bring the other side of the story to you. We aren’t shy to admit we’re biased. The majority of our articles will have a good amount of Pro-Trump opinion weaved into it.”</p>\n<p>I Love My Freedom does not conduct original reporting. Rather, stories are usually based on news and commentary articles posted on other outlets, including Fox News, The Washington Free Beacon, the Daily Caller, Breitbart, and BizPac Review. Television appearances by newsmakers and social media posts are also often used as the basis of posts.</p>\n<p>ILoveMyFreedom.org’s writers often frame events to cast liberals and Democrats in a negative light while positively presenting conservative perspectives, in articles such as “Antifa Vandalizes GOP Headquarters In NYC; Leaves Disturbing Message That Needs To Be Investigated,” “Melania’s Office Delivers Fiery Response To ‘The View’ Co-Host Who Called First Lady A ‘Mistress,’” “List Of President Trump’s 289 Accomplishments Goes Viral On Social Media” and “RED WAVE? New York Times Alters Election Day Coverage To Avoid Triggering Readers Again.”</p>\n<p>Site visitors are able to comment about articles at the bottom of each story.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>ILoveMyFreedom.org’s commentary, which is added to summaries of news events as reported by other outlets, has included distorted or misstated facts and unsubstantiated claims. </p>\n<p>For example, in a September 2018 article headlined “TOLERANCE: Police On Scene Of MAGA Event After Democrat’s Mass Shooting Threat,” the author states, “Considering the Democrats respect MS-13 and ANTIFA more than law-abiding Americans, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that their supporters have followed suit.” However, no evidence or sources are provided for the claim that Democrats prefer gang members and the extreme left over “law-abiding Americans.” </p>\n<p>An October 2018 article about the migrant caravan traveling from Central America toward the United States references the group as “Latin Americans with some Middle Easterners mixed in.” Many commentators on the right, and President Trump himself, have suggested that the caravan includes Middle Eastern terrorists, but numerous news outlets have said that there is no credible evidence to support the claim. President Trump has acknowledged that there is “no proof” that the caravan includes Middle Easterners.</p>\n<p>The website has posted several stories making unsubstantiated claims about George Soros, a billionaire hedge fund investor and Democratic mega donor.</p>\n<p>A September 2018 article suggested that Soros orchestrated opposition to the nomination of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh by paying protesters to show up at his confirmation hearings. The article is built around two tweets from Red Nation Rising, an unverified Twitter account. One tweet features a video of three men who claimed that money was given to protestors outside the hearing room. Another tweet features images of a woman protester with money in her hands, with the text “Soros Cash?” and “paid protesters irl,” meaning “in real life.” No evidence, other than the tweets, is included in the I Love My Freedom article to support these claims. </p>\n<p>An Oct. 6, 2018, post stated: “The political left and their deep-pocketed backers including vampiric Hungarian ghoul George Soros spared no amount of money to bus their unhinged rent-a-mobs into D.C. where they swarmed the Capitol Building to clog the hallways, scream and intimidate senators into voting against the judge.” The site provides no sourcing or backup for the claim that Soros spared “no amount of money” to generate the protests. </p>\n<p>Some Republicans, including President Trump, have said that they believe Soros was tied to the protest efforts, but they have not backed that claim with evidence. The Washington Post said its own reporting found no direct link between Soros and the protests. </p>\n<p><br>An October 2016 story stated that Soros was rigging voting machines in 16 states to help Hillary Clinton win the presidential election. “George Soros Has Already Stated That Hillary Will Win The Election No Matter What. This Is Because George And Hillary Have Rigged The Election, Read On,” the subheadline stated. “This is how the globalists and Hillary will rig the election and win,” the article said.</p>\n<p>The website did not provide any information to support the charge. The fact-checking site PolitiFact and news outlets including the Washington Post and ProPublica debunked the claim that the voting machine company in question, Smartmatic, is owned by Soros and also, that the machines were in use in the states mentioned in the article.</p>\n<p>Because the website often misstates or distorts facts to make its case and has published false or misleading claims, NewsGuard has determined that ILoveMyFreedom.org does not gather and present information responsibly or responsibly handle the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<p>Asked about the site’s editorial standards, I Love My Freedom’s head of content, Clayton Keirns, responded in an email: “Our site is known for opinion and we are working towards more and more straightforward content. Our writers have been instructed as of November 7th to strip away any commentary from their articles unless marked” as commentary. He said the site planned to add a “commentary” notation to opinion articles. Keirns added that the site’s writers are “always improving our quality of work” and that “many many MANY” articles posted on ILoveMyFreedom.org are not misleading “in any way.”</p>\n<p>NewsGuard reviewed the website a day after Keirns' statement. Looking at approximately 20 articles, NewsGuard found that the posts were generally factual and cited reporting from other media outlets, with little to no speculation or commentary.</p>\n<p>Stories on ILoveMyFreedom.org sometimes carry deceptive headlines. For example, an article posted in September 2018 was titled “WATCH: Chelsea Clinton DIRECTLY Attacks Christian Beliefs On Preventing Abortion.” In the video, Clinton’ remarked that it would be “un-Christian to me” to deny access to abortion. Clinton did not attack “Christian beliefs,” let alone “directly.”</p>\n<p>Keirns did not address NewsGuard’s inquiry about the site’s headlines.</p>\n<p>In August 2018, ILoveMyFreedom.org’s owners added a Corrections page, which explains how visitors can contact the site to request corrections. The policy states that a notation in red letters will be posted at the top of corrected articles, detailing what information was incorrect and how it was fixed. NewsGuard found two such corrections on the site.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>I Love My Freedom includes a list of its owners on an About Us page. Articles usually include the names of writers, although some are identified only by first name. The website includes short biographies and social media accounts for some of its content creators, but no information is provided for other writers. </p>\n<p>Asked about the site’s limited disclosure about its content creators, Keirns told NewsGuard that some of the site’s authors did not want their last names used because of “the drama that comes with being a political writer.”</p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Co-owner Al Ferretti, a self-described digital marketer and entrepreneur, told NewsGuard that the website started in 2015 with a focus on “independent, conservative, leaning to the right” audiences, with an emphasis on gun rights. Content shifted toward more general political news after Donald Trump began his presidential run, Ferretti said.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note:</em><em> Since this review was originally published, ILoveMyFreedom.org added details </em><em>about its ownership, ideological orientation, and corrections policy</em><em>. NewsGuard amended its evaluation of the website to incorporate the new details. A review of the site also has now determined that it does not gather news and information responsibly and does not adequately handle the difference between news and opinion. These changes are reflected in the Nutrition Label and the accompanying criteria checklist. </em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJoe Danielewicz\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Eric
