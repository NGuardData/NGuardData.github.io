Rossiya Segodnya was set up by decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin in December 2013 as a replacement for Russia’s previous state-run international news agency, RIA Novosti, and its international radio service, Voice of Russia. In an article reporting on its own closure, RIA Novosti characterized the change as “the latest in a series of shifts in Russia’s news landscape, which appear to point toward a tightening of state control in the already heavily regulated media sector.”</p>\n<p>In a separate decree the same day as RIA Novosti’s closure, Putin appointed pro-Kremlin newscaster Dmitry Kiselyov as head of the replacement agency. Rossiya Segodnya launched Sputnik in November 2014.</p>\n<p>The site runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Russian state-owned television network RT described Sputnik as targeting “global audiences with its non-mainstream take on world events.” Sputnik maintains multiple international offices, produces original reporting with a global focus, and is available in over 30 languages. Site sections include World, Business, Opinion, Viral, and Cartoons.</p>\n<p>Sputnik also hosts a large amount of radio content. The organization says on its About page that it broadcasts around 800 hours of radio programming daily. Headlines in July 2018 included “Trump Says Didn't Know About 2016 Meeting With Russians in Trump Tower,” “Ecuador President Says Assange Must Eventually Leave London Embassy,” and “Le Pen Backs Censure of Macron for 'Trying to Hide Facts' in Aide Assault Case.”</p>\n<p>The site regularly runs stories and opinion pieces defending Russian state interests and attacking those of its rivals. Headlines have included “US Illegally Trying to Oust Russian Arms From India Market – Military Observer” (July 2018),  “After Helsinki: Russia Must Be Destroyed” (July 2018), and “John McAfee: 'I Can Promise You It Wasn't Russia Who Hacked the DNC'” (March 2017).</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Alongside fellow Russian state news outlet RT, Sputnik has repeatedly been accused of disseminating propaganda and false information on behalf of the Russian government. In January 2017, the Swedish Institute of International Affairs accused Sputnik of running misleading reports in a deliberate bid to influence Swedish public opinion. In April 2017 then-French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron’s campaign team banned Sputnik and RT from his campaign events, claiming the outlets had a “systematic desire to issue fake news and false information.” In November 2017, Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt announced Google News would be “deranking” Sputnik and RT — making them appear lower down on search results — because, he said, they had encouraged the “spread of misinformation — or worse.”</p>\n<p>Many articles run on Sputnik feature original reporting or are attributed to at least one other media source. Articles consistently credit the sources for their photographs. However, the outlet occasionally runs dubiously sourced stories that make Russia’s rivals look bad.</p>\n<p>For example, an article in April 2018 headlined “Gryffindor Losing Its Points: Hitler ‘Outreads’ Harry Potter in Latvia” bases its claim on “Mein Kampf” outperforming the Harry Potter series on a single, obscure Latvian book sales website. A February 2018 article titled “US Helicopters Spotted in Al-Hasakah Reportedly Evacuating Daesh Members (VIDEO)” alleges that U.S. forces have been evacuating ISIS members from a prison in Syria. The article provides no evidence for this claim except for an anonymous source and a video that shows only a distant helicopter landing. A column featured on Sputnik in November 2015 headlined “Why British Haste on Plane Bomb Theory?” suggests, spuriously, that British agents might have been behind the bombing of Russian Metrojet Flight 9267, which crashed in Egypt in October 2015. The author offers no evidence.</p>\n<p>In June 2017 Sputnik ran a story in its Politics section headlined “Unresolved Murder: Why Seth Rich’s Case is Key to #TrumpRussia Investigation.” In the article, Sputnik treats as credible a commentator’s unfounded comments suggesting Democratic National Congress staffer Seth Rich was murdered for passing confidential DNC information to WikiLeaks. In addition to uncritically carrying the claim that “Rich's death could have been part of a massive conspiracy aimed at appointing Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as successor to Barack Obama,” the website also uses the theory to refute allegations the Russian government meddled in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. The site wrote, “Back in August 2016, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange dropped a hint that Rich could have been behind the leak. If that is true, the Democrats' narrative that Russia had \"meddled\" in the US 2016 presidential election will fall apart like a house of cards.”</p>\n<p>In August 2017 Politico ran an article titled “My Life at a Russian Propaganda Network” about former Sputnik White House correspondent Andrew Feinberg’s experience working for the outlet. Feinberg claimed in the article that his work for Sputnik was censored if it suggested anything negative about the Russian government, that he was fed questions for the White House by his editors, and that he was ultimately fired for refusing to “start asking about the Seth Rich case.” Sputnik responded that Feinberg was let go for “performance related issues.” Sputnik also pointed to tweets Feinberg made during his tenure at Sputnik defending the outlet’s reliability.</p>\n<p>Because the site regularly publishes poorly sourced or debunked claims, and does not disclose a pro-Russia viewpoint, NewsGuard has determined that it does not gather and present information responsibly, nor does it responsibly handle the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<p>Sputnik regularly fails to distinguish opinion from news reporting. In July 2018, for example, the headlines “Trump Accused of 'Treason' for Doing What Bush, Obama Were Praised for – Analyst;” “Build it in Britain? Corbyn's Industrial Policy Is Just What UK Needs;” and “EXCLUSIVE: Why Everything the Western Media Tells You About Venezuela is Lies” all ran under the website’s “All News” tab.</p>\n<p>Sputnik does not have a dedicated corrections page or a stated corrections policy, although the site sometimes corrects its articles and publishes corrections on social media.</p>\n<p>Sputnik News did not respond to two NewsGuard emails inquiring about its editorial standards, including its publishing for false news, its mixing of news and opinion, and its lack of corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site does not disclose that it is owned and funded by the Russian government. Sputnik notes on its About page only that “The SPUTNIK online media outlet was registered by the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology, and Mass Media (Roskomnadzor) on November 17, 2014.” It further describes on its Privacy Policy page that it is controlled by “Federal State Unitary Enterprise Rossiya Segodnya International Information Agency” (Rossiya Segodnya), without revealing that Rossiya Segodnya is owned by the Russian government.</p>\n<p>The website names its editor-in-chief on its About page, but no contact or other information is provided. Most articles do not name their authors.</p>\n<p>In the Politico article, Feinberg claimed that Sputnik has a policy of not including bylines, because, he surmised, “no one can be held accountable for errors, lies and half-truths in any given story.”</p>\n<p>The site clearly labels advertisements.</p>\n<p>Sputnik News did not respond to two NewsGuard emails inquiring about its lack of disclosure of its ownership and content creators.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Rossiya Segodnya’s predecessor, RIA Novosti, was founded in 1941 as the Soviet Information Bureau. Voice of Russia, the forerunner to Sputnik’s radio programming arm, was founded in 1929 as Radio Moscow. While Rossiya Segodnya translates to “Russia Today,” it is a separate entity from the Russian state-controlled television network RT (formerly known as Russia Today).</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written
