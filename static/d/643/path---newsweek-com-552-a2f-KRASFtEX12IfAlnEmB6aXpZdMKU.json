A previous owner, the Washington Post Co., sold the newsweekly to stereo magnate Sidney Harman in 2010, who merged it with The Daily Beast and put Daily Beast co-founder Tina Brown, who previously ran Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, in charge of the joint operation. In 2012, Newsweek ceased publication of the print edition to save money, but the print version was restarted in 2014.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Newsweek.com states that its mission is to provide \"the latest news, in-depth analysis and ideas about international issues, technology, business, culture and politics.\" The site features national and international news produced by a staff of Newsweek reporters and editors, along with political analysis and opinion pieces from a range of perspectives. </p>\n<p>Newsweek.com has sections on culture, health, business, sports, science, and technology. Many web stories are accompanied by a related video, and the website also publishes photo slideshow stories. Readers can subscribe to print and electronic versions of the publication. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Newsweek has made a number of high-profile missteps in recent years (see below) and has been chided by press critics who say the one-time powerhouse has been in decline. However, most of the articles on Newsweek.com are balanced and well-sourced, and the site fulfills NewsGuard’s criteria relating to corrections and transparency. Therefore, NewsGuard has determined that Newsweek.com gathers and reports news responsibly.</p>\n<p>The site does not articulate a formal corrections policy, but it appends corrections to articles found to contain errors, with a note explaining what was corrected. It also encourages readers to contact staff about any errors, and provides a link at the bottom of stories where readers can ask for corrections. The site has a page that contains a list of corrected stories.</p>\n<p>In January 2018, the Manhattan district attorney’s office raided Newsweek’s offices as part of an investigation into the parent company’s finances. Newsweek Media Group said at the time that the investigation was not about content-related issues, and it pledged to cooperate with authorities.</p>\n<p>Coming as the news organization struggled with a string of errors -- including having to retract an erroneous report that the girlfriend of the Las Vegas shooter was married to two men and used two social security numbers -- the raid gave rise to a staff uprising as journalists attempted to write about the company’s woes. Several top editorial managers and others were fired or quit.</p>\n<p>Newsweek eventually ran a story about its own problems, adding a note from the editors that said the earlier handling of the article “involved egregious breaches of confidentiality and journalism ethics. We believe that subjects of the story were shown parts of the draft, if not the entire piece, prior to publication….  A senior Newsweek Media Group executive said the company's owners would ensure independent review and newsroom autonomy going forward.”</p>\n<p>Chairman Etienne Uzac, a co-owner of the parent company, and his wife, Marion Kim, the company's finance director, stepped down from their formal positions in February 2018. Veteran journalist Nancy Cooper, who previously served in editing roles at the magazine and the website, was named global editor-in-chief.  </p>\n<p>In September 2018, Newsweek announced it was splitting from IBT Media and becoming a standalone company. In October 2018, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office indicted Uzac and IBT for allegedly helping to orchestrate a $10 million fraud scheme, which prosecutors said included creating a fictitious auditor who supposedly signed off on the company’s books.</p>\n<p>The first print issue of Newsweek published under the leadership of IBT, in March 2014, ran a cover story that claimed to have uncovered the identity of the founder of Bitcoin, a top cryptocurrency. Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, the man the story identified as Bitcoin’s founder, denied Newsweek’s claims in an interview with The Associated Press shortly after Newsweek ran its report. The story was widely criticized by the media and digital enthusiasts, because many believed that it did not provide conclusive evidence that Nakamoto created Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>Critics pointed to weak parts of Newsweek’s case, including the lack of evidence that Nakamoto was proficient in cryptography and his family’s financial struggles, which do not befit somebody whose net worth is estimated to be in the billions. Newsweek issued a statement defending its reporting.</p>\n<p>A shift in Newsweek's leadership in 2017 resulted in the site placing greater emphasis on increasing web traffic, at the expense of careful reporting, according to former and current Newsweek journalists quoted in a February 2018 article on Slate.com. They cited stories stories Newsweek ran in October 2017 and January 2018 detailing scenarios in which Hillary Clinton, who lost to Donald Trump in November 2016, could still become president. The far-fetched theory put forward in the articles held that if both President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence were impeached and House Speaker Paul Ryan became president, Ryan could then name Clinton as his vice president and step down, allowing her to become president. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site lists all staff writers and editors. Readers can click on most writer’s bylines, some of which include a short biography along with contact information. Ads are labeled. Sponsored content is marked as “Sponsor Insight.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Newsweek was founded in 1933 by a former Time editor and carved out a reputation as a scrappy rival to the much bigger Time (“Avis to Time’s Hertz,” as former longtime staffer Jonathan Alter has written). Newsweek.com was launched in 1998.</p>\n<p>In 2000, Newsweek.com joined with NBC to form Newsweek.MSNBC.com, but re-launched again in 2007 as a standalone site. The company also publishes weekly English print editions in the United States, Europe/Middle East/Africa and Asia.</p>\n<p>Newsweek has won multiple journalism awards over the years, including for its coverage of the aftermath of the Vietnam War, the presidential campaign trail, and the war on terror. In 2016, it was a finalist for a National Magazine Award in the category of General Excellence in News, Sports, and Entertainment.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nCrystal Yednak\n\nEdited by:\nJim
