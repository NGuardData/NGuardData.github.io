No owner is disclosed and the site is registered through Domains by Proxy, an Arizona-based company which allows website owners to remain anonymous. The site runs some advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>GeologyIn.com focuses on news about geology, minerals, fossils, volcanoes and earthquakes. The homepage features two separate photo gallery sections, one covering interesting-looking gemstones and another covering geological formations.</p>\n<p>The site frequently republishes articles and press releases about geological research from universities. For example, a September 2018 story headlined “Study: Kidney Stones Have Distinct Geological Histories,” is taken from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Although Geologyin.com’s content is fact-based and generally reliable, NewsGuard has found that multiple articles on the site are word-for-word republications from research institutions and other news sites.</p>\n<p>The nine most recent stories on the site’s homepage as of Sept. 24, 2018, were all taken from another site. Six of them credit the universities or research organizations which originally published the articles, although they do not specify the articles copy other material verbatim. For example, a September 2018 story on the assembly of a dinosaur skeleton in Japan has a note at the end saying, “The above story is based on materials provided by Hokkaido University.” GeologyIn.com does not say that the story copies a university press release.</p>\n<p>Other stories only link to scientific journals that produced research, but not the original site that produced the article. For example, the Sept. 19, 2018, article “Geoscientists Find Unexpected 'Deep Creep' Near San Andreas, San Jacinto Faults,” says the study was published in the journal Geophysical Research Letter. There is no mention that the article was copied from the news site for the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.</p>\n<p>GeologyIn.com has also plagiarized articles from other news organizations. In one example, a September 2018 article about glowing rocks found in Michigan is identical to an article published by CBS News in the same month. A June 2018 article, “Earthquakes Rock Kilauea's Summit, Lava Covers Nearly 5,000 Acres,” is nearly identical to a CNN article with the same headline. The article that appears on GeologyIn.com omits the last two paragraphs found in the CNN story.</p>\n<p>Because GeologyIn.com has been found to copy entire articles from other sites without attribution, NewsGuard has determined that it fails to gather and present information responsibly.</p>\n<p>The site does not have a corrections policy and no examples of corrections could be found.</p>\n<p>Three NewsGuard emails sent through the site’s contact form and one Facebook message asking about the instances of plagiarism and lack of corrections were not returned.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>GeologyIn.com does not identify its owners, content creators or site leaders. The site’s About page redirects to the Contact Us page, which offers only a general contact form. Advertisements are clearly labeled.</p>\n<p>Three emails sent through the site’s contact form and one Facebook message asking about the lack of information about ownership, who’s in charge of the site and who provides the content were not returned.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site was registered in October 2014. The Amazing Geologist Facebook page, which links  to the website, was launched in March 2013, according to its About page.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJeremy Binckes\n\nEdited by:\nAmy
