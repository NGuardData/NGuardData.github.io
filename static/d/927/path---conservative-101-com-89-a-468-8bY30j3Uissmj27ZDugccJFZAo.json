The company’s domain records on corporationwiki.com list Tyler Shapiro and John Crane as officers of the company, which is registered in Florida. </p>\n<p>The site runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Conservative101.com publishes articles focused on the news media’s coverage of politics. Almost all stories on its home page either cover comments made by television anchors or media personalities, or politicians’ interviews on television. Videos are embedded in social media posts in the text, but are not clickable from the home page. Headlines are sensational, cherry-picking quotes and using charged language, such as the August 2018 headline “Hillary Clinton Honors 11-Year-Old Girl For Insulting American Soldiers ‘Keep Up The Good Work!’”</p>\n<p>Articles are published under one general category. Most articles cover news related to the media, with headlines such as “Economist Triggers CNN Host With Facts ‘Whatever Trump’s Doing On The Economy, It Sure Is Working’” (July 2018) and “Harvard Lawyer Traps Avenatti On Live TV After Exposing How He Broke The Law” (July 2018).</p>\n<p>Much coverage is devoted to CNN’s anchors and how it reports on political news stories. The site also publishes negative stories about Democrats, regularly referring to liberals as “moronic” or “disgusting,” proclaiming that they have been “eviscerated” by Republican commentators or politicians (“Candace Owens Eviscerates Liberals For Calling Laura Ingraham A Racist In Epic Rant,” August 2018).</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Most Conservative101.com articles focus on segments that have run on cable news of anchors and politicians, inserting commentary that critiques the left and the media it references.</p>\n<p>Although the stories appear to quote the segments accurately, headlines are misleading and information from other sources can be misconstrued.</p>\n<p>For example, a headline from August 2018, “NYC Mayor De Blasio Makes Move To Ban Fox News Now That Infowars Has Been Banned,” accompanied an article in which De Blasio stated, “If you could remove News Corp from the last 25 years of American history, we would be in an entirely different place.” The article does not say that De Blasio wanted to ban Fox News or News Corp. </p>\n<p>A July 2018 headline, “David Hogg Warns That If You Don’t Vote Democrat, Everyone In America Will Be Dead Within 2 Years,” referred to a tweet stating, “These Midterms could be the last election of our lifetime. VOTE.”</p>\n<p>Some stories are purely speculative. An August 2016 story titled “BREAKING: Fox News Exposes Traitor Megyn Kelly, Kicks Her Out For Backing Hillary,” stated without sources that Kelly would be leaving Fox News because she “unthinkably, seems to be a closet liberal who actually wants Hillary to win.” Kelly left Fox News for NBC News when her contract expired in 2017. She was not fired.</p>\n<p>Conservative101.com does not disclose a mission or a point of view on its site, although its parent company owns hyperpartisan sites that take opposing positions on the news.</p>\n<p>In a February 2017 article, Craig Silverman, a media editor at BuzzFeed, published an article titled “This is How Your Hyperpartisan Political News Gets Made.” He shared an example on how two sites owned by American Media LLC, conservative101.com and liberalsociety.com,  presented alternate versions of a false story that reported Kellyanne Conway was fired by the White House. </p>\n<p>Liberalsociety.com covered the story in an article titled “White House FINALLY Gives Kellyanne Conway The Boot, Are You Glad?” (February 2017) while conservative101.com wrote about the news under the headline “White House Just Gave Conway The Boot, Prepare To Be Infuriated” (February 2017). Both websites use the same sources and tweets in their articles, but framed the story to appeal to different common partisan opinions.</p>\n<p>Conservative101.com does not list a corrections policy and does not regularly publish corrections. NewsGuard attempted to contact conservative101.com for more information about its editorial practices, submitting two messages through the website’s “Contact Us” form, but received no response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The website offers no information about its owner, financing, or staff. All articles featured after January 22, 2018, are published under the same byline, “Donald.” Prior to that date, some articles were published under the byline “Chris Reynolds.” A Contact Us form allows users to submit inquiries, but lists no contact emails or names.</p>\n<p>Two inquiries sent through the website’s Contact Us form asking about its owners and who publishes and edits its stories received no response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The website’s domain was registered in 2011 and updated in 2016.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nKat Harling\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie
