Inc. Its parent company is Verizon Media Group, formerly Oath Inc. Verizon Media Group is a digital media subsidiary of Verizon Communications, a New York-based public telecommunications company. Verizon Media Group also owns and operates AOL.com and HuffingtonPost.com.</p>\n<p>Yahoo.com primarily generates revenue through search and display advertising, as well as from Yahoo Shopping, the company’s e-commerce branch.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Yahoo.com is a search engine, email provider, and news aggregator that provides a curated feed of stories, largely published from third-party news sources. It aggregates content from publications ranging from Fox News and the Daily Mail to The Associated Press and ABC News. Yahoo frequently packages together three stories on the same topic, often from different sources. An algorithm helps populate the feed for Yahoo.com and several other pages, such as News and Entertainment. The algorithm tracks the stories’ popularity and users’ personal browsing habits. </p>\n<p>Original Yahoo News content includes news articles, videos, and podcasts. For example, Yahoo News produces a Skullduggery video and podcast series that chronicles “scandals in the Trump era.” Yahoo also publishes “Matt Bai’s Political World,” a recurring opinion column written by Bai.</p>\n<p>Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Sports are housed on separate domains. The site also links to Tumblr, a blogging platform purchased by Yahoo in 2013.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Yahoo News’ original reporting is fact-based and objective. Headlines accurately represent content. Its staff includes chief investigative correspondent Michael Isikoff, formerly of NBC and Newsweek, and Bai, former New York Times Magazine political correspondent. Daniel Klaidman, Yahoo News’ editor-in-chief, said the site has an editorial team of about 65 people, who are primarily full-time staffers.</p>\n<p>Original Yahoo News content and aggregated articles typically link to sources within articles and provide image attribution. Sources generally include firsthand interviews and third-party news outlets such as NBC News, the Washington Post, The Associated Press, and Reuters.</p>\n<p>The site corrects errors and appends correction notices, typically at the bottom of articles.</p>\n<p>Users on an open forum on Yahoo’s Feedback page have criticized the news provider of both a liberal and a conservative bias in its curation of news stories. “We take our role seriously holding powerful people and government officials accountable -- regardless of party or political affiliation,” Klaidman told NewsGuard in 2019.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Yahoo News won an Edward R. Murrow Award from the Radio Television Digital News Association for its documentary “Uniquely Nasty,”  exploring “a dark and little-known chapter in America’s recent political past, when gays and lesbians were barred from working for the federal government,” according to a story accompanying the film.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Original Yahoo articles name their authors and usually connect to the writer’s Twitter handle and biographical information. Articles aggregated from other news websites provide the name of the publication and usually name the author. A Contact Us button at the top of the site leads to a feedback page that enables users to submit questions and comments.</p>\n<p>Yahoo does not centrally provide information about its editorial or managerial leadership, nor does it clearly state its ownership. “We’re in the process of redesigning our page that will soon reflect ownership, masthead, and ways to contact Yahoo for corrections and clarifications,” Klaidman told NewsGuard.</p>\n<p>Sponsored content is labeled, and advertising is distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Yahoo was founded in 1994 by two students at Stanford University and became a key player in the dot-com boom in the late 1990s. It is still one of the most-visited sites on the internet. Yahoo increasingly struggled to compete with Google in the early 2000s. It experimented with different content, including travel, food, and technology sites and a news broadcast anchored by veteran newscaster Katie Couric. Couric left Yahoo in 2017 after four years.</p>\n<p>In 2008, Yahoo rejected a $47.5 billion purchase offer from Microsoft Corporation.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Yahoo disclosed two massive breaches that had affected more than 1 billion users; that figure was later updated to include all 3 billion accounts. The company cooperated with federal investigations and said the second breach was believed to be the work of a “state-sponsored actor.” It required affected users to change their email passwords.</p>\n<p>In 2017, Verizon bought the company for $4.48 billion. </p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: Upon further review, this Nutrition Label has been updated, and its rating has changed to reflect that Yahoo.com does not clearly disclose its ownership to users. It has also been updated with new comment from Yahoo News’ editor in chief.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling\n\nEdited by:\nSarah Brandt&#x26;emsp;Amy
