Dupree also founded the conservative-oriented internet radio network We Are American Radio, or WAAR. The site is funded primarily through advertising. Dupree also solicits donations on the website and his radio show. Dupree has appeared as a commentator on CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>In the Our Mission section, Dupree states that he is serving “a community that believes in the American Dream: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” The site describes Dupree’s philosophy as “constitutional conservatism.”</p>\n<p>WayneDupree.com primarily publishes articles about national U.S. news and politics based on stories from other news sources. Dupree adds his commentary and relies on a range of media outlets, including conservative sites such as DailyWire.com and TruePundit.com, as well as organizations such as The Washington Post.</p>\n<p>The site organizes content into sections including Donald Trump, Culture, Entertainment, Politics, World Affairs, and Viral Videos. Recent episodes of Dupree’s radio show are available for streaming.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Dupree, the founder and owner, writes all content, he told NewsGuard in a phone interview. Waynedupree.com is intended to be a news website, he said, although he acknowledged that it “looks more like a blog,” with first-person references found in the majority of stories.</p>\n<p>Dupree does not attempt to break news or provide original reporting. “Sometimes I hit the jackpot where a story is not getting play on those websites but it was produced on those websites, and I put my spin on it and it catches on,” Dupree told NewsGuard. </p>\n<p>Most stories on WayneDupree.com rely on a single source, with posts of tweets sometimes also included. For example, an August 2018 piece was titled, “Fox News Brit Hume SLAMS Trump For Not Saying A ‘Kind Word’ To John McCain.” The piece is based on three tweets from Fox News host Brit Hume. Dupree writes: “It’s bizarre and weird how the media thinks speaking kind and praising the late lawmaker from Arizona will get him into heaven.”</p>\n<p>Dupree described his political views to NewsGuard as independent conservatism. He does occasionally criticize Republicans on his radio show and site. In August 2018, he ran a piece critical of Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter of California, who was indicted with his wife for allegedly misusing campaign funds for personal use.</p>\n<p>The site’s editorial practices do not include a process for vetting information before it is published. A NewsGuard review of Wayne Dupree.com in August 2018 found multiple examples of stories based on unsubstantiated or discredited information. That is why NewsGuard has determined that WayneDupree.com does not meet the criterion for gathering and presenting information responsibly.</p>\n<p>An August 2018 piece titled, “Lisa Page Reportedly Alerts Committee Chinese Was Responsible For Hacking Hillary’s Emails, Not Russia!,” was based on an article by True Pundit, which has repeatedly published unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. True Pundit’s story cites anonymous sources, and it has been disputed by the lawyer for Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer involved in investigations of Hillary Clinton’s private email server and the Trump presidential campaign’s alleged ties to Russia. Dupree’s commentary included the statement, “The opposition media has been in coordination with the Democrats to push the story about Russia hacking the 2016 Presidential election, and now it seems it was China.” </p>\n<p>Another August 2018 article titled, “Journalist Who Filed Sexual Assault Victim Claim For Client Against Bill Clinton Dies Of Seizure,” is also based on a story by True Pundit. In the article Dupree writes, “So many bodies have fallen at the feet of the Clintons but they never get the blame.” The piece alludes to an allegation commonly promoted on conservative-oriented sites, but it does not provide evidence to support references to deaths caused by former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>Another August 2018 article, titled, “American Couple Biked Through ISIS Territory To Prove Evil Doesn’t Exist — They Were Killed!” used a Daily Wire story as its source. However, NewsGuard could not find evidence that the couple discussed in the piece knowingly biked through a dangerous region or that they intended to “prove evil doesn’t exist.” Rather, the story distorts what one of the cyclists posted on his blog.</p>\n<p>Following NewsGuard’s inquiry about the piece, Dupree added “[UPDATED]” to the headline along with a note at the top of the article saying, “UPDATE: The story that I pulled this information was the Daily Wire which noted the biker couple had tried to prove that ISIS was evil. I have not been able to substantiate that claim so I am alert you the reader know (sic).” Dupree added similar updates to some, but not all, of the articles NewsGuard identified on WayneDupree.com as presenting unsubstantiated information.</p>\n<p>Between 2012 and 2013, WayneDupree.com published at least 10 articles about the Sandy Hook school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. In the first few, Dupree appears to acknowledge that the shooting occurred, including a December 2012 piece titled, “Sandy Hook Elementary School 26 Victims Names Released! Continue to Prayer for Grieving Families!” However, in some later pieces, Dupree speculates about whether the shooting was a conspiracy. For example, a January 2013 article was headlined, “Still Investigating: Actors in Sandy Hook hoax are identified.” When asked about these articles, Dupree told NewsGuard that he did not claim that the shooting was a hoax. “I didn’t say it didn’t happen, I was questioning based on articles I saw on other websites,” he said.</p>\n<p>Following NewsGuard’s inquiry about a corrections policy on WayneDupree.com in late August 2018, Dupree began adding a note at the bottom of articles telling readers to alert him about needed corrections using a contact form. Previously, Dupree told NewsGuard he would correct articles when notified by a reader who could provide evidence about why something was inaccurate. Dupree would then either delete the article or add an update to notify readers of the change, he said. However, because the corrections policy appears to be inconsistent, and because several articles found to include false information have not been corrected, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not currently have effective practices for issuing corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site has a biography of Dupree, and is clear about its conservative orientation. The site provides the names, titles, and social media handles for 19 contributors to the site, including two who are Dupree’s radio show co-hosts. However, the contributors listed no longer write for the site, Dupree said.</p>\n<p>Advertising is clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site was created in 2012 under the domain name NewsNinja2012, and Dupree changed the name to WayneDupree.com in 2015, he told NewsGuard.</p>\n<p>Dupree describes his political views as having shifted dramatically over the last several years. Dupree says he was a Democratic voter and supporter of Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign. “I got fed up because the media was taking a lot of things Hillary Clinton was saying and claiming something racist about it when describing Barack Obama,” Dupree, who is African-American, told NewsGuard. “I said, ‘I’m not going to be a part of this.’”</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nMacaela Bennett\n\nEdited by:\nEric Effron&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
