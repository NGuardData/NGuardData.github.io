In 2016, the nonprofit generated approximately $45 million in revenue and spent nearly $31 million, according to its government filings. Most revenue was earned through contributions and grants, as well as program services and investments.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Judicial Watch’s motto is “Because no one is above the law.” It describes itself as “a conservative, non-partisan educational foundation” that “promotes transparency, accountability and integrity in government, politics and the law.”</p>\n<p>A visitor to the site sees posts promoting Judicial Watch’s court cases most prominently. The site also publishes original reporting from a conservative perspective on its Corruption Chronicles blog and in its Investigative Bulletin series. In addition, it produces a weekly update highlighting the organization’s recent activity, posts government documents it has obtained, produces videos, and links to content on other news sites. Its reporting is often picked up by other conservative news sites.</p>\n<p>Judicial Watch organizes online petitions, for which it often runs advertisements on other websites, such as one to end illegal immigration and another to expose Republican and Democratic members of the “deep state.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Judicial Watch is widely regarded as a top government watchdog and has made a concerted effort to secure the release of documents from Republican and Democratic administrations. The organization’s work has led to the disclosure of records that otherwise may not have been made public. Norm Eisen, former Obama administration ethics czar and chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a left-leaning government watchdog, told Politico in an August 2018 article that he believes Judicial Watch has done “important work” on many issues.</p>\n<p>Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit in February 2018 against the Department of Justice for access to FBI documents related to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants regarding alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. The New York Times, USA Today, and Gizmodo also filed lawsuits in pursuit of these documents. When the documents were released in July 2018, they revealed that the FBI had detailed its reasons for believing that Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, was an agent of the Russian government.</p>\n<p>In 2015, Judicial Watch filed a federal lawsuit seeking access to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails that had been funneled through a private server at her home. Several other groups and news organizations sued for government records of Clinton’s tenure, before and during her presidential run in 2016. Thousands of Clinton emails were ultimately released to the public.</p>\n<p>After the Secret Service denied Judicial Watch’s request for White House visitor logs from the Obama administration, Judicial Watch filed a federal lawsuit in December 2009 to get them released. The Obama administration voluntarily began disclosing most visitor records in December 2009, in a settlement with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Judicial Watch, however, was seeking earlier records as well. In August 2011, a federal judge ordered the Obama administration to disclose the records Judicial Watch had requested, but the decision was overturned on appeal two years later.</p>\n<p>Judicial Watch filed a federal lawsuit in July 2001 against the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), which was established by President George W. Bush and led by Vice President Dick Cheney, requesting records of the task force’s meetings. The records contained information about the role energy executives played on the task force. Sierra Club, an environmentalist group, filed a similar suit six months later and the two cases were consolidated. Judicial Watch named Cheney, as well as several cabinet members and private individuals, in an amended complaint in February 2002. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2 in favor of Cheney and the NEPDG in June 2004. A separate lawsuit Judicial Watch filed against the Department of Commerce, however, resulted in the release of a map the task force developed in March 2001 of Iraq’s oil fields and lists of oil and gas projects in the country.</p>\n<p>These efforts notwithstanding, Judicial Watch has published false and distorted content on its Corruption Chronicles blog. NewsGuard found multiple instances in the past three years in which the site published false news without issuing corrections. It is for this reason that NewsGuard has determined that Judicial Watch does not gather and present information responsibly. </p>\n<p>In May 2017, Judicial Watch published a post claiming taxpayer money funded a billboard in Phoenix depicting President Donald Trump among Nazi-like imagery, which went up during the city-funded Art Detour festival. Beatrice Moore, owner of the billboard, told The Arizona Republic, which fact-checked the Judicial Watch post and found it to be false, that although the billboard went up during Art Detour, all the artwork featured on it was privately funded. The City of Phoenix also denied Judicial Watch’s claim. Art Detour event organizer Catrina Kahler told The Arizona Republic she had no prior knowledge of the installation.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard confirmed, in part using official documents that Judicial Watch published on its website, that although Moore founded a group that received funding during the event, she was no longer involved with the group at the time of the festival. Grand Avenue Arts &#x26; Preservation, a community arts group directed by Moore, received a city-funded grant for the 2016 Grand Avenue Festival, a separate event that occurred about four months before the billboard went up.</p>\n<p>Judicial Watch claimed in an April 2015 post that the Islamic State was operating an outpost in Mexico, about eight miles from El Paso, Texas. PolitiFact, a fact-checking website, determined this claim was false after representatives of the National Security Council, the FBI, the Texas Department of Public Safety, Mexico’s embassy in Washington, and the then associate director of the National Center for Border Security and Immigration at the University of Texas at El Paso could not validate or corroborate it.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard only found this report in one major media outlet -- the conservative-leaning Washington Times. Politifact’s findings were corroborated by reports on Fox News and KVIA-TV, an ABC affiliate in El Paso. Christopher Farrell, director of investigations and research at Judicial Watch, told Politifact the organization stands by its post.</p>\n<p>Judicial Watch claimed in a June 2016 post that relies almost entirely on anonymous sources that the Department of Homeland Security was secretly transporting undocumented immigrants to Phoenix from the Mexican border and releasing them, due to a lack of space in detention centers. The Department of Homeland Security denied that, fact-checking site Snopes reported. NewsGuard could not find reports of this story in any major media outlets, despite significant attention by the media to stories about the border and immigration.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard determined that Judicial Watch does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly because it regularly misstates or distorts facts in news stories to advance its agenda</p>\n<p>For example, a Judicial Watch press release and article posted on the site in July 2013 claimed Judicial Watch had obtained documents proving the Department of Justice had helped organize protests against George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot African-American teenager Trayvon Martin. Politifact, an independent fact-checking organization, judged the press release to be mostly false. It reported that the Department of Justice sent its Community Relations Service to help keep the situation from spiraling out of control, not to support the demonstrations or organize any protests. </p>\n<p>NewsGuard found Politifact’s report to be convincing. Community Relations Service documents detailing travel expenses, posted by Judicial Watch and reviewed by NewsGuard, state that the federal officials’ purpose was to provide “technical assistance” to event organizers, local officials, and law enforcement. Moreover, the Department of Justice website says the Community Relations Service “works with all parties” to facilitate “the development of viable, mutual understandings and solutions.”</p>\n<p>More recently, an August 2018 news story called linguist Noam Chomsky a “decrepit academic.” A June 2018 post was headlined “Urging Violence against Trump Cabinet Sinks Maxine Waters’ Scandal-Plagued Career to a New Low.” While Waters, a Democratic member of the U.S House of Representatives, did call on the public to personally confront Trump administration officials, she did not call for physical violence.</p>\n<p>JudicialWatch.org does not contain a corrections policy, and NewsGuard was only able to find two corrections made to Judicial Watch content, from 2013 and 2014.</p>\n<p>Jill Farrell, director of public affairs for Judicial Watch, would not initially respond to NewsGuard questions on its editorial standards and corrections policy, saying, “We are not going to participate. This review process seems designed to undermine our credibility and the credibility of other conservative and independent educational and news outlets.” </p>\n<p>Farrell later said, in reference to the story about the Department of Homeland Security, that Judicial Watch stands by its reporting. She added that as long as other media outlets use anonymous sources, Judicial Watch will too. She did not respond to questions about Judicial Watch’s editorial practices and lack of corrections. In response to the story on the anti-Trump billboard in Phoenix, Farrell said Judicial Watch “will not participate in a sham review process.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site includes full profiles for its board of directors and legal team, and lists the names and positions of its other staff members. It does not provide the contact information of individual employees, but lists general email addresses and phone numbers, as well as a press contact.</p>\n<p>The site, which does not carry advertising, is open about its conservative leanings. Judicial Watch does not make its 990 forms, which tax-exempt organizations file with the federal government, available on its website. The organization does not publicly disclose its donors, but as a nonpartisan, IRS-approved public charity, it is not required to do so.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Judicial Watch was founded in 1994 by Larry Klayman, a former federal prosecutor, who ran unsuccessfully as a Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Florida in 2003 after stepping down from his Judicial Watch role.</p>\n<p><em>Corrections: An earlier version of this label wrongly stated that President Trump had declassified certain documents related to the FBI investigation into Russian collusion in the 2016 presidential election. Trump had declassified a memo describing the documents, but not the documents themselves. The label also misstated the month that the Obama administration began releasing White House visitor logs; it was December. The label also gave the incorrect month of a Supreme Court ruling on Judicial Watch’s lawsuit regarding then Vice President Dick Cheney’s energy task force. It was decided in June 2004.</em> </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nMelissa Goldin\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Eric
