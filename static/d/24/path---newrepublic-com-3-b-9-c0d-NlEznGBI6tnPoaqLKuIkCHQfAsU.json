The publisher and editor-in-chief of Tin House literary magazine and Tin House Books, McCormack bought The New Republic in 2016 from Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, whose effort to transform the magazine into a “digital media company” in 2014 led to mass resignations of top editors. </p>\n<p>The site earns revenue from advertisements and digital subscriptions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The New Republic’s About page says, “For over 100 years, we have championed progressive ideas and challenged popular opinion. Our vision for today revitalizes our founding mission for our new time. … Today, The New Republic is the voice of creative thinkers, united by a collective desire to challenge the status quo.”</p>\n<p>The site produces in-depth, original reporting from around the world, with a focus on American politics and cultural issues. Text stories offer extensive analysis and are are often told in the first person, such as a September 2018 story titled “The Struggle for A New American Gospel; a liberal’s search for God and faith in a divided country.”</p>\n<p>The site has a Minutes section with short updates on breaking news, as well as sections on politics, culture, climate, books, and photography. Stories often present liberal points of view, although they reference multiple perspectives. For example, a September 2018 story on the difficulties women face running for governor argued in great detail why it is easier for them to win Congressional seats.</p>\n<p>Reviews of books and other arts coverage often include analyses of underlying social issues behind the creative work. A September 2018 article highlighted fallacies in a book that argued that Britain’s elite boarding schools shaped colonialism, and laid groundwork for the 2016 “Brexit” vote to withdraw the United Kingdom from the European Union. The photography section includes curated photo essays on both timely and historical issues. Features from 2018 included student activism by survivors of the Parkland High School mass shooting in Florida, and a series of subversive acts by modern Iranian women confronting their nation’s theocracy.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Political content is consistently liberal, in keeping with the publication’s stated mission. McCormack declared, upon assuming his role, a commitment to the magazine’s original calling as a voice for liberalism.  Headlines accurately reflect stories. Attribution in stories is common, and links to outside sources -- from other respected publications to government agency reports -- are frequently used.</p>\n<p>The New Republic fact checks all copy in the magazine, as well as all digital features. Ryan Kearney, the publication’s executive editor, said the staff includes four fact-checkers, known as reporter-researchers, who fact-check all the content in the print magazine, as well as online features. Kearney said designated editors for stories also fact-check daily content, and copy editors are instructed to flag factual errors.</p>\n<p>The New Republic does not publish letters to the editor online or in print, according to the site’s Contact page, which provides an email address for editorial feedback and corrections. Corrections are appended to the end of stories online, noting the original mistake and the correct information.</p>\n<p>The magazine has won several National Magazine Awards, most recently in 1995 for an extensive piece condemning the Clinton administration’s health care reform proposal. The story was written by Elizabeth McCaughey, who later served as New York’s lieutenant governor. The publication’s top editor, Andrew Sullivan, wrote in The Atlantic magazine in 2007 that he felt the article’s premise was flawed, but “nonetheless was comfortable running it as a provocation to debate.” New Republic was a finalist in 2018 for feature photography for a photo essay following racial violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and a finalist in 2015 for commentary.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Win McCormack is identified as editor-in-chief as well as publisher. He is also listed as chairman of Lake Avenue Publishing. The Masthead page lists more than two dozen staff editors and writers and their email addresses, along with more than a dozen contributing editors. A section called Press offers press releases summarizing each new issue and announces editorial management changes.</p>\n<p>All stories have an author’s name, with names linked to biographies, social media accounts and other recent New Republic stories they have written. Biographical information about freelance contributors is posted at the end of a piece, as is the case with staff writer biographies</p>\n<p>Advertising is clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The New Republic was originally funded by heiress and social activist Dorothy Payne Whitney Straight and was a strong advocate for globalism and entry into World War I. The magazine was regarded through the late 1960s as an arbiter of mainstream American liberalism. Its early contributors include writers such as W.E.B. DuBois, George Orwell, Virginia Woolf, and William Faulkner.</p>\n<p>It was bought in 1974 by Martin Peretz, a lecturer in social studies at Harvard. Peretz brought some elements of conservatism to its coverage, most notably an unwavering support of Israel that -- although he believed fervently in the importance of a secular state -- enraged many liberals who felt his opinions were anti-Muslim.</p>\n<p>The magazine remained prominent for many years under editors that included Michael Kinsley, who later founded Slate magazine, and Hendrik Hertzberg. Although Kinsley and Hertzberg generally hewed to liberal values, The New Republic was considered a “must read” across the political spectrum -- earning the admiration of some Republican leaders and intellectuals while demanding attention from Democrats with a thorough presentation of their opponents’ strategies. The magazine’s stature also grew with the 1982 hiring of Leon Wieseltier as editor of an expanded culture section. Wieseltier’s reinvention of The New Republic’s “back of the book” included the addition of extended critical essays about new books instead of shorter, more traditional reviews.</p>\n<p>The magazine became more conservative under the early-1990s editorship of British writer Andrew Sullivan. The magazine published pieces supportive ot the Gulf War, a position at odds with many American liberals, and also criticized Democratic President Bill Clinton for not working sufficiently  to stop the 1995 Serbian Army massacre of more than 8,000 Bosnians in Srebrenica.</p>\n<p>In 1994, several staffers objected to the magazine’s controversial decision to publish an excerpt of “The Bell Curve,” in which authors Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein argued that genetic differences between blacks and whites accounted for overall differences in IQ. The magazine also published several staffers’ responses and those of social scientists who disagreed with the article’s conclusions.</p>\n<p>The New Republic weathered two other high-profile editorial controversies in the 1990s. In 1998, feature writer Stephen Glass was found to have fabricated parts or all of 27 of the 41 stories he had written over the past three years. The fraud was the basis for a Vanity Fair magazine story that inspired the 2003 feature film “Shattered Glass.” In 1995, staff writer Ruth Shalit was fired after the magazine found that she had plagiarized parts of a 13,000-word piece about race relations in the Washington Post’s newsroom. </p>\n<p>The New Republic returned to consistently liberal roots. Franklin Foer assumed the editor post in 2006, and proclaimed that the magazine “was encouraging Democrats to dream big again on the environment and economics.” Beginning in 2007, Peretz sold and then bought back the magazine, finally selling it in 2012 to Facebook co-founder Hughes. </p>\n<p>Hughes presided over a redesign and editorial changes that prompted significant editorial turmoil and departures of more than 30 editors, including Foer and Wieseltier. The main editorial offices moved from Washington to New York, the much-read culture section was also curbed, a once-influential political column, “TRB,” was suspended, and the site reinstated a paywall for subscriber-only content. Hughes also cut the publication of the print magazine from 20 issues a year to 10. He sold the publication to McCormack in 2016.</p>\n<p>McCormack’s new publisher, Hamilton Fish, resigned in 2017 amid sexual harassment allegations by female staff and was replaced by Rachel Rosenfelt. The allegations against Fish came to light shortly after Wieseltier, by then retired, admitted to similar offenses toward female colleagues during his 31-year tenure.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written
