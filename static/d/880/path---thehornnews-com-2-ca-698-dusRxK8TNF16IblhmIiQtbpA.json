NewMarket Group, also known as NewMarket Health, states on its website that it is a “publishing and supplement company.” It runs health news websites including Health Sciences Institute and Healthier Talk, as well as health supplement businesses that include BestHealth Nutritionals and NorthStar Nutritionals.</p>\n<p>The Horn News does not provide a mailing address, only listing a P.O. Box in Frederick, Maryland, on its Terms &#x26; Conditions page. </p>\n<p>The Horn News runs advertisements on its website and in an emailed newsletter.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The website is focused on U.S. politics, although it also publishes breaking national, international and business news from other news sources. Its About Us page says, “The Horn News is direct, honest, conservative — and often outspoken. But we’re never dull, and we’re not afraid to take on the mainstream media’s ‘fake news’ spin.”</p>\n<p>Political stories often praise President Donald Trump or condemn liberals and the news media. Typical stories include “Ugly Kavanaugh HYPOCRISY exposed (liberals hate this),” referencing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and “Crazytown! You won’t BELIEVE who’s taking over D.C.” That story, following the November 2018 midterm elections, began, “Tuesday’s midterms gave the Democrats control of the House of Representatives, and now they’re lining up a leadership team of extremists, unhinged ideologues, and loons.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Horn News’ original stories generally package the author’s commentary around other organizations’ accounts of breaking news. The Horn News uses some credible sources, including USA Today and major television networks, as well as conspiracy sites that publish false content, such as The Gateway Pundit and True Pundit. The site also republishes news stories from The Associated Press without clearly crediting the AP. For example, a 23-paragraph story in November 2018 titled “First legal marijuana store opens on the East Coast,” copies every word of an AP article from Massachusetts, except for the headline. Other stories on a California mass shooting and U.S. meetings in North Korea are also republished AP stories. The site only adds “The Associated Press contributed to the report,” at the end of stories.</p>\n<p>Over the past two years, The Horn News has repeatedly published baseless conspiracy theories, predominantly about former president Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A December 2017 Horn News article that referred to a report on the political aspirations of the Clintons’ daughter, Chelsea, said, “Like the hundreds of body bags surrounding the Clinton family, the timing is too perfect to be a complete coincidence.” A post on the fact-checking website Snopes published in 1998 looked at roughly 50 deaths that were alleged to be connected to the Clintons, rating all of them false.</p>\n<p>In November 2017, the site ran a poll asking, “Do you believe Hillary Clinton ordered Seth Rich's murder?” The poll referred to Democratic National Committee staff member Seth Rich’s 2016 shooting death, which police have attributed to a botched robbery. However, conservative and conspiracy news sites have suggested that Rich was killed after leaking DNC emails to WikiLeaks, which publishes troves of confidential documents. The Horn News’ poll ran under a story that said, “Ever since Rich was gunned down on July 10, 2016, rumors have swirled that he was a victim of the Clinton family’s unscrupulous lust for power.” Rich’s parents have called theories connecting their son to WikiLeaks “baseless” and said investigators looked at Rich’s personal computer and personal email and did not find any communications with WikiLeaks. </p>\n<p>The website’s stories on the Clintons have not been deleted or corrected. NewsGuard could find no evidence of corrections posted on the site.</p>\n<p>The Horn News also suggested in a June 2018 post that TV host Anthony Bourdain’s death, which authorities ruled was a suicide, was connected to his criticism of Hillary Clinton. Although The Horn News noted that fact-checking website Snopes called the claim false and said “it seems unlikely” Bourdain was killed over his comments, the story continued, “There remains no credible evidence that Bourdain’s tragic suicide was connected to Hillary. Not yet, at least…” </p>\n<p>The website has also published speculative stories on other topics, suggesting in October 2018 that witnesses to unexplained lights in the sky near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, “are raising questions about where they came from -- and if they could possibly be from another planet.” The site shared a YouTube video that came from an unreliable UFO conspiracy site.</p>\n<p>The Horn News’ repeated promotion of debunked conspiracy theories to advance conservative opinions, as well as its use of questionable news sources and failure to credit others, has caused NewsGuard to determine that it does not gather and present information responsibly, or handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. Its failure to correct false information implicating the Clinton family in dozens of deaths has also prompted NewsGuard to determine the site repeatedly publishes false content.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard sent two emails to the site seeking comment about The Horn News’ editorial practices, including its lack of corrections and publication of conspiracy theories. It did not receive a response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The About Us page identifies and provides brief background information about the site’s associate publisher, news editor, and contributors. Some posts have clear bylines identifying authors, but many are attributed to the site’s editorial team or have no byline. Photos regularly appear without attribution.</p>\n<p>TheHornNews.com does not clearly disclose its ownership by NewMarket Group LLC, except on the site’s Terms &#x26; Conditions page.</p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored links are clearly distinguished from news content.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard sent two emails to The Horn News’ customer service address and to its editorial address, seeking comment about its failure to clearly disclose its owner and provide information about content creators. The emails were not returned.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Horn News was launched in 2015.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSam Howard\n\nEdited by:\nSarah Brandt&#x26;emsp;Amy
