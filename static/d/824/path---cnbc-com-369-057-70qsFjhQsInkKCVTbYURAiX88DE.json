CNBC.com runs ads and branded content. It also offers a subscription service called CNBC Pro, which provides market data, analysis, and video.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>CNBC.com provides up-to-date coverage of the business world and financial markets, including analysis and commentary. The site’s staff often publishes short stories immediately after news breaks. Other stories are lengthy and offer in-depth reporting. The site publishes bullet points that summarize stories just below the headlines.</p>\n<p>Many stories are written from the perspective of how the events described will affect the stock market. If publicly traded companies are named in a story, the site provides links to a CNBC page with the latest information about the company’s stock performance. The site features a portal that provides data on domestic and international markets, as well as the companies listed on them. Some data is provided by Thomson Reuters.</p>\n<p>CNBC.com publishes financial and investing advice, sometimes from professional financial advisers.</p>\n<p>The site’s content is grouped under pages listed at the top of the home page, including Business News, Markets, Investing, Tech, and CNBC TV, which provides clips of CNBC shows, including the popular “Mad Money” investment advice show, hosted by Jim Cramer. The site’s home page also links to a section titled Make It, which is a personal finance and career advice page for young professionals.</p>\n<p>CNBC.com also allows cable subscribers to stream the CNBC cable channel live on the site.</p>\n<p>CNBC.com publishes video from the CNBC channel, and often publishes stories of the network’s on-air interviews with executives, analysts, and politicians. CNBC also publishes content from The Associated Press, Reuters, and USA Today.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>CNBC has bureaus on several continents. CNBC.com writers cite sources, reach out to subjects of stories for comment, and include quotes from outside experts to provide context. The site’s contributors typically write in an objective, neutral style. The site runs corrections and features a link to all its corrections that runs at the bottom of every page. </p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the 2008 market collapse, The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart criticized CNBC and host Jim Cramer for failing to accurately report the conditions that led to the Great Recession. Cramer, appearing on The Daily Show before a skeptical studio audience, acknowledged the shortcomings. “Absolutely we could do better. Absolutely. There are shenanigans, and we should call them out,” Cramer said. “Everyone should. I should do a better job at it.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Stories on CNBC.com carry bylines, which often run next to author Twitter handles. Bylines link to short biographies. Authors usually have email addresses in their Twitter bios, but a CNBC press contact confirmed there is no way to contact reporters directly on the site. CNBC.com does not provide a public list of its editors and reporters. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>CNBC launched in 1989. In 2018, President Donald Trump tapped former CNBC contributor Larry Kudlow to lead his National Economic Council. MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews and personal finance guru Suze Orman both previously worked for the network.</p>\n<p><em>Disclosure: CNBC host Jim Cramer is a longtime friend and former colleague of NewsGuard co-CEO Steven Brill.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJosh Keefe\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com/about/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nbcuniversal.com/business/cnbc\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nbcuniversal.com/business/cnbc</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cmcsa.com/financials\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cmcsa.com/financials</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cmcsa.com/financials\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cmcsa.com/financials</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/advertising-and-partnerships/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com/advertising-and-partnerships/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/business/media/12cnbc.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/business/media/12cnbc.html</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/08/rupertmurdoch.newscorporation\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/08/rupertmurdoch.newscorporation</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/26/toys-r-us-built-a-kingdom-and-the-worlds-biggest-toy-store-then-they-lost-it.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/26/toys-r-us-built-a-kingdom-and-the-worlds-biggest-toy-store-then-they-lost-it.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/26/ge-ceo-john-flannery-im-very-comfortable-now-with-whats-going-on-in.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/26/ge-ceo-john-flannery-im-very-comfortable-now-with-whats-going-on-in.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nbcuniversal.com/press-release/cnbc-make-it-and-bustle-partner-co-production-digital-video-series-%E2%80%9Cyoung-money%E2%80%9D\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nbcuniversal.com/press-release/cnbc-make-it-and-bustle-partner-co-production-digital-video-series-%E2%80%9Cyoung-money%E2%80%9D</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/make-it/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com/make-it/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/28/cnbcs-really-bad-debate-night/?utm_term=.2bdfa207997d\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/28/cnbcs-really-bad-debate-night/?utm_term=.2bdfa207997d</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/29/cnbc-moderators-debate-performance.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/29/cnbc-moderators-debate-performance.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/opinion/joe-nocera-on-the-cramer-takedown.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/opinion/joe-nocera-on-the-cramer-takedown.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2009/03/the_extended_uncut_daily_show.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2009/03/the<em>extended</em>uncut<em>daily</em>show.html</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cc.com/video-clips/uc9y5b/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-cnbc-financial-advice\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cc.com/video-clips/uc9y5b/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-cnbc-financial-advice</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/corrections/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com/corrections/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://time.com/5197983/larry-kudlow-replace-gary-cohn-what-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">http://time.com/5197983/larry-kudlow-replace-gary-cohn-what-to-know/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/27/business/the-media-business-new-cnbc-president.htmlCN\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/27/business/the-media-business-new-cnbc-president.htmlCN</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/04/17/this-is-cnbc-first-ever-broadcast-from-april-17-1989.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/04/17/this-is-cnbc-first-ever-broadcast-from-april-17-1989.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"cnbc.com","author":"Josh Keefe","date":"2018-08-30T19:31:40.428+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/cnbc.com/"}}
