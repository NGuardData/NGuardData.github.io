The Politics section includes “The Buzz,” a blog about Florida politics, and a link to PolitiFact, the national political fact-checking organization. Opinion includes Letters to the Editor and pieces from the paper’s six columnists.

In 2018, direct ownership of PolitiFact transferred from the newspaper to the Poynter Institute for Media Studies.</p>\n<p>The newspaper regularly endorses candidates in local and national political races.

A “Standard of Accuracy” states that it aims to “get it right the first time,” and offers a number of ways to contact the editorial team if readers want to recommend corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>All articles clearly name the writer, linking to background and contact information. The Contact Us page lists the names and contact information for different departments, as well as editorial and leadership staff.</p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored content are clearly labeled. Images are clearly attributed.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Tampa Bay Times dates to 1884, when the first issues of a weekly Florida paper, the West Hillsborough Times, were published. The paper moved to St. Petersburg in 1892, and was bought in 1912 by Indiana publisher Paul Poynter. By the 1920s, the Times began publishing seven days a week. Poynter’s son, Nelson, ran the paper for four decades. When he died in 1978, he willed most of his stock to what is now the Poynter Institute, a private, nonprofit journalism training and research organization.</p>\n<p>Tampabay.com was registered in 1995. In 2012, the paper changed its name from the St. Petersburg Times to the Tampa Bay Times. In 2016, it acquired the more conservative Tampa Tribune.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nAnne van Binsbergen\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://company.tampabay.com:2052/about-us/times-history\" target=\"_blank\">http://company.tampabay.com:2052/about-us/times-history</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/topics/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tampabay.com/topics/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/universal/standard_of_accur.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tampabay.com/universal/standard<em>of</em>accur.shtml</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://company.tampabay.com:2052/about-us/awards\" target=\"_blank\">http://company.tampabay.com:2052/about-us/awards</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/search/tampa%2520bay%2520times\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/search/tampa%2520bay%2520times</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/writers/?plid=malena-carollo\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tampabay.com/writers/?plid=malena-carollo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/realestate/Report-40-percent-of-Florida-property-will-be-highly-exposed-to-flooding-_169254238\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/realestate/Report-40-percent-of-Florida-property-will-be-highly-exposed-to-flooding-_169254238</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/For-Florida-Governor-the-Times-recommends-_170581106\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/For-Florida-Governor-the-Times-recommends-_170581106</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.politifactbias.com/2014/07/the-tampa-bay-times-endorsed-mitt-romney.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politifactbias.com/2014/07/the-tampa-bay-times-endorsed-mitt-romney.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/267351-bush-picks-up-tampa-bay-times-endorsement\" target=\"_blank\">http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/267351-bush-picks-up-tampa-bay-times-endorsement</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/All-the-Times-candidate-recommendations-in-one-place_170451295\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/All-the-Times-candidate-recommendations-in-one-place_170451295</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://company.tampabay.com:2052/contact-us\" target=\"_blank\">http://company.tampabay.com:2052/contact-us</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/channels/fact-checking\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.poynter.org/channels/fact-checking</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/about-us/history\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.poynter.org/about-us/history</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=www.tampabay.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=www.tampabay.com </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://company.tampabay.com:2052/company/about-us/times-history\" target=\"_blank\">http://company.tampabay.com:2052/company/about-us/times-history</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"tampabay.com","author":"Anne van Binsbergen","date":"2018-09-12T19:05:54.422+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tampabay.com/"}}
