Articles on the site link to The Duran’s PayPal account and to its page on crowdfunding website Patreon. A separate page on the site solicits investors for DRN Media PLC. The site also publishes advertisements and links to an online shop that markets Duran-branded apparel, often emblazoned with tongue-in-cheek slogans poking fun at those who criticize Russia, including T-shirts that say “Putin Stooge” and “Russian Bot.”</p>\n<p>The site’s editor-in-chief, Alexander Mercouris, was formerly a lawyer in England until he was disbarred in 2012 following his pattern of “conduct likely to diminish public confidence in the legal profession or the administration of justice or otherwise bring the legal profession into disrepute,” according to the Bar Standards Board in the U.K and reports in the British newspaper The Telegraph. The Telegraph reported in 2012 that Mercouris lied and falsely accused the president of the U.K. Supreme Court of having him kidnapped. </p>\n<p>The site’s director, Peter Lavelle, hosts CrossTalk, the flagship program on RT, a television network funded by the Russian government.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>A profile for The Duran on crowdfunding website Patreon says the website is “a conservative news-media platform that advances a realpolitik position, and traditional cultural and social values,” but also that the site is “not right, left or center.” No description of The Duran’s mission appears on the site.</p>\n<p>The Duran’s content primarily covers Russian and U.S. politics and other global affairs that affect the two countries. The site’s news content is generally told from a pro-Russia perspective, often pointing out perceived flaws and weaknesses of Western nations and organizations, including the U.S., the European Union, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Stories specifically about U.S. politics, however, support conservative and Republican views.</p>\n<p>The Duran rarely, if ever, conducts its own reporting. Writers either copy and paste sizable passages of other news outlets’ stories and add the writer’s commentary, or print full stories by other sites, including Fox News and Kremlin site RT.com.</p>\n<p>Typical stories on the site include “50,000 NATO Troops Stage MASSIVE Military Drills on Russia’s Border,” “The Dangerous and Irrational Attack on Brett Kavanaugh,” “‘Swift And Severe’: Trump Administration Readies Its Best Hackers For Cyberattack Against Russia,” and   “SORE LOSER Democrats try to bolster FAILED RussiaGate narrative – by SUING Trump and Russia!” The latter article referred to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election.  “Democrats,” the article said, “are acting like a bunch of spoiled-brat druggies, trying to get their way when the whole world has spoken against them.”</p>\n<p>The site also contains a Lifestyle section, which includes stories about business, arts and entertainment, although it is sporadically updated.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Duran has published false information and conspiracy theories concerning Russian figures and leading Democrats. The Duran published a series of articles in 2018 that referred to the March 2018 poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter as a “hoax.” That claim contradicts the conclusions of the U.K.’s Crown Prosecution Service, which asserted that Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent, and charged two Russian nationals in the attempted killings.</p>\n<p>Another Duran post on Skripal said, “NATO plotted ‘Skripal Case’ to justify military massive spending,” but the story itself did not provide any concrete evidence to support a plot by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. </p>\n<p>Another post, written by The Duran’s president in April 2018, ran with a headline claiming Skripal’s poisoning case “leads right to Hillary Clinton and the DNC,” citing an article in The Telegraph that linked Skripal to a security consultant who worked for Christopher Steele, the former spy who compiled a dossier making claims about President Donald Trump’s involvement with Russia. The Telegraph report made no mention of Clinton or the Democratic National Committee.</p>\n<p>The same article then renewed an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory alleging that Bill and Hillary Clinton are linked to a number of suspicious deaths, “All of this begs the question,” the piece said, “was Skripal the latest victim of the Clinton mafia’s murder machine?” In a piece published in 1998, fact-checking website Snopes examined approximately 50 deaths of people that different publications had linked to Bill Clinton, determining all of the claims were false.</p>\n<p>Other posts distort facts or make unsubstantiated conclusions. A September 2018 post referenced a Wall Street Journal article that cited unnamed U.S. officials as saying that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was preparing to use chemicals in Syria’s Civil War. The Duran post, called the Journal article “the epitome of fake news,” saying Assad would not use chemical weapons for fear of a retaliatory strike by the U.S. It listed a number of reasons why news consumers should not trust unnamed sources in reports, including that the sources offer anti-Russian sentiments.</p>\n<p>The article on Assad was labeled as news. The website labels some content as “analysis” posts, but others labeled as news contain opinionated content. The site’s news stories, for example, often refer to Hillary Clinton as “Crooked Hillary,” using a nickname popularized by Donald Trump. </p>\n<p>The site frequently published U.S. and European accounts from the sites RT.com and ZeroHedge.com, two sites that NewsGuard has determined publish false content and conspiracy theories.</p>\n<p>The Duran’s repeated publication of false information and conspiracy theories about the Skripal poisoning and Bill and Hillary Clinton, without correction, as well as its frequent use of content from pro-Russia sites such as RT.com and ZeroHedge.com, has led NewsGuard to determine it repeatedly publishes false content and does not gather and present information responsibly. Its political opinions expressed in news stories demonstrate that it also does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>After The Duran was contacted by a fact-checker for conservative news website The Weekly Standard, it published a correction to an April 2018 story that incorrectly gave the impression that the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons determined there was no recent evidence of chemical weapons at a site in Damascus, Syria. Although a correction note was attached to the story, the inaccurate information remained in the original article. In September 2018, The Duran wrote that “some textual corrections” were made to a separate story, without indicating what those edits were. Because the only recent corrections to the site either did not explain the correction or kept inaccurate information online, NewsGuard has determined that The Duran does not regularly correct and clarify errors.</p>\n<p>The Duran did not reply to two emails sent to an editor’s email address, seeking comment about its publication of false information and conspiracy theories, use of questionable news sources and opinion in news stories, and lack of corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>A Contact Us page provides five email addresses to reach the site’s different departments, including one email for the site’s editorial leadership. Users can find authors’ bylines, but th sites does not include the authors’ biographical or contact information.</p>\n<p>Although Mercouris and Lavelle’s leadership positions are identified on their author pages, the website does not centrally name those in charge. The website also does not provide information about its ownership in a place where users can easily find it. Ownership is listed in a small-print copyright disclosure and in links such as its privacy policy. The Duran also does not identify who funds it.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are clearly distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<p>The Duran did not reply to two emails NewsGuard sent to the site seeking comment on its lack of information about its owner, top management,content creators, and financing.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>TheDuran.com domain name was registered in 2016.
