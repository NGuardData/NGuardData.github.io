TheBlaze Inc. was founded by conservative political commentator Glenn Beck, which he owned through its parent company, Mercury Radio Arts, a private, Texas-based media production company. CRTV was founded by conservative commentator Mark Levin, who hosts a Fox News opinion program called Life, Liberty &#x26; Levin. The ownership structure of the new Blaze Media company is not publicly known. The company generates revenue through advertisements and subscription fees for its video content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>TheBlaze publishes U.S. and global news and opinion articles, podcasts, clips, video programming, and radio programming across its website and video platform,  BlazeTV.</p>\n<p>The site’s About section links to the About page of BlazeTV’s website, which states that “BlazeTV is your source for the most thought-provoking personalities and conservative ideas that are not available from traditional media outlets.”</p>\n<p>The site’s News section contains straightforward reports, such as “General Motors to lay off 4,000 workers in North America.” Its political coverage often reflects a conservative point of view, with headlines such as “WATCH: This line from Trump's SOTU address had even Democrats chanting 'USA!'” and “Rachel Maddow accused of misleading viewers over Trump Jr.’s blocked phone call reports.” The site’s Radio, Podcasts, and BlazeTV sections house dozens of conservative opinion programs, including Levin’s LevinTV video segment, Steven Crowder’s Louder With Crowder video show, and Beck’s radio show, The Glenn Beck Program.</p>\n<p>Many stories use reporting sourced from other news organizations or exchanges made on social media, although some articles feature original interviews conducted by TheBlaze.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles are generally fact-based, generally citing and linking to reports from established media organizations including The Hill and ABC News. Stories often quote authoritative sources, such as federal officials and subject-matter experts. Headlines are generally straightforward and representative of content.</p>\n<p>TheBlaze issues corrections, often in the form of an editor’s note explaining the change. In instances in which a story itself is found to be false, TheBlaze has removed the article and posted an update explaining the retraction.</p>\n<p>TheBlaze distinguishes news coverage from opinion content by labeling stories either “news” or “op-ed,” and by including the word “commentary” in the headlines of opinion pieces. Although the site’s commentary programs, such as Beck’s, are not explicitly labeled “opinion,” the distinction is implied, and such content is not labeled “news.”</p>\n<p>However, some stories labeled “news” contains opinion without being described as such. For example, a February 2019 article, “If you thought abortion bills in New York, Virginia were bad, just wait until you see Vermont's,” described the bill as “Unimaginable evil” in its subheading. Another February 2019 news article was headlined “Bloodthirsty left-wing Twitter mob strikes again — and this time, an Asian immigrant author is the victim.” The article refers to “yet another ‘pile-on’ by a posse within the bloodthirsty Twitter mob.”</p>\n<p>Because these and other opinion stories are labeled “news” and reside in the site’s news section, NewsGuard has concluded TheBlaze does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>In an email to NewsGuard, TheBlaze Managing Editor Leon Wolf said that “The tone of our coverage will certainly be different from what you would expect to find at Slate or MSNBC or Huffington Post. Sometimes we will have some editorial commentary in our copy or headlines. I do not think it is worse or more egregious than many other sites….”  Wolf added that the site would start categorizing its commentary pieces as “Op-Eds” with more consistency.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>A Staff link on the bottom of the site directs to the site’s Masthead, which was added after a discussion with NewsGuard. The page names and provides email addresses for the site’s editors and staff writers, including Wolf, the managing editor.</p>\n<p>Articles often contain the name of the writer, usually linking to a page with the author’s photo, contact information, a short biography, and other stories.</p>\n<p>Display advertisements are distinguishable from editorial content, and sponsored content is clearly labeled. TheBlaze changed its labeling of one advertorial section, previously dubbed “Worth a Look,” to “Sponsored content,” after a discussion with NewsGuard.</p>\n<p>The site does not provide any information about its ownership or financing. Asked about the site’s lack of ownership information, Wolf said in an phone call with NewsGuard that he would discuss the issue with the company’s CEO.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Glenn Beck launched the site in 2010. Several rounds of layoffs and office closures, starting in 2016, have shrunk the company, which once employed around 300 people, to a staff size of fewer than 50 people. In December 2018, TheBlaze merged with CRTV, forming Blaze Media.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: After an earlier version of this Nutrition Label was published, TheBlaze added a masthead and improved its labeling of sponsored content on the site. NewsGuard has therefore determined that the site now meets its standards for revealing who is in charge and for clearly labeling </em><em>advertising</em><em>. Also, after further review, NewsGuard has determined that the site regularly corrects errors, avoids deceptive headlines, and provides information about content creators.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://mercuryradioarts.com/#testimonials\"
