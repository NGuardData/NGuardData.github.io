{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<div class=\"right-score\">Score: 62</div>\n<h1>thepetitionsite.com&emsp; <span class=\"net-country\">(WEB - en-US)</span></h1>\n<p>A platform for people to launch and sign petitions. The site says more than 804 million signatures have been collected since it was established in 1998.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<p>Care2, Inc. owns and operates thepetitionsite.com and companion website Care2services.com. Randy Paynter, co-founder of the electronic greeting card service eCards.com, is Care2’s founder, CEO, and president. The company is headquartered in Redwood City, California.</p>\n<p>Care2 generates revenue through what is known as “permission-based marketing,” a form of advertising in which target audiences -- in this case, those using The Petition Site -- agree to receive promotional information from organizations that they are interested in. (Sister site Care2services.com is a how-to website for those organizations, primarily nonprofits, that seek to expand their audiences, influence, and donor bases.) </p>\n<p>Care2 essentially functions as a middleman between its clients, which have included organizations such as the United Nations Foundation and the American Red Cross, and users on The Petition Site. According to Care2 Services, the company’s clients pay approximately $1.50 to $2 for the email address of each new supporter they recruit. “Supporters” are people who have registered on The Petition Site and, when signing a petition, agree to receive alerts or newsletters from the organization that created the petition. </p>\n<p>According to Care2services.com, Care2 has worked with over 1,500 organizations, including Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Foundation Amnesty International, and The Humane Society of the United States. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Thepetitionsite.com is not a news site, but rather, a platform that virtually anyone can use to start a petition, although petitions overwhelmingly favor liberal or environmentalist causes. That is something the site encourages by stating, at the bottom of the site, that it opposes “bigots, bullies, science deniers, misogynists, gun lobbyists, xenophobes, the willfully ignorant, animal abusers, frackers, and other mean people.”</p>\n<p>Petitions are organized into categories that reflect their causes, from the environment to corporate accountability to the rights of women, children, and animals. Each petition sets a goal for signatures and shows how many people have signed. </p>\n<p>One undated petition seeks sanctions against the Ugandan government “to force them to stop torturing and murdering people.” Another petition calls on Somalia’s attorney general to prosecute those who practice female-genital mutilation. Another asks for signatures to fire a Florida high school teacher who allegedly “took students out of class and showed them how to forcibly drown two helpless raccoons.”     </p>\n<p>Popular petitions have included demands for first lady Melania Trump to deal with cyberbullying more effectively and for former Trump aide Omarosa Manigault Newman to turn over secretly recorded tapes she said she had to special counsel Robert Mueller.</p>\n<p>The Petition Site also offers webinars and video training from “Care2 Activist University,” a free program to “help you transform the world and inspire action for the causes you care about.” One webinar topic was “Trump Resistance Training: Defending the Environment.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Petitions are undated and often do not attribute information to a source, placing the responsibility for verification on the signer. While many petitions are grounded in fact, others contain false or unverifiable claims. One petition demanded the prosecution of then-President-elect Trump on allegations of treason against the government. The author stated, inaccurately, that “it has been found that President-elect Donald Trump colluded with President Vladimir Putin of Russia to hack our government records and electoral system.” The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, but the question of Trump campaign collusion with the Russians was still under investigation and unresolved. </p>\n<p>Some petitions have promoted outlandish causes. Examples include an undated petition about stopping “the extinction of Africanoid Species.” The author demanded “treatment, healing and correction” for “endangered Africanoid species,” and stated that a study of certain human proteins has revealed a mutation in DNA resulting in “slave babies.” Other petitions have advocated for the “rights of zombies” or explained why vegans will survive a zombie-apocalypse. As of October 2018, those petitions were closed to new signatures but could still be viewed on the site.</p>\n<p>Asked about Care2’s editorial oversight and how it ensures information is gathered from reliable sources, Paynter said that petitions created by users of the site are screened “by machine” for violations of Care2’s terms of service, which bar the posting of threatening or abusive language, pyramid schemes, and copyright violations. </p>\n<p>Paynter also said that because petitions are visible on the site, members can flag problematic ones. Paynter said staff members review petitions that are “gathering momentum” and will remove any that are clearly inaccurate or contradict the site’s mission. </p>\n<p>He noted that the petitions mentioned above regarding Trump-Russia collusion and the “extinction of Africanoid Species” appear “to have been shut down early” -- meaning people could no longer sign them. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Anyone registering on The Petition Site to create or sign a petition must supply their name, address, and email. But petition authors are not required to use their real names on the site. </p>\n<p>Care2.com names and provides biographical information about its executives and senior staff. Petitions are attributed to the “Care2 Team,” organizations, or groups, but often not to named individuals. “If we did that, a lot of important issues would never see the light of day,” Paynter said.</p>\n<p>When registering to sign or create a petition on The Petition Site, users are not clearly informed how Care2 may use the information they provide. During the “final step” of the signup process, new users are offered free newsletters providing information about other Care2 petitions and Care2 efforts, which offer “fact-based insights about newsworthy causes delivered daily to your inbox.” Care2 does not inform members that by choosing to receive these newsletters, their email addresses can be sold to other companies and organizations, or that they will receive solicitations for donations. </p>\n<p>Asked why users are not informed about how their data could be used, Paynter said: “We've never heard anyone question that, as we do try to make sure everyone knows Care2 is the provider of petitions and a variety of other services.”</p>\n<p>The site does not run advertisements or sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Paynter co-founded electronic greeting card service eCards.com in 1995, which he later sold, and launched Care-Mail, an email service that provided users with wildlife-inspired vanity email addresses.That was Paynter’s first attempt at building “an online network of socially conscious people,” he wrote in a post on the publishing platform Medium. With Care-Mail struggling to compete with Yahoo and Gmail, Paynter said, he rebranded the company as Care2 and changed the business model.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited
