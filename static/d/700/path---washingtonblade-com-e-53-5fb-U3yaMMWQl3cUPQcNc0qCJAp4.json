Brown, Naff, Pitts and the former Blade staff published a paper named DC Agenda from 2009 until they acquired rights to the Washington Blade brand in 2010. DC Agenda then was renamed the Washington Blade.</p>\n<p>The site runs advertisements, and sells copies of the paper’s print editions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Washington Blade’s tagline is “America’s LGBT News Source.” The site’s content sections include Politics, Local, National, Opinions, Lifestyle, Health, and Sports. Typical headlines on the site include “Exclusive: Kennedy, Markey seek to ban anti-LGBT panic defense in court,” “Soccer game street closing blocks access to gay nightclub,” “Delaware guv fails to issue Pride proclamation, triggering backlash,” and “Cuban bars use right of admission to throw out LGBTI+ people.”</p>\n<p>The Blade features local news for the gay, lesbian and transgender communities in Maryland, Virginia and Delaware, in addition to the District of Columbia. It also features food and entertainment news for the area, as well as a “Best of Gay DC” awards section.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Blade’s staff publishes originally reported, well-researched articles, supported by interviews with experts, public figures and authoritative explanations of court rulings and their impact on the LGBT community. While the site’s stories focus solely on issues relevant to the gay community, as its tagline reflects, news stories are consistently balanced in their tone and do not include extraneous opinions. The site does post commentary in a separate opinion section.</p>\n<p>The Blade regularly receives accolades from the Society of Professional Journalists’ D.C. chapter, including six awards in 2018. Three of the wins were awarded for the Blade’s coverage of protests at the Capital Pride parade, including for breaking news, photography, and for editorial/opinion writing.</p>\n<p>The Blade does not have a stated corrections policy, and NewsGuard was unable to find an example of a correction. The site did not respond to two NewsGuard emails asking about its corrections policy.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Each article on washingtonblade.com names its author, features an author biography at the end of articles, and generally lists social media contact information.</p>\n<p>Advertisements on the Blade’s website are distinguishable from news content.</p>\n<p>The publication’s leadership and ownership are clearly disclosed on the site’s About page.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Washington Blade was founded in 1969, as a “black and white, one-sheet community newsletter distributed in D.C.-area bars,” according to a history posted on the site’s About Us page.</p>\n<p>The Blade’s name refers to a one-time euphemism for a gay man.  “By the 1960s... sometimes ‘gay blade’ was used interchangeably with phrases like ‘confirmed bachelor,’ as code for a gay man, generally in the closet,” according to the site’s About Us page.</p>\n<p>The Blade published an article in 1981 entitled “Rare, Fatal Pneumonia Hits Gay Men,” becoming one of the first gay newspapers in the U.S. to write about AIDS.</p>\n<p>The Blade shut down when its parent company filed for bankruptcy in November 2009, but the staff published a similar newspaper, named DC Agenda, later that year. The Blade began publishing under its original  name in 2010 after its current owners acquired the Blade’s assets in bankruptcy court.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBron Maher\n\nEdited
