David Mikkelson co-founded Snopes with his then-wife, Barbara Mikkelson. After the couple divorced in 2015, Barbara Mikkelson sold her stake in what was then Bardav Inc. to the shareholders of Proper Media Group, a former advertising vendor. The company is seeking to remove Mikkelson as company director; a lawsuit is pending in a California court. Snopes launched a GoFundMe campaign to finance the litigation, which has raised more than $800,000.</p>\n<p>Snopes says it is “almost entirely funded through programmatic digital advertising sales.” It also accepts contributions from readers and nonpartisan organizations, and solicits donations at the end of most articles and at the top of its site. “We work tirelessly to curb the spread of misinformation and fake news, and we couldn’t do it without you,” the appeal says. </p>\n<p>Snopes discloses all contributions worth more than $10,000. In 2017, it received $100,000 from Facebook as part of a fact-checking partnership to reduce the spread of false news on the social media platform. In 2016, it received $75,000 from the James Randi Educational Foundation as part of an annual award given to groups “providing unbiased, fact-based answers to confusing questions.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The majority of content Snopes publishes are articles that fact-check specific claims, quotes, statistics, memes, and photos.</p>\n<p>Snopes’ fact-check format states the initial claim, followed by a rating of either “True,” “Mostly True,” “Mixture,” “Mostly False,” “False,” “Unproven,” “Outdated,” “Miscaptioned,” “Correct Attribution,” “Misattributed,” “Scam” and “Legend.”  The rating is followed by a section called Origin, which describes where the claim came from and often details the steps that Snope took to verify or debunk the claim.</p>\n<p>The site started by fact-checking urban legends and hoaxes, a practice it continues today. For example, the site gave a “False” rating in a May 2018 story titled “Did a Man from Zimbabwe Invent an Electric Car That Requires No Charging?” In July 2018, it gave a “True” rating to “Did an Obese Man Survive Without Eating for 382 Days?” Snopes also fact-checked viral memes and Facebook posts more than any other major fact-checking site in 2018, according to data compiled by Real Clear Politics’ Fact Check Review. </p>\n<p>While organizations like Politifact and The Associated Press frequently fact-check public officials’ claims, Snopes is more likely to evaluate viral claims and rumors, on politics and other topics. For example, “Did Democrats Draft Legislation That Would Make Eating at Chick-Fil-A a Hate Crime?” and “Did Melania Trump spell ‘HELP’ in a Tweet?” both earned “False” ratings in June 2018.</p>\n<p>Snopes also publishes news stories, which include both AP stories and other stories written in response to reader questions, rather than as a traditional fact check, David Mikkelson told NewsGuard.</p>\n<p>Snopes sometimes includes videos and photo evidence in its fact checks, which are often used to verify or refute written descriptions of events. The site also has a “Hot 50” section on its site listing its “Top Fact Checks,” as well as a “Most Searched” table of stories and corresponding links on the side of the home page. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Snopes has been verified by the International Fact Checkers Network, which is run by the Poynter Institute, a nonprofit media watchdog based St. Petersburg, Florida. Real Clear Politics’ Fact Check Review, which compiles data on fact-checking sites, found that of six major fact-checking sites, Snopes had the highest rate of fact-checking only provable facts, as opposed to opinions, as of August 2018.</p>\n<p>Snopes writers show their work. They describe how they decide on a rating, as well as the process they use to evaluate a claim, which includes showing readers the sources they used and the experts or subjects they sought for comment. However, they rarely seek comment from the sources of the stories or claims they are evaluating. This failure to adhere to basic journalistic standards would have led to a NewsGuard determination that the site does not gather and present information responsibly, if not for the site’s otherwise careful process. </p>\n<p>Mikkelson did not respond to an email and a voicemail seeking comment on Snopes’ failure to contact all sources of disputed claims.</p>\n<p>Snopes often debunks viral images by finding the source of the original, unaltered image. It also lists links to its sources at the bottom of every fact check.</p>\n<p>Snopes has a correction policy and posts corrections to articles as necessary. It also indicates when an article is corrected or updated by attaching two dates to the bottom of an updated article, one for when the article was published, and another for when it was updated. </p>\n<p>Snopes has been criticized for fact-checking satirical articles. In early 2018, Snopes was criticized for debunking a piece from the Christian satire site Babylon Bee that  “reported” that CNN had bought  a washing machine to spin the news. Facebook issued an apology for tagging the story as false on its platform, based on Snopes’ review. The site has also fact-checked stories from The Onion.</p>\n<p>Readers have accused the site of having both a liberal and conservative bias in its political coverage, although charges of liberal bias have been more common. In 2018, a meme circulated on social media of a fictional “Snopes’ CEO” in two pictures with liberal megadonor George Soros. The meme stated that Snopes “has no employees” and that “Soros and the DNC” have just been exposed as Snopes only client.” The man in the pictures was not associated with Snopes; Snopes says it employs a staff of 16, and it has no business relationship with Soros or the Democratic National Committee.</p>\n<p>Snopes poked fun at their critics in a 2015 piece titled, “Is Snopes.com biased?,” and published dozens of reader comments charging the site’s authors with having both liberal and conservative bias.</p>\n<p>The conservative Media Research Center launched a project to “fact-check the fact checkers” in 2018, saying fact-checking organizations like Snopes had failed to disclose liberal bias. The center has reviewed five Snopes fact checks as of August 2018, out of more than 300 that Snopes had done since the project’s launch.</p>\n<p>In one instance, the center agreed with a Snopes fact-check that found a liberal talking point on gun violence in schools was misleading. Another criticized “the completely humorless” Snopes staff for debunking a satire story about Planned Parenthood supporting Bill Cosby.</p>\n<p>In a third case, the center misstated the claim that Snopes fact-checked involving California water restrictions. Snopes debunked another site’s report that falsely said Californians were legally prohibited in 2018 from showering and doing laundry on the same day. California’s law doesn’t have such a provision.  The center falsely claimed that the site Snopes had debunked, ZeroHedge.com, was making a prediction about future water restrictions.</p>\n<p>In July 2018, the center called Snopes’ rating of “Mixture” to the claim that San Francisco was registering “illegal aliens” to vote “deeply distorted.” Snopes arrived at the rating because San Francisco is allowing undocumented immigrants with children in the city’s school system to vote in school board elections, while not allowing them to vote in other elections.</p>\n<p>The Media Research Center also argued that Snopes showed its liberal bias when fact-checking a widely shared photo of a child in a cage. The photo went viral because it was widely believed to depict a child separated from its parents under President Donald Trump’s immigration policy. But the photo was actually taken at a protest against that policy in front of Dallas City Hall. The center said Snopes should have rated the report “False” instead of “Miscaptioned,” which is a standard rating Snopes applies to images that are placed out of context. </p>\n<p>NewsGuard reviewed seven claims by the conservative Daily Caller site that Snopes fact checks written between 2016 and 2018 were inaccurate or showed liberal bias. A NewsGuard review of all seven claims found only one to be valid. Snopes gave a “Mixture” rating to a report that Orlando nightclub gunman Omar Mateen was a Democrat at the time of the June 2016 shooting that killed 49 people.</p>\n<p>Mateen was indeed registered as a Democrat, as of 2006, according to Florida voting records. Asked about the rating by NewsGuard, Mikkelson reiterated the explanation that Snopes gave in the fact check: “Voter registration by itself is a notoriously poor indicator of political affiliation. If the person doesn’t demonstrate any other outward signs … you have no idea how that person voted, or if they ever voted at all.” </p>\n<p>In 2016, Snopes and The Daily Caller engaged in a fact-checking feud over the accuracy of each site’s reporting, publishing combative headlines and pot shots that went beyond objective reporting. First, Daily Caller reporter Peter Hasson published a story attacking one Snopes writer as a “failed liberal blogger” after Snopes fact-checked two of Hasson’s stories over two weeks in 2016. Snopes responded with a July 2016 post headlined “Daily Caller Throws Another Temper Tantrum After Being Debunked by snopes.com.” </p>\n<p>The post, which was authored by “Snopes Staff,” prefaced a quote from a Daily Caller story by saying, “On 25 July 2016, a Daily Caller ‘reporter’ (if you can call someone who turns in a three-sentence article that wouldn’t pass muster in a sixth-grade class a ‘reporter’) …” </p>\n<p>And in October 2016, Mikkelson inserted an unattributed block quote in a story that was titled “Daily Caller Caught Lying Yet Again,” which asserted the Daily Caller had made a false report involving voting machines and liberal philanthropist George Soros. The block quote in the Snopes piece, however, which began “HILLARY CLINTON IS RIGGING THE ELECTION,” never appeared in the Daily Caller story.</p>\n<p>Snopes has also inserted commentary into other fact checks. For example, a December 2017 fact check characterized a Conservative Tribune story as an attempt to “foment racial prejudice” in a report that linked “animal brothels” to Germany’s migrant population growth. “This transparent attempt to spark fear and hatred is based on false information,” Snopes wrote.</p>\n<p>The site’s open criticism in fact checks of the Daily Caller, and editorializing in other fact checks,  led NewsGuard to determine that Snopes does not consistently handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. Mikkelson and Snopes VP of Operations Vincent Green did not respond to emails asking if the site handled the feud with Daily Caller properly. </p>\n<p>All editorial employees who work for Snopes have experience in journalism, according to biographies on the site, except for Mikkelson,  who was a “computer tech and a coder at an HMO” when he launched Snopes in 1994, according to a profile in Wired. All editorial staff members have completed a course called “Fact-Checking: How to Improve Your Skills in Accountability Journalism” from Poynter’s NewsU and the American Press Institute, according to Snopes. Editorial staff are forbidden from making political donations or participating in political campaigns, parties, or advocacy. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Snopes discloses that the site is owned Snopes Media Group, and lists its board of directors, which includes Mikkelson, as well as Brad Westbrook and Chris Richmond, who are Proper Media Group shareholders currently battling with Mikkelson for control of the site.</p>\n<p>Snopes provides an author byline on most stories, although some have a “Snopes Staff” byline. Mikkelson and Green did not respond to an email asking when and why Snopes choose to run a staff byline.  </p>\n<p>Snopes says that at least two editors review and edit every story before publication, although editors are not listed on individual stories. Snopes lists staff members with titles and biographies and, in most cases, links to their social media profiles. Snopes does not provide email addresses of individual staff members, but does provide a form for users to contact the website. </p>\n<p>Mikkelson told NewsGuard the site prefers to use a central email system. “Individuals could be out that day or on vacation and an email might not get seen,” he said.</p>\n<p>Snopes also has opted out of the archiving feature at Archive.org, meaning that the site’s pages, and any updates over time, are not saved. Mikkelson and Green did not respond to an email asking why the site has been exempted from Archive.org.</p>\n<p>The site’s ads are clearly differentiated from original content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>David and Barbara Mikkelson started Snopes in 1994, and were the site’s only two employees until 2014. The site now employs 16 people, according to the site’s Our Team page. In 2018, the site’s parent company, Bardav Inc., changed its name to Snopes Media Group. </p>\n<p>The name Snopes is taken from the name of a family that appears in the novels of William Faulkner. Mikkelson told The New York Times in 2010 that “the Snopes were on the bottom rung of the social ladder. But none of that has anything to do with the site.”</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJosh Keefe\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Yemile
