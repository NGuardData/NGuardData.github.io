Listeners pay a monthly fee to access audio files from Limbaugh’s weekday three-hour radio show, along with other material related to his work. Visitors without a subscription can access transcripts of the Rush Limbaugh Show, as well as a small selection of video clips of Limbaugh’s commentary.</p>\n<p>The Rush Limbaugh Show does not present itself as an objective news source. Its transcripts feature Limbaugh’s personal opinions in reaction to daily news and political events. Topics include President Trump and his administration, Democratic politicians and “the left,” and mainstream news organizations (which Limbaugh calls “Drive-Bys”). The transcripts feature a list of sources, ranging from Breitbart and the Daily Caller to NBC and The New York Times. Limbaugh’s About section states, “I won’t stop until everyone agrees with me.”</p>\n<p>The site’s About page states that the show provides an “unprecedented combination of serious discussion of political, cultural and social issues along with satirical and biting humor.” The site also features a link to “Adventures of Rush Revere,” a children’s book series.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>NewsGuard determined that the Rush Limbaugh Show fails to present news and information responsibly. Limbaugh regularly makes bold assertions that present his own opinions as fact.  </p>\n<p>For example, in September 2017, Limbaugh told Florida listeners that official hurricane warnings and mandatory evacuation orders were unfounded, claiming that the”panic” created by the “Drive-By Media” was “to merely advance this climate change agenda.” Limbaugh was heavily criticized by news organizations, including USA Today, the Miami Herald, the Washington Post, and CNN, for his remarks on the effects of Irma, which was one of the most powerful storms ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean. NBC’s Al Roker tweeted, “To have @rushlimbaugh suggest the warnings about #Irma are #fake or about profit and to ignore them borders on criminal,” and that Limbaugh was “putting people's lives at risk.”</p>\n<p>Limbaugh regularly presents speculation as fact. Addressing the “birther” conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was born in Kenya, Limbaugh stated in January 2016 that “Barack Hussein Obama is as responsible for this whole birther thing as anybody else… I’m not sure on all the specific details, but he was trying when he was a student somewhere — I think at Columbia. He was trying to get a publishing deal or job or some such thing; he knew it would make him look much sexier if he were foreign born. So he lied and told some people he was born in Kenya.” These claims are unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p>Some of the shows -- and, therefore, the site’s transcripts -- regularly feature misleading and sensationalized headlines. For example, a June 2018 piece was titled “What Happened Since I Was Last Here: The Left Sparks a Civil War,” despite the fact that a civil war had not begun. In the transcript, Limbaugh referred to Democrats as “present-day Confederates” that are “gearing up for a war.” Limbaugh said Democrats “sure seem hell-bent on running a single-party country” and that people on “the left” are “sick and deranged.”</p>\n<p>Another misleading headline, “Netflix in Free Fall After Hiring the Obamas,” blamed a July 16, 2018, decline in Netflix shares on a deal signed in May 2018 between Netflix and Barack and Michelle Obama. The transcript’s sources for the stock dive are two Marketwatch and Reuters articles. The MarketWatch article, however, points to Netflix’s “weaker-than-expected second-quarter subscriber numbers and revenue” as the reason for the decline in shares, while the Reuters article attributes it to a “big miss on subscriber growth.” Neither article mentioned the Obamas.</p>\n<p>Rushlimbaugh.com does not state a corrections policy or provide an accessible way for readers to request corrections or see corrections that have been made. However, NewsGuard found at least one recent example of a correction notice in bold text above a transcript that contained wrong information. Limbaugh has also issued corrections by explaining the show’s mistakes in subsequent transcripts and broadcasts. However, much of the site’s false or unsubstantiated content remains uncorrected.</p>\n<p>Two NewsGuard emails to the Rush Limbaugh show and a message sent through the site’s contact form seeking comment about the site’s editorial policy and the correction of factual errors received no response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site’s Contact page lists a contact form for users and a New York street address. The site does not disclose the Rush Limbaugh Show’s leadership team or editorial staff. The site provides a biographical page for Limbaugh under the “America’s Anchorman” tab. A privacy policy identifies the website’s owner.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Rush Limbaugh Show was first nationally syndicated in 1988. RushLimbaugh.com was launched in 1995.</p>\n<p><em>Corrections: An earlier version of this label erroneously reported that Rush Limbaugh told Florida listeners not to heed hurricane warnings ahead of Hurricane Irma’s arrival in September 2017. Limbaugh instead told listeners that the warnings were unfounded. An earlier version of the label also misstated the date of a drop in Netflix stock prices, which was cited on a Limbaugh show. The shares fell on July 16, 2018.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Amy
