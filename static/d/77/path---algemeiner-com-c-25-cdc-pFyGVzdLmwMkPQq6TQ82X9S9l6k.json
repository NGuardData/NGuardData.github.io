The publication’s chief operating officer, Chana Yemini, called Algemeiner “a grassroots funded enterprise” and said that no single donor accounts for more than 5 percent of its budget.</p>\n<p>According to the organization’s 2017 annual report, the contributions and grants are sourced from both private donors and foundations, including the The Marcus Foundation, the Maccabee Task Force, and investor Myron Zimmerman. Leading donors listed in 2019 include the Scott Seligman Family Foundation ($40,000), and Michigan businessman Albert Scaglione ($40,000).</p>\n<p>The site also generates revenue through advertisements and memberships.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Algemeiner derives its name from a Yiddish word meaning “universal” or “all inclusive.” The site covers news of Israel, the Middle East, and the world, with a focus on topics related to Judaism and the Jewish people. The Algemeiner newspaper is distributed weekly on newsstands in New York City, and an e-edition of the paper is available on the website. The site’s About Us section refers to the publication and website as a “global news destination”. </p>\n<p>The site often reports on global instances of antisemitism, as well as the activities of groups that oppose the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, such as Boycott, Divest, Sanction and If Not Now. Global events in Judaism and Jewish culture are often covered, such as annual Rosh Hashanah celebrations and Holocaust memorial services, as well as news on Jewish celebrities and public figures. </p>\n<p>The site posts editorials and columns in an opinion section, which often leans toward support of Israel’s administration and occupation of the West Bank, with headlines such as “Israel Must Restore Deterrence in Gaza,” “The UN Hates Jews Who Defend Themselves,” and “The Wafa ‘News’ Agency: The Palestinian Propaganda Factory.” Opinion articles also frequently cast Iran in a negative light, with headlines including “The World Is Playing Into Iranian Hands,” “New Palestinian Islamic Jihad Leader ‘Will Seek to Satisfy Iran,’” and “Pressure Mounts on New York Times to Cancel Its “Iran ‘Journeys’”. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles on the site generally draw on a variety of sources, including firsthand interviews and  reporting from other credible news organizations, such as Reuters and The Wall Street Journal. Some news articles use sourcing from Reuters articles, and are bylined “Reuters and Algemeiner Staff”. A number of opinion and news articles are published from the Jewish News Syndicate, or JNS. </p>\n<p>Writers featured in the opinion section include a former editor of The Jerusalem Post, the current editor in chief of Jewish News Syndicate, an Orthodox rabbi, and a professor of Judaic thought from NYU. The opinion section contains a disclaimer that views expressed by the site’s columnists and bloggers do not represent the views of The Algemeiner, its publishers, or its editors. Yemini told NewsGuard that most opinion pieces are submitted by contributors and include a broad range of views. “We will, at times, solicit opinion pieces if we feel an important perspective is missing.” </p>\n<p>The Algemeiner’s About Us section describes the newspaper as “an independent </p>\n<p>media voice covering the Middle East, Israel and matters of Jewish interest around the world.” The Algemeiner also states that it chose its name, which means “all inclusive” or “universal,” in Yiddish/German because of the founder’s “stated desire to reach as many people as possible with the paper’s coverage.”</p>\n<p>However, the website’s news section publishes stories that often criticize people and organizations that have been critical of Israel's occupation of the West Bank, and articles favoring views of Israel’s current political administration are more prevalent than articles criticizing it. Because its selection of content favors a pro-Israel view, and because Algemeiner.com has described its perspective as all inclusive, NewsGuard has determined that the website does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. For example, an October 24th, 2018, article, \"Congressional Candidate Delgado Takes Heat for Saying 'Israel Is Not a Democracy,'\" originally reported by JNS.org, quoted several Jewish leaders who criticized Delgado’s remark, but did not include a statement Delgado made on October 23, clarifying his position and stating that  \"Israel is a democracy and it is a Jewish democracy.\" </p>\n<p>After an inquiry from NewsGuard, The Algemeiner added Delgado’s clarifying remarks to the article, with an editor’s note explaining the change. “This article was not written by our own journalists but by a third party newswire whose content we use. We assume the authors were not yet aware of Delgado's clarifying remarks as it doesn't seem they were circulated until much later in the day of the 24th,” Yemini said.</p>\n<p>In a November 2018 article, \"Kentucky Becomes 26th State to Enact Anti-BDS Measure,\" the article, also published by JNS, quotes several religious leaders and Kentucky’s governor, who praise the state’s decision and who speak critically of BDS, the international campaign to boycott, divest from, and sanction Israeli companies.</p>\n<p>“Our policy is to include opposing views in news articles that we publish,” Yemini told NewsGuard. “In this case, we were not able to locate statements that were made in opposition to the new law. We have, however, added a statement clarifying the BDS view on anti-Israel boycott efforts.” </p>\n<p>A November 2018 article, written by “Reuters and Algemeiner Staff” and headlined “Gaza Terrorists Keep Up Rocket Fire Against Israel Amid Ongoing Ceasefire Mediation Efforts” refers to some Palestinians killed by the skirmish as five “terrorists in Gaza.” The Reuters article, published on the same day, reports that airstrikes “killed seven Palestinians, at least five of them gunmen.” The Algemeiner’s article does not explain why those killed were identified as terrorists. NewsGuard found multiple examples of articles in The Algemeiner that credited Reuters’ reporting to refer to Gazans as “terrorists,” although Reuters stories refer to the same people as “gunmen.” </p>\n<p>“In terms of the reference to the killed Palestinians as terrorists, this is because they were claimed as members by Gaza-based groups that are internationally recognized as terror groups. In this case the groups were the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Islamic Jihad,” Yemini told NewsGuard. Yemini added that “it is our policy to only refer to those who have been killed in Gaza violence as terrorists if they have been claimed as members by local terror organizations and if those claims remain uncontested by local officials or family members.”</p>\n<p>Yemini cited examples of articles that have been critical of Israel’s administration, including an October 2018 article headlined “Netanyahu Is Harming Both Israel and the Palestinians,” and  an August 2018 article that argues for the necessity of a two-state solution. </p>\n<p>“In our news coverage, we aim to present the facts accurately and without favoring any particular point of view,” Yemini added. “We are, however, a Jewish/Israel focused publication so you can expect a higher number of news articles covering subjects that are of interest and concern to said audience.”</p>\n<p>The Algemeiner does not post a corrections policy, but does post regular corrections to its articles, which are displayed as an “editor’s note” at the end of articles. Yemini said that the site fields requests from users for corrections through a contact form.</p>\n<p>News headlines on the site accurately describe the content of articles and do not sensationalize. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>News articles are credited to authors, as well as “Algemeiner staff.” Articles that carry author bylines link to author biographies. Opinion articles include author bylines at the bottom of the article.  </p>\n<p>The site’s About Us section gives the names of its top editor, the chairman of Algemeiner’s board -- Simon Jacobson, the son of founder Gershon Jacobson -- and three members of its advisory board, including publisher Martin Peretz; Abraham Foxman, former national director of the Anti-Defamation League; and Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Biographical information and contact information for these executives are not listed on the page. Users can make inquiries through a generic contact form on a separate page.</p>\n<p>Yemini told NewsGuard, “we are in the process of updating this part of our website (compiling new pictures and bios etc.).”</p>\n<p>The site’s About Us section links to a list of more than 400 current donors. Most are listed by name, and all list the donation amount. Yemini said that information about donors is available in the Algemeiner’s annual report, which is available upon request, and will soon be listed in the organization’s publicly available 990 form. </p>\n<p>Advertising on the site is clearly distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Algemeiner Journal was founded in 1972 in New York City as a Yiddish-language newspaper by Gershon Jacobson, a reporter who had written for the New York Herald-Tribune and another Yiddish-language newspaper. Jacobson, who lived near the Lubavitcher community in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, started the newspaper after consulting with Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the leader of the Lubavitch Hasidic movement. In 1994, the paper added an English section. The website does not contain any Yiddish.  </p>\n<p>Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel led The Algemeiner’s advisory board until his death in 2016. </p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This Nutrition Label has been updated, and its rating has changed, after The Algemeiner changed its website to publicly disclose more than 400 of its donors. The website now meets NewsGuard’s standard for disclosing ownership and relevant financing.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nLillian
