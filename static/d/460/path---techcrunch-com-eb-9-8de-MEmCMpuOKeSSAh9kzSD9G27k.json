Verizon Media Group also owns the Yahoo and AOL digital brands. TechCrunch generates revenue through advertisements, sponsored content, and its international tech events. The site also links to the TechCrunch Shop, which sells TechCrunch merchandise, and Crunchboard, where companies pay TechCrunch to list job postings.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>TechCrunch publishes news and opinion featuring original reporting and analysis of the tech industry. Articles cover companies ranging from small startups to Facebook, Google, and other tech giants. Topics include product launches, mergers and acquisitions, policy changes affecting tech, and industry rumors. The site publishes product reviews and videos in its Gadgets section, sometimes in partnership with other brands. </p>\n<p>Techcrunch.com links to to Crunchboard.com, TechCrunch’s job board, and to Crunchbase.com, a platform (formerly operated by TechCrunch but now separate) providing information on company valuations, funding rounds, and executive moves.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>TechCrunch is a widely respected source of breaking news about the tech industry. TechCrunch articles feature original reporting by TechCrunch staff and often cite and link to credible sources, such as government filings and interviews with CEOs and industry experts. Headlines accurately reflect the content of articles, which are fact-based and balanced. </p>\n<p>Opinion pieces are not always clearly labeled, but their first-person point of view makes it clear that the writer’s own opinions are being expressed.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch routinely publishes articles speculating on industry acquisitions, funding rounds, or product launches. These pieces are sometimes based on anonymous sources, but the site is transparent about this. For example, a March 2018 story titled “Sources: Google is buying Lytro for about $40M” relied on anonymous sources it described as “connected either to the deal or the companies.” (A week after the story appeared, Lytro shut down and its employees were hired by Google.)</p>\n<p>The site does not contain a corrections policy, but it routinely publishes detailed corrections. For example, the site acknowledged that a November 2017 article headlined “Snap’s Evan Spiegel is clinging to billionaire status by his fingernails” was based on an incorrect calculation of Spiegel’s shares. The reporter explained his mistake in a correction at the top of the piece, adding “very sorry for the screw-up.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>TechCrunch features profiles of its staff on the site’s About TechCrunch page. Profiles include biographical information, as well as links to social media profiles. Articles name the writer, linking to this information. The site also lists general email addresses for tips, questions, comments, and advertising or event inquiries.</p>\n<p>Except for a small copyright statement at the bottom of the page, the site does not disclose its ownership by Verizon Media Group — which does not meet NewsGuard’s standard for disclosing ownership and financing.</p>\n<p>Advertising and sponsored content are clearly labeled. TechCrunch discloses that it may receive commissions if readers purchase products from links included with reviews. The site discloses when companies mentioned on the site are financially affiliated with TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The website’s editor in chief, Matthew Panzarino, did not respond to two NewsGuard emails asking about the website’s disclosure of ownership.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Michael Arrington, a tech entrepreneur, founded TechCrunch in 2005. Arrington and a former colleague, Keith Teare, have publicly argued about Teare’s involvement in the founding of the company. In February 2018, Arrington stated on his personal blog that he and Teare had come to an agreement that Teare “will refer to himself as a “Founding Shareholder” instead of as a “co-founder.” AOL Inc. purchased TechCrunch in 2010 for $25 million.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: Upon further review, this label has been updated to reflect that the site does not transparently disclose ownership information.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling\n\nEdited by:\nSarah Brandt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/\" target=\"_blank\">https://techcrunch.com/events/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oath.com/brands/techcrunch/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.oath.com/brands/techcrunch/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunchstore.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://techcrunchstore.com/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/include/\" target=\"_blank\">https://techcrunch.com/include/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/zuckerberg-deleted-messages/\" target=\"_blank\">https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/zuckerberg-deleted-messages/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/14/no-peter-thiel-is-not-harvesting-the-blood-of-the-young/\" target=\"_blank\">https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/14/no-peter-thiel-is-not-harvesting-the-blood-of-the-young/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/26/snaps-evan-spiegel-is-still-very-rich/\" target=\"_blank\">https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/26/snaps-evan-spiegel-is-still-very-rich/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/19/amazons-prime-video-app-becomes-the-most-downloaded-apple-tv-app-to-date/\" target=\"_blank\">https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/19/amazons-prime-video-app-becomes-the-most-downloaded-apple-tv-app-to-date/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/sources-google-is-buying-lytro-for-about-40m/\" target=\"_blank\">https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/sources-google-is-buying-lytro-for-about-40m/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/gadgets-and-small-appliances-that-will-keep-you-in-the-kitchen/\" target=\"_blank\">https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/gadgets-and-small-appliances-that-will-keep-you-in-the-kitchen/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/06/in-canadas-cloud-services-market-venture-investment-opportunities-abound/\" target=\"_blank\">https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/06/in-canadas-cloud-services-market-venture-investment-opportunities-abound/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://uncrunched.com/2018/02/18/the-real-history-of-techcrunch/\" target=\"_blank\">https://uncrunched.com/2018/02/18/the-real-history-of-techcrunch/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/sep/29/aol-buys-techcrunch\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/sep/29/aol-buys-techcrunch</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"techcrunch.com","author":"Anna-Sophie Harling","date":"2019-01-25T16:59:25.469+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/techcrunch.com/"}}
