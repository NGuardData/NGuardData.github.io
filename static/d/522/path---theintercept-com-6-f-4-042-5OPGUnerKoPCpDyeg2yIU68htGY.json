It was co-founded by Glenn Greenwald, who first reported on the contents of Snowden’s classified information for The Guardian newspaper in 2013.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Intercept has carved out a niche reporting on sensitive national security issues, often based on unauthorized leaks. The site describes its mission as “fearless, adversarial journalism” that holds “the powerful accountable,” but critics say the publication puts U.S. national security at risk by so aggressively pursuing and encouraging leaks. On a page titled “The Intercept Welcomes Whistleblowers,” the site explains how to securely send anonymous documents to The Intercept.</p>\n<p>The Intercept’s more notable stories have included a 2014 report revealing that the Obama administration’s National Security Agency was secretly recording cell phone conversations in several countries; a 2015 report revealing that British intelligence agency GCHQ was developing a surveillance system to monitor “every visible user on the internet;” and a 2017 article, based on leaked FBI documents, revealing that the FBI was using “national security letters” to spy on journalists without obtaining judicial approval. </p>\n<p>It also has broken news on the unfolding story of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, although co-founder Greenwald, to the consternation of many of his liberal allies, is known at times as a skeptic. Greenwald has echoed claims by President Donald Trump that Democrats and the mainstream media are overplaying the issue and jumping to unsupported conclusions about Trump campaign collusion with the Russians.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Staffed by about 50 journalists and other editorial employees, including former New York Times national security reporter James Risen, The Intercept has attracted its share of controversy. In June 2017, The Intercept published an NSA document that indicated Russian intelligence had hacked an American poll software company. The document had been sent to the publication anonymously. After an Intercept reporter showed a copy to a government source to assess its authenticity, authorities were able to use identifying characteristics on the document to identify the source as an NSA contractor named Reality Winner. She was promptly arrested, and The Intercept was criticized for failing to protect her identity. (Winner pleaded guilty and on Aug. 23, 2018, was sentenced to 63 months in prison.)</p>\n<p>Without confirming that Winner was a source, Intercept Editor in Chief Betsy Reed acknowledged in a statement issued after Winner’s arrest that the site “should have taken greater precautions to protect the identity of a source” and said First Look Media would help pay for Winner’s legal defense.</p>\n<p>“As the news outlet Winner is accused of leaking to, The Intercept has a unique perspective on her case and a passionate desire to see her receive a fair trial,” Reed said, “even though we had no idea who our source was and still have no independent knowledge of the source’s identity.” </p>\n<p>The Intercept also suffered from a fabrication scandal. In February 2016, the site ran lengthy corrections to five stories by reporter Juan Thompson, retracting one story about white supremacist Dylann Roof after family members said a person identified in the story as Roof’s cousin did not exist.</p>\n<p>An editor’s note said Thompson’s editors discovered “a pattern of deception” in his reporting, including several “fabricated” quotes. In March 2017, Thompson was arrested in connection with bomb threats against several Jewish organizations, and he subsequently pleaded guilty to two counts.  </p>\n<p>Benjamin Wittes, editor in chief of law and national security site Lawfare, has criticized the Intercept for how it facilitates leaks. “If I were a foreign intelligence agency,” Wittes wrote on Lawfare,  “... maybe I'd just use the opportunity to drop disinformation on journalists who have shown they will believe just about anything if it's disparaging of U.S. intelligence.”</p>\n<p>Greenwald was part of a small team at the Guardian newspaper that in 2013 --  a year before The Intercept was founded -- broke stories based on the trove of documents leaked by then-National Security Agency contractor Snowden, including the revelation that the NSA was collecting telephone records of millions of Americans. The leaks also revealed NSA surveillance of several foreign governments, including U.S. allies. James Clapper, then the Director of National Intelligence, testified before a U.S. Senate committee that the leaks aided America’s enemies and have “done great damage” to its allies. “People’s lives are at risk here because of data that Mr. Snowden purloined,” he said.</p>\n<p>Reed, the site’s editor in chief, said in a phone interview with NewsGuard that she could not speak to how the Snowden materials were handled prior to the launch of The Intercept. But she said the site sees itself as part of a “long history of journalists reporting on government secrets and exercising the First Amendment right to serve the public interest.”</p>\n<p>Reed said that before The Intercept publishes sensitive material based on an unauthorized leak, “we always go to the government to get their perspective and hear them out.” If the government makes a convincing case that publication would be harmful, the site will refrain from publishing, Reed said. “We don’t always agree, but on multiple occasions we have agreed to not publish things,” she said.</p>\n<p>Despite the controversy surrounding the Intercept’s mission and methods, because the site has a record of breaking important stories of public interest and now has practices in place to avert publishing stories that could pose a danger to national security, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not fall below the standard of gathering and publishing news responsibly.</p>\n<p>The Intercept does not distinguish between opinion and news content, and the site publishes opinionated content alongside reported stories. Examples in August include “Dear James Mattis, Why Haven’t You Quit Yet?;” “Donald Trump is a Dangerous Demagogue. It’s Time for a Crusading Press to Fight Back;” and “There’s a lot of Injustice at Home -- But We Can’t Let Ourselves Miss Crimes Abroad.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, stories on the site that are primarily straight news can also be infused with opinion. For example, an article published in August headlined “Ben Carson’s Drive to Further Segregate Housing Gets a Boost in Court” reported on a court’s dismissal of a lawsuit challenging the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s enforcement of the Fair Housing Act. While HUD Secretary Ben Carson has advocated a more limited federal role in housing, the notion that he is engaged in a “drive to further segregate housing” imparts a motive that is not backed up with evidence.</p>\n<p>The Intercept does not acknowledge an ideological orientation, describing its mission as “to hold the powerful accountable with truthful and aggressive reporting.”  (A video interview on the site among Intercept journalists includes the description: \"Sam Biddle, Glenn Greenwald and Briahna Joy debate how the left should consider free speech issues in the context of powerful online platforms.\" The introduction can be seen as a tacit acknowledgment of what the site does not acknowledge openly -- that Intercept journalists consider themselves part of the left.</p>\n<p>Because The Intercept does not distinguish between news articles and commentary, sometimes infuses opinion into news stories, and is not up front about a left-leaning orientation, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>Asked about how The Intercept handles news and opinion, Reed, the editor in chief, told NewsGuard in an email: “From its inception, The Intercept has operated on the belief that the perspective of the journalist always, inevitably plays an important role in shaping a news story — both in how the story is reported and how it is told. We eschew the standard pose of journalists as being able to write in a completely impartial manner, untainted by their own interests and views.” </p>\n<p>Reed continued: “That said, we do have columnists who write opinion pieces that are not based on original reporting, and we present those articles as columns.” She said that columns are displayed differently -- the columnist’s name and photo is displayed at the top of the article, whereas on other stories, the name and photo are displayed under the headline. (On the home page, the articles are not distinguishable until the user clicks through to the story.)</p>\n<p>As for the type of opinionated headline exemplified by the HUD article mentioned above, Reed said that “it is true that we write aggressive, sometimes opinionated headlines for our regular news articles. We find that those headlines often have wide resonance, although we try to be careful not to get out ahead of the story.”</p>\n<p>The Intercept has won numerous awards from press organizations, including a National Magazine Award in 2016 for columns and commentary by writer Barrett Brown and an Online Journalism Award in the Investigative Data Journalism category that same year for a series exposing a covert U.S. program using drones to assassinate suspected terrorists. In 2014, Greenwald’s original reporting on the Snowden leaks, which appeared in The Guardian, won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site is clear about its ownership by First Look Media, and lists the name and biography of its publisher, editors, and editorial staff. Contact information is available for every editor and staff writer.</p>\n<p>The site contains a detailed editorial guide explaining its policies on sourcing, attributions, and corrections. Its stories regularly link to primary sources, providing readers with visibility into the source of its claims.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Intercept launched in February 2014 as an online platform to report on the trove of documents illegally released by NSA contractor Edward Snowden that exposed previously secret government surveillance programs and the role of telecom companies in facilitating those efforts.</p>\n<p>The Intercept is run by Reed, formerly executive editor of the liberal weekly The Nation, along with two of the site’s founding editors, Greenwald and Jeremy Scahill.</p>\n<p>Greenwald’s dealings with Snowden, who fled to Russia and was granted asylum there, were portrayed in Citizenfour, a 2014 documentary directed by Laura Poitras, who went on to co-found The Intercept but has left to return to filmmaking. Citizenfour won an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEric Effron\n\nEdited by:\nNina Zweig&#x26;emsp;Amy
