Formerly known as Unification Church International, UCI was founded by the Unification Church’s Rev. Sun Myung Moon. UPI is based in Washington and Boca Raton, Florida, according to its LinkedIn profile.</p>\n<p>UPI generates revenue by selling advertising and licensing articles and photos to “print outlets, online media … thousands of businesses, policy groups and academic institutions worldwide,” according to its website. SpaceDaily, PopCrush.com, and Breitbart News are among them. The site offers subscription-based newsletters.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Over the last four decades, UPI lost thousands of newspaper and broadcast subscribers to other news agencies, including its longtime rival, The Associated Press, forcing significant staff cuts, and the closing of most foreign bureaus. Along with other media outlets, UPI has revamped its business model. It still offers international coverage, but has also developed its coverage of specialized topics such as the defense and energy industries. The site also republishes international stories from outlets such as Yonhap News Agency in South Korea, and Medill News Service in Washington. </p>\n<p>UPI produces fact-based politics and news content, often written by freelancers. On a typical day, it offered readers a news article about U.S. government sanctions against Russia and China and an article about expansion of a detainment facility for migrant children in Texas. The site posts opinion pieces concerning foreign affairs, diplomacy and politics.</p>\n<p>A section called Odd News features stories gathered from other news sites, social media, and the viral video-sharing site ViralHog. A typical day’s articles included several about animals, mostly snakes, showing up in unexpected places. It did stories on the creation of a giant Mona Lisa rice cracker in Japan, and a 10-year old Colorado boy calling 911 for help with his math homework. UPI also publishes short entertainment news stories that usually originate from social media.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site employs staff writers, but has relied increasingly on freelancers. UPI does not indicate which writers are staff or freelancers. The website publishes opinion from outside contributors in a Voices section. UPI does not have a posted corrections policy. It does correct errors, and it includes a form on its Contact page for readers to seek or submit comments.</p>\n<p>“We will correct any errors  -- from typos to factual mistakes  -- as soon as we learn of them,” Charlene Pacenti, the chief content officer of UPI, told NewsGuard. “If a story contains a factual error, we will also put a note at the bottom of the story noting it has been updated.”</p>\n<p>Headlines accurately reflect the content beneath them.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The website discloses its News World ownership on the About page, but does not disclose ties to UCI. Pacenti told NewsGuard that News World has no direct relationship with the Unification Church, which she described as a “movement of hundreds of organizations worldwide that operate as either purely commercial, or cultural, or educational, or spiritual, or as media organizations.” She said UPI has a separate board of directors and is editorially independent. </p>\n<p>“While these organizations all share some form of historical affiliation with the now-deceased Rev. Moon, in many cases, including UPI, that affiliation is extremely attenuated,” Pacenti said.</p>\n<p>Since the website does not disclose News World Communications’ affiliation with UCI, and does not disclose that Moon founded what became UCI, NewsGuard has determined that UPI.com does not sufficiently disclose its ownership.</p>\n<p>UPI includes author names in articles, but the website does not provide any other information about content creators, and does not list senior editorial staff. The site only provides contact forms to reach editorial and sales teams.</p>\n<p>“At the moment, we do not have info about individual writers and editors on the site,” Pacenti said. “We are in the middle of a site redesign and are working on updating our About pages. ... There are bios in the topic-driven email newsletters on the writers who craft those.”</p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored content are easily distinguishable from editorial content.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Newspaper publisher E.W. Scripps founded United Press in 1907 as a competitor to The Associated Press. The United Press wire service once served more than 2,000 daily newspapers. Its alumni included prominent journalists such as Walter Cronkite and David Brinkley, both of whom went on to legendary broadcast careers. </p>\n<p>In 1958, UP merged with International News Service, which was owned by William Randolph Hearst, and it was renamed United Press International. In 1982, Scripps sold UPI to Media News Corporation. But the company struggled financially. It went through successive owners within the next two decades, and bankruptcies in 1985 and 1990. News World Communications bought UPI in 2000 for an undisclosed amount.</p>\n<p>UPI spearheaded many practices of modern journalism, including use of author names on stories. It was one of the first news agencies to publish interviews with world leaders, including Neville Chamberlain, President Dwight Eisenhower, and Joseph Stalin. UPI has won 11 Pulitzer prizes. The wire service’s White House correspondent Merriman Smith, who was the first journalist to report the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, won the 1964 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting.  </p>\n<p>Since Moon’s death in 2012, his family has fought over leadership of various businesses. One enterprise, U.S weapons manufacturer Kahr Arms, which was founded by Moon’s son Justin, is uncontested. UCI chairman Preston Moon, son of the late leader, is the founder and chairman of Global Peace Foundation, a Seattle-based organization that seeks “a values-based approach to peace building,” according to the About Us section of its website.</p>\n<p>Another media outlet, The Washington Times, has been owned by the Unification Church, through different shell companies, since it was founded in 1982.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSophia Tewa\n\nEdited by:\nPeggy
