Content is separated into the broad sections of Politics, World, Economy, Culture and Take Action, which encourages readers to take liberal stances on a variety of issues. For example, a July 2018 story urged readers to call their senators and demand that they oppose the President Donald Trump’s nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court and linked to a script for readers to use. </p>\n<p>The site also has separate pages of stories on more specific topics, such as the investigation into alleged ties between Russia and President Donald Trump’s campaign, and the “Taking Heat” section on stories related to climate change. An online version of the print magazine is also available. Two podcasts are hosted on the site: the politics-focused “Start Making Sense” and “Edge of Sports” hosted by sports editor Dave Zirin. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles are based on The Nation’s original reporting or links to credible third-party sources. Headlines accurately reflect the content of articles as well as the site’s ideological bent. </p>\n<p>The site’s ideology is mentioned on the “About” page, which begins with “Principled. Progressive. The Nation speaks truth to power to build a more just society.” The same mission statement goes on to declare that “we hold the powerful to account, no matter their political persuasion.” The magazine’s tilt is more clearly disclosed in editorials from The Nation magazine, which calls itself a “critical, independent, and progressive voice in American journalism.”</p>\n<p>However, the site does not clearly delineate opinion from its reporting -- which does not give readers who are unfamiliar with the magazine’s venerable perspective and are instead seeing an article via an online news feed or search the information they need to distinguish fact from opinion. For example, in an August 2018 article about opinion polls on instituting a universal basic income, politics journalist Clio Chang stated that “conservatives have long employed racist dog whistles to undermine welfare programs.” That piece was not labeled opinion. Another August 2018 article by sports editor Dave Zirin, also not labeled as an opinion piece, includes a call for “agitation against Trump, Betsy DeVos, and their marauding agenda of for-profit schooling.” Articles by editor and publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel are not always labeled as editorials. This includes excerpts of her weekly Washington Post columns, which are labeled as opinion on the Post’s site. </p>\n<p>The “Nation Voices” section gathers opinion pieces on the site’s home page, but those same articles run elsewhere on the site, including at the top of the home page, without a “Voices” or opinion label of any kind.</p>\n<p>When asked by NewsGuard how The Nation separates opinion from its reporting, associate publisher Peter Rothberg said it trusts that its readers “can distinguish between what is a fact and what is an informed and passionately held opinion.”</p>\n<p>The site’s credibility has been called into question by other news organizations, liberal sites and by members of its own staff for writing favorably about Vladimir Putin and doubting Russian interference in the 2016 election. For example, an April 2017 editorial from publisher emeritus Victor Navasky compared the accusations of Russian interference to McCarthyism. Columnist Katha Pollitt criticized The Nation’s attitude towards Russia in a follow-up to Navasky’s piece, saying, “It’s as if the fact that Russia occupies some of the same geography as the Soviet Union has trapped The Nation in the defensive attitudes of an earlier era.”</p>\n<p>Other writers at The Nation have been accused of being overly sympathetic to Putin’s Russia. Contributor Stephen Cohen, husband of editor and publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel, asserted in a March 2018 article that there was “no reason to doubt the magnitude or authentic nature of Putin’s victory” in the 2018 Russian presidential election,” contradicting reports of fraud, forced voting and ballot box stuffing. As reported by Think Progress in July 2018, some of Cohen’s other article have been cross-posted both in The Nation and the Russian government-owned RT. Neither Cohen’s contributions to RT nor his marriage to The Nation’s editor and publisher are disclosed on TheNation.com.   </p>\n<p>Original reporting from The Nation on Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 election has also been criticized. An August 2017 article from contributor Patrick Lawrence, casting doubt on assertions by the U.S. intelligence community’s that Putin ordered the hacking of computers at the Democratic National Committee, was reviewed post-publication, with vanden Heuvel adding a 10-paragraph-long editor’s note which defended the article as a whole while admitting editors “should have made certain that several of the article’s conclusions were presented as possibilities, not as certainties.” </p>\n<p>The site corrects errors to its stories that it acknowledges, and includes a page where readers can submit corrections to the editorial staff. “We move with all deliberate speed to issue corrections,” Rothberg said in an email to NewsGuard. “We correct the text so that misinformation is no longer out there, and we note the nature of the correction at the bottom of the article.” </p>\n<p>More serious errors are disclosed at the top of articles. For example, a Nov. 2017 article entitled “Are Sexual Predators in the Workplace Finally Facing Justice?” said Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi had “boasted about molesting teenagers and constantly harassing staffers in ‘The eXile,’” which the Nation originally described as a “memoir.” According to a Dec. 2017 story in Paste magazine, the book’s publisher, Grove Press, told the Guardian that the book “combines exaggerated, invented satire and nonfiction reporting and was categorized as nonfiction because there is no category for a book that is both.” In the same article, women who worked for Taibbi denied that he sexually harassed them, and said the situations described in the book “never happened.” The Nation issued a correction in Feb. 2018, four months after the article was originally published, stating that the original passage about Taibbi was inaccurate and had been removed. A tweet from Taibbi confirmed the two sides had reached a settlement on the issue.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Most articles are credited to contributors and reporters, with their names linking to a short biography and recent work. Exceptions are articles credited to “NationAction,” encouraging readers to contact legislators or companies to support liberal stances on various issues, and weekly editorials credited only to “The Nation.” Less frequently, published stories are credited to “various contributors.” When the article’s author is not a member of The Nation’s staff, his or her affiliation will be explained at the bottom of the article. The site’s leadership, editorial board, department heads, columnists, contributors and other staff members are listed on the “Masthead” page. </p>\n<p>No contact information for individual editors or contributors is provided. The “Contact Us” page contains a general contact form and a separate page allows readers to submit letters to the editor for publication in the Nation’s print edition. Advertisements are clearly labeled.</p>\n<p>Associate publisher Peter Rothberg told NewsGuard in an email that editor and publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel has sole controlling interest in the magazine. When asked if her ownership is disclosed on TheNation.com, Rothberg said being named as publisher “suggests her ownership, but we don’t say anything about the issue beyond that.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The print magazine was founded by a group of abolitionists in 1865 with Edwin Lawrence Godkin serving as its first editor. One of the magazine’s earliest reporting subjects was the South during Reconstruction. The founding prospectus by publisher Joseph Richards announced the magazine as a “weekly journal of politics, literature, science and art” that “will not be the organ of any party, sect or body.”</p>\n<p>The Nation<em> </em>was sold to the New York Evening Post in 1881. Oswald Garrison Villard, son of Evening Post owner Henry Villard, retained ownership after selling the Evening Post in 1918, and began pushing the magazine towards being a left-leaning current affairs publication. The magazine was later a major supporter of President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal. This identity was maintained throughout several ownership changes between the 1930s and 50s, during which time the magazine was attacked as pro-Communist for criticizing the hearings run by Sen. Joe McCarthy, which were later widely denounced, as well as for writing favorably of Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union.</p>\n<p>The magazine’s reputation changed with its coverage of the civil rights movement, feminism and the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1960s, such as when editor Carey McWilliams became the first American journalist to write that the CIA was training Cuban exiles in preparation for the Bay of Pigs invasion. Ownership of the magazine changed hands several times before it was acquired in 1995 by a group of investors including then-editor-in-chief Victor Navasky, his successor, vanden Heuvel, and actor Paul Newman.   </p>\n<p>The first digital edition of the magazine was published in Dec. 1996.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJohn Gregory\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Joyce
