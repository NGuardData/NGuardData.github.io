In 2016, the information technology company acquired The Weather Company’s digital assets, which consists of several weather-related sites, including Weather.com, and a variety of weather analytics products.The Weather Channel cable network is owned separately by Los Angeles-based Entertainment Studios, which licenses its weather forecast data and analytics from IBM. </p>\n<p>The site runs advertising and sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>At the bottom of most articles the site notes that, “The Weather Company’s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.” The site primarily provides weather forecasts and alerts, and also publishes text and video coverage of extreme or severe weather news in the U.S. and around the world. In October 2018, the site extensively covered Hurricane Michael, one of the most powerful storms in U.S. history, publishing visual-rich stories about the damage the storm caused and its impact on Florida residents.</p>\n<p>The site’s sections include Safety and Preparedness, which publishes stories about staying safe during extreme weather. The site also posts short videos on travel, health, and extreme sports. Weather.com’s coverage is sometimes supplemented with content from The Associated Press.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Weather.com editors/meteorologists write most of the content on the site, although news stories often source information from local TV stations, newspapers, and other news providers. Videos on the site are mostly credited to The Weather Channel. Articles generally are well-sourced and straightforward. Headlines reflect the content in stories.</p>\n<p>The site does not state a corrections policy, and NewsGuard could not find examples of corrected stories. Asked how the site handles corrections, Melissa Medori, a spokeswoman for IBM, told NewsGuard in an email that “our team is actually in the process now of getting more details up on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://weather.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1540484721940000\" style=\"color:inherit;text-decoration:inherit\">weather.com</a> to ensure we are offering transparent information about our editorial content.”  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Weather.com provides the names, contact information, and brief biographies for its meteorologists, which are linked to their names on stories. The site does not provide information about its leadership or clearly disclose its ownership by IBM, other than in small-print notices at the bottom of pages.</p>\n<p>Asked for comment about the site’s lack of disclosure about its ownership and leadership, Medori told NewsGuard in an email that “this is a topic that is currently in process with our editorial and legal teams, but I don't have a set deadline for that timing.”</p>\n<p>Banner advertising and sponsored content are distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site domain was created in 1994.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nEric Effron&#x26;emsp;Macaela Bennett&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://business.weather.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://business.weather.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/media/2018/03/23/weather-channel-sold-independent-entertainment-studios/452202002/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/media/2018/03/23/weather-channel-sold-independent-entertainment-studios/452202002/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wunderground.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wunderground.com/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/48884.wss\" target=\"_blank\">https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/48884.wss</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://weather.com/weather/monthly/l/USNJ0589:1:US\" target=\"_blank\">https://weather.com/weather/monthly/l/USNJ0589:1:US</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://weather.com/storms/winter/news/2018-10-16-nws-snow-squall-warning\" target=\"_blank\">https://weather.com/storms/winter/news/2018-10-16-nws-snow-squall-warning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2018-10-15-hurricane-michael-latest-impacts-florida-georgia\" target=\"_blank\">https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2018-10-15-hurricane-michael-latest-impacts-florida-georgia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45893486\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45893486</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://weather.com/storms/hurricane?pg=2\" target=\"_blank\">https://weather.com/storms/hurricane?pg=2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://weather.com/safety/tornado\" target=\"_blank\">https://weather.com/safety/tornado</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://weather.com/series/crazimals/video/watch-great-white-shark-leap-at-biologist-off-coast-of-massachusetts\" target=\"_blank\">https://weather.com/series/crazimals/video/watch-great-white-shark-leap-at-biologist-off-coast-of-massachusetts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://weather.com/news/news/2018-10-14-newlywed-groom-body-found-costa-rica-floodwater\" target=\"_blank\">https://weather.com/news/news/2018-10-14-newlywed-groom-body-found-costa-rica-floodwater</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://weather.com/news/news/2018-10-15-southwestern-france-floods-trebes\" target=\"_blank\">https://weather.com/news/news/2018-10-15-southwestern-france-floods-trebes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://weather.com/safety/news/2018-08-08-united-states-deadly-rip-currents-august\" target=\"_blank\">https://weather.com/safety/news/2018-08-08-united-states-deadly-rip-currents-august</a></li>\n<li>Is Hurricane Season Over After Michael?
