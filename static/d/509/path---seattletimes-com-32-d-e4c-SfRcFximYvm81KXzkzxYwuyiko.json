Frank A. Blethen,  the company’s executive publisher, is a a fourth generation member of the newspaper’s founding family, the Blethens. Seattletimes.com relies on ads and subscriptions for most of its revenue. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Seattletimes.com publishes articles about local, national, and international news, business, politics, entertainment, the tech industry, sports, and lifestyles. It also features real estate  opinion and obituary sections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p><em>The Seattle Times </em>has won ten Pulitzer Prizes in several categories, including Breaking News Reporting, Investigative Reporting and Beat Reporting. Its online news articles are originally sourced and written in unbiased language.</p>\n<p><em>The Seattle Times’s</em> editorial board routinely endorses candidates in political races, and keeps its opinion pieces separate from its news coverage. But in June 2012, after the newspaper (and website’s) editorial board endorsed Rob McKenna, the Republican candidate for governor, the corporate side of the newspaper ran a full-page ad in support of McKenna’s candidacy, and  another ad supporting a local referendum to legalize gay marriage. The decision by the news organization’s business side to run the ads was widely criticized as compromising of the institution’s independence and credibility by journalism analysts and organizations, including the Poynter Institute, and over 100 members of the paper’s newsroom staff. David Boardman, the paper’s Executive Editor at the time, said that,<strong> “</strong>The News Department was not part of the discussion or the decision to do this.” The tactic has not been repeated since 2012.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Seattletimes.com has an in-depth “About Us” page featuring contact information for members of its newsroom staff. It also provides detailed biographical information for members of its editorial board. The site’s  “Contact Us” page offers two forms through which the reader can send general feedback or directly address comments and questions to newsroom editors. Bylines feature the writer’s name and a link to his or her previous pieces.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Lawyer and teacher Alden J. Blethen and Charles Fishback, an attorney and mining entrepreneur, bought the young, four-page<em> Seattle-Press Times</em> in 1896 and renamed it <em>The Seattle Daily Times, </em>antecedent <em>of The Seattle Times. </em>The website launched in<em> </em>June 1997.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nKat Harling\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Joyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://company.seattletimes.com/who-we-are/\" target=\"_blank\">https://company.seattletimes.com/who-we-are/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/pulitzers/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattletimes.com/pulitzers/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/newsroom-staff/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattletimes.com/newsroom-staff/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://company.seattletimes.com/who-we-are/#leadership\" target=\"_blank\">https://company.seattletimes.com/who-we-are/#leadership </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattletimes.com/contact/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/help/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattletimes.com/help/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/the-times-recommends-rob-mckenna-for-governor/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/the-times-recommends-rob-mckenna-for-governor/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blogs.seattletimes.com/politicsnorthwest/2012/10/18/seattle-times-news-staffers-protest-companys-political-ad-campaign/\" target=\"_blank\">http://blogs.seattletimes.com/politicsnorthwest/2012/10/18/seattle-times-news-staffers-protest-companys-political-ad-campaign/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blogs.seattletimes.com/politicsnorthwest/2012/10/17/seattle-times-co-sponsors-full-page-newspaper-ad-for-rob-mckenna/\" target=\"_blank\">http://blogs.seattletimes.com/politicsnorthwest/2012/10/17/seattle-times-co-sponsors-full-page-newspaper-ad-for-rob-mckenna/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/the-times-recommends-jon-grant-seattle-city-council-position-8/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/the-times-recommends-jon-grant-seattle-city-council-position-8/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/10/17/25473481/making-sense-of-the-seattle-times-endorsement-of-jon-grant\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/10/17/25473481/making-sense-of-the-seattle-times-endorsement-of-jon-grant </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thestranger.com/seattle/did-the-seattle-times-cost-rob-mckenna-the-election/Content?oid=15280199\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thestranger.com/seattle/did-the-seattle-times-cost-rob-mckenna-the-election/Content?oid=15280199 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/24/nation/la-na-1024-free-political-ads-20121024\" target=\"_blank\">http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/24/nation/la-na-1024-free-political-ads-20121024 </a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"seattletimes.com","author":"Kat Harling","date":"2018-08-08T12:48:44.314+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/seattletimes.com/"}}
