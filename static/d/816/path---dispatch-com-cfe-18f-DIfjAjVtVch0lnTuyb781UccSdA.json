GateHouse publishes more than 140 daily newspapers and more than 330 weekly publications throughout the U.S. GateHouse has added over 100 publications since 2015, primarily daily and weekly newspapers, through acquisitions of several local and regional publishing companies.</p>\n<p>GateHouse generates revenue from advertising and subscriptions for its printed and digital products. It also operates a number of marketing and production services, such the Center for News &#x26; Design, an Austin, Texas-based unit that provides centralized page design, digital production, and copy editing for many of GateHouse’s newspapers, and for external clients.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site publishes fact-based articles, photos, videos, and podcasts covering Ohio and the nation. Its main sections include News, Sports, Entertainment, Lifestyle, Obituaries, and E-Edition. The site also offers subsections such as Smart Tech and Healthy Living in a drop-down menu. Its original coverage comes from local reporting, as well as a Washington bureau that covers politics of interest to Ohioans.</p>\n<p>The Dispatch also aggregates news from other outlets, and posts national and international articles from news services such as The Associated Press. Among its unique features are CbusNEXT, a series of stories anticipating the future of Columbus, and more than 10 podcasts covering news, sports, features, and entertainment.</p>\n<p>The site gives users without digital subscriptions access to a limited number of articles a month, traffic and weather, an events calendar, and the marketplace section. Subscribers receive full access to the website and an electronic edition that looks like the print newspaper.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Columbus Dispatch conducts original reporting and employs a staff of approximately 100. Articles are thoroughly sourced, citing firsthand interviews, as well as reputable news outlets such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Headlines are objective and representative of stories. The Dispatch regularly publishes corrections to factual errors with notes on affected stories, although it does not post a specific policy online.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site’s Contact Us page lists a phone number for general inquiries and an extensive staff directory that includes phone numbers and email addresses. Stories contain authors’ names, email addresses, and Twitter handles.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are clearly labeled, and branded content is placed in a separate section.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Columbus Dispatch began publishing in 1871, when 10 printers pooled $900 to start an  afternoon paper they called The Daily Dispatch. After a succession of owners, brothers Harry and Robert Wolfe, who owned a shoe company and The Ohio State Journal, bought the paper, then called The Columbus Evening Dispatch, in 1905.</p>\n<p>Columbus native and New Yorker humorist and cartoonist James Thurber got his start in 1920 at The Dispatch, where he wrote a column, “Credos and Curios.” The newspaper became a morning daily in 1986, and launched its website in 1995.</p>\n<p>The Wolfe family sold the newspaper to New Media Investment Group in 2015.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Peggy Ackermann&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gatehousemedia.com/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.gatehousemedia.com/about-us/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=247541655\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=247541655</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newmediainv.com/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newmediainv.com/about-us/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gatehousemedia.com/commercial-services/#1458536317136-8c876d4d-f48d\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.gatehousemedia.com/commercial-services/#1458536317136-8c876d4d-f48d</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gatehousemedia.com/our-markets/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.gatehousemedia.com/our-markets/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.advertisecolumbus.com/newspapers/the-columbus-dispatch\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.advertisecolumbus.com/newspapers/the-columbus-dispatch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gatehousenews.com/cbusnext/home/site/dispatch.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.gatehousenews.com/cbusnext/home/site/dispatch.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/podcasts\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dispatch.com/podcasts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/photos?start=2\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dispatch.com/photos?start=2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/videos\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dispatch.com/videos</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/news/20180521/correction-2018-midterms-endorsements-story\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dispatch.com/news/20180521/correction-2018-midterms-endorsements-story</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dispatch.com/contact</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/ara\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dispatch.com/ara</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/about-the-dispatch\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dispatch.com/about-the-dispatch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/business/2015/06/15/dispatch-sale-to-new-media-closes.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/business/2015/06/15/dispatch-sale-to-new-media-closes.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/07/01/dispatch-timeline.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/07/01/dispatch-timeline.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"dispatch.com","author":"Sarah Brandt","date":"2018-09-18T13:50:56.548+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/dispatch.com/"}}
