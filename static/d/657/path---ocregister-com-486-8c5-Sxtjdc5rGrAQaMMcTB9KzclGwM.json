Alden Global Capital, a New York-based hedge fund, has been the majority owner of Digital First since 2009. It received national attention in 2018 following major layoffs at the Denver Post that prompted the paper to run a special section criticizing ownership. Ocregister.com revenue comes largely from advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Ocregister.com publishes original news and opinions articles covering business, politics, sports, and culture in the Orange County area, with subsections providing local coverage for each town in the county. The site also publishes national and global news articles sourced from other news agencies like The Associated Press. According to the site’s “About Us” section, The Register is “focused on serving Orange County and helping it thrive.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles original to The Register are fact-based, using first-hand reporting corroborated by multiple other sources. Content from other sources comes from established news organizations like The Associated Press and Bloomberg. Opinions pieces come from The Register’s editorial board, an independent group separate from the news-gathering side of the staff. The site features a “Corrections” section outlining how to report an error in a story and featuring corrections that have been issued. The newspaper’s prizes include the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting for disclosing fraudulent fertility practices at a research university hospital that prompted regulatory reforms.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles are bylined and often include a photo, contact information, and the author’s biography. Further, the “Contact” section of the site centrally lists the names, phone numbers, and email addresses of its newsroom and business staff. The section also provides email addresses for readers to submit tips or letters to the editor. The site states its connection to Digital First Media on the bottom of its webpage. However, the link to Alden Global Capital is not disclosed anywhere on the site of The Register or of Digital First Media, though The Register has published articles reporting on Alden’s ownership.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>A group of businessmen founded the Santa Ana Daily Register in 1905, which was renamed the Orange County Register in 1985. The Register received three Pulitzer Prizes in the 1980s and 1990s: one in 1985 for photographs of the Olympics, a second in 1989 for coverage of military affairs, and a third in 1996 for the investigation of fertility fraud at the University of California, Irvine. In 2016, Digital First Media purchased the Register and its parent company at the time, Freedom Communications. Since 2009, the hedge fund Alden Global Capital has been the majority owner of Digital First Media. Once known for having a libertarian editorial voice---it opposed internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II and generally supported limited government---its opinion section has now been merged with the more mainstream views of Digital First’s other southern California newspapers and websites.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.digitalfirstmedia.com/our-brands/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.digitalfirstmedia.com/our-brands/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://newsonomics.com/newsonomics-alden-global-capital-is-making-so-much-money-wrecking-local-journalism-it-might-not-want-to-stop-anytime-soon/\" target=\"_blank\">http://newsonomics.com/newsonomics-alden-global-capital-is-making-so-much-money-wrecking-local-journalism-it-might-not-want-to-stop-anytime-soon/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-26/alden-global-capital-s-business-model-destroys-newspapers-for-little-gain\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-26/alden-global-capital-s-business-model-destroys-newspapers-for-little-gain</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dfmworkers.org/newspapers-and-communities-pay-for-bad-hedge-fund-bets/\" target=\"_blank\">https://dfmworkers.org/newspapers-and-communities-pay-for-bad-hedge-fund-bets/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ocregister.com/contact/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.socalnewsgroup.com/company-profile/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.socalnewsgroup.com/company-profile/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ocregister.com/about-us/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-ocr-layoffs-20180115-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-ocr-layoffs-20180115-story.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ocr.scng.com/media-kits\" target=\"_blank\">http://ocr.scng.com/media-kits</a></li>\n<li>Orange County Register</li>\n<li>ExcelsiorOC Family</li>\n<li>Orange County Coast</li>\n<li>Segerstrom Center for the Arts</li>\n<li>OC Community Newspaper</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/2009/10/14/company-information-and-history/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ocregister.com/2009/10/14/company-information-and-history/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-orange-county-register-digital-first-media-tribune-publishing-20160319-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-orange-county-register-digital-first-media-tribune-publishing-20160319-story.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/digital-first-media-workers-take-on-alden-global-capital-hedge-fund-300286206.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/digital-first-media-workers-take-on-alden-global-capital-hedge-fund-300286206.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=ocregister.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=ocregister.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/2013/04/08/register-launches-online-paywall/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ocregister.com/2013/04/08/register-launches-online-paywall/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/tag/corrections/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ocregister.com/tag/corrections/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/2017/08/18/corrections-heres-how-to-report-an-error/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ocregister.com/2017/08/18/corrections-heres-how-to-report-an-error/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/2016/03/21/digital-first-gets-court-ok-to-buy-the-orange-county-register-press-enterprise/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ocregister.com/2016/03/21/digital-first-gets-court-ok-to-buy-the-orange-county-register-press-enterprise/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/?s=alden+global+capital&post_type=&orderby=date&order=desc&sp%5Bf%5D=&sp%5Bt%5D=\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ocregister.com/?s=alden+global+capital&#x26;post_type=&#x26;orderby=date&#x26;order=desc&#x26;sp%5Bf%5D=&#x26;sp%5Bt%5D=</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/2013/06/01/about-us-opinion-staff-and-editorial-board/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ocregister.com/2013/06/01/about-us-opinion-staff-and-editorial-board/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"ocregister.com","author":"Sarah Brandt","date":"2018-08-15T00:43:26.162+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ocregister.com/"}}
