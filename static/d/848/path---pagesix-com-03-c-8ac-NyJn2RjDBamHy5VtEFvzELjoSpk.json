News Corp. also owns The Wall Street Journal, Barron’s, MarketWatch, and other media companies.</p>\n<p>Page Six operates a gossip television series, Page Six TV, which is licensed to television networks and available online through the Hulu site. The site is financed through advertisements as well as sales, subscriptions, and licensing fees for Page Six TV and the New York Post.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site posts articles, videos, and photo slideshows covering celebrity news and gossip. Stories feature attention-grabbing and playful wording, with headlines such as “John Travolta Can’t Pee in Peace” and “Rudy Giuliani Went From Mayor to Player.” Some stories report breaking news, labeled as “Exclusive.” Others summarize stories reported by other news outlets. The site also features opinion content from two regular columnists.</p>\n<p>Page Six’s tagline is “if you don’t want it on Page Six, don’t do it.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Page Six often cites firsthand interviews and reports from other news outlets such as BBC and Rolling Stone. However, exclusive stories that break news frequently rely on anonymous sources, identified as “a top Hollywood source,” someone “close to” the subject of an article, or  “multiple sources.” </p>\n<p>As a result, some stories publish unconfirmed reports about celebrities that are contested by other news outlets and denied by the subject. In April 2018, Page Six reported that “a host of stunned sources” claimed Anna Wintour might depart Vogue. But representatives for the magazine denied the report, and Wintour remained editor of Vogue as of July 2018. </p>\n<p>The site’s buzzworthy headlines generally represent the stories’ content, but sometimes headlines present unconfirmed gossip as fact. A March 2018 story headlined “Vanessa is Divorcing Donald Trump Jr. Because He’s Cheap,” presented a theory about the motivation for the divorce, confirmed by “friends” of Vanessa Trump and “multiple sources” as fact.</p>\n<p>Though the site does not state a corrections policy, Page Six has issued corrections in the past when stories have been proven false. Page Six published a follow-up story in 2013 after fashion designer Rachel Zoe denied an earlier, anonymously sourced report that her business was failing. The site also updated a January 2015 article that originally attributed the divorce of a New York news anchor to infidelity, saying the report was inaccurate.</p>\n<p>Opinion stories from the site’s regular columnists appear in their own section.</p>\n<p>Page Six did not respond to two emails from NewsGuard seeking comment on the site’s reporting, description of anonymous sources, and corrections policy.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The bottom of the site makes clear its affiliation with the New York Post and states its ownership by News Corp. The site does not identify its leadership, but links to the “Contact” page of the New York Post, which provides the email address of the head of the Page Six editorial department. Page Six did not respond to two emails from NewsGuard seeking comment on the site’s disclosure of its leadership.</p>\n<p>Stories listing the author’s names often link to a page with the author’s photograph, contact information, and other stories. Though the site often relies on anonymous sources, it cites and links to sources it does name. Advertisements and sponsored stories are labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The New York Post started Page Six as the gossip section of its daily newspaper in 1977,<strong> </strong>after Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch purchased the paper and added a gossip page, among  several features common to Australian and British tabloids. Page Six became a registered domain in 1996 and contains an archive with stories dating back to 1999. Page Six TV began in 2017.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hulu.com/page-six-tv\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.hulu.com/page-six-tv</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://pagesix.com/tv/about/\" target=\"_blank\">https://pagesix.com/tv/about/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2018/04/13/arnold-schwarzenegger-is-not-great-yet-post-heart-surgery/\" target=\"_blank\">https://pagesix.com/2018/04/13/arnold-schwarzenegger-is-not-great-yet-post-heart-surgery/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2017/01/31/travis-barker-selling-modern-la-home-for-4-7m/\" target=\"_blank\">https://pagesix.com/2017/01/31/travis-barker-selling-modern-la-home-for-4-7m/</a></li>\n<li>Tagline on FB <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/pagesix/about/?ref=page_internal&nbsp;and\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pg/pagesix/about/?ref=page_internal and</a> Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pagesix\">https://twitter.com/pagesix</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2018/06/15/john-travolta-cant-pee-in-peace/&nbsp;https://pagesix.com/tv/rudy-giuliani-went-from-mayor-to-player/\" target=\"_blank\">https://pagesix.com/2018/06/15/john-travolta-cant-pee-in-peace/ https://pagesix.com/tv/rudy-giuliani-went-from-mayor-to-player/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2018/03/19/vanessa-is-divorcing-donald-trump-jr-because-hes-cheap/\" target=\"_blank\">https://pagesix.com/2018/03/19/vanessa-is-divorcing-donald-trump-jr-because-hes-cheap/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2008/oct/28/Michelle-Obama-lobster-Waldorf-Astoria/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2008/oct/28/Michelle-Obama-lobster-Waldorf-Astoria/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-vanessa-divorce-cheap.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thecut.com/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-vanessa-divorce-cheap.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2018/03/15/matt-damon-moving-family-to-australia-because-of-trump/&nbsp;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/is-matt-damon-moving-to-australia/\" target=\"_blank\">https://pagesix.com/2018/03/15/matt-damon-moving-family-to-australia-because-of-trump/ https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/is-matt-damon-moving-to-australia/</a></li>\n<li>Anna Wintour <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2018/04/02/is-anna-wintour-out-at-vogue/&nbsp;https://www.thecut.com/2018/04/anna-wintour-vogue-magazine-denies-leaving.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://pagesix.com/2018/04/02/is-anna-wintour-out-at-vogue/ https://www.thecut.com/2018/04/anna-wintour-vogue-magazine-denies-leaving.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2012/08/27/labels-doing-not-zoe-well/&nbsp;https://pagesix.com/2013/03/06/rachel-zoe-reacts-to-page-six-report-labels-not-doing-zoe-well/&nbsp;https://fashionista.com/2013/03/rachel-zoe-slams-page-six-for-starting-made-up-rumors-her-line-isnt-doing-well\" target=\"_blank\">https://pagesix.com/2012/08/27/labels-doing-not-zoe-well/ https://pagesix.com/2013/03/06/rachel-zoe-reacts-to-page-six-report-labels-not-doing-zoe-well/ https://fashionista.com/2013/03/rachel-zoe-slams-page-six-for-starting-made-up-rumors-her-line-isnt-doing-well</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2015/01/15/wpixs-fadal-seen-looking-cozy-with-steve-guttenberg/\" target=\"_blank\">https://pagesix.com/2015/01/15/wpixs-fadal-seen-looking-cozy-with-steve-guttenberg/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://nypost.com/contact/?_ga=2.192361770.1430420851.1529017517-374346308.1529017517\" target=\"_blank\">https://nypost.com/contact/?_ga=2.192361770.1430420851.1529017517-374346308.1529017517</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pagesix.com/sitemap/\" target=\"_blank\">https://pagesix.com/sitemap/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/12/pagesix200412\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/12/pagesix200412</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/12/04/how-page-six-revived-the-celebrity-gossip-column/\" target=\"_blank\">https://nypost.com/2017/12/04/how-page-six-revived-the-celebrity-gossip-column/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://who.is/whois/pagesix.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://who.is/whois/pagesix.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/29/arts/29brady.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/29/arts/29brady.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"pagesix.com","author":"Sarah Brandt","date":"2018-07-20T14:06:20.502+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pagesix.com/"}}
