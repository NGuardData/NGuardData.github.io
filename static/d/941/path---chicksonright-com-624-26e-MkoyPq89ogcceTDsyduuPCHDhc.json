The site publishes advertisements and sells shirts, mugs, and hats online.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>ChicksOnRight.com states its mission on the bottom of each page, which features a red and white high-heeled shoe in its logo: “To advance the cause of conservatism through data-driven and opinion-driven commentary in an informal and entertaining way.” The site’s About page says its writers “neither profess nor intend to be political experts or journalists, but rather offer a fun alternative to traditional news outlets.” </p>\n<p>Its posts are opinionated and sarcastic, promoting typically conservative viewpoints on news stories aggregated from a mix of newspapers, television networks, and conservative news websites. One page on the site is called the “Chicktionary,” which includes some pejorative terms to describe prominent Democrats like Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi. The site covers a mix of politics, entertainment news about celebrities, and trending news online, with the writers adding commentary to other outlets’ news stories.</p>\n<p>The site also hosts a subsection for Young Conservatives, a site founded by Josh Riddle and David Rufful, who gained notoriety when they released a conservative rap video that went viral in 2009, when they were students at Dartmouth College.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>ChicksonRight.com bases its posts on largely conservative-minded news sources, including The Daily Caller, The Washington Times, Fox News, and the Daily Wire. It also uses widely shared videos and tweets in posts with introductory commentary.</p>\n<p>In an email to NewsGuard, Weaver and Clark said they “never knowingly publish false content” and always include a link to the information source. If errors are pointed out in stories, they said, “we update or remove as applicable.” </p>\n<p>The founders also said, “Not everything we say is meant to be taken 100 percent literally, and we believe that should be fairly obvious.”</p>\n<p>Clark and Weaver gave that explanation in response to a headline NewsGuard provided that distorted facts. The headline “Ex-CIA Director Accuses Trump of TREASON … And The Entire Left Follows Suit,” described remarks by former CIA Director John Brennan after President Trump’s comments at a July 2018 news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The story quotes several critical comments about Trump from Twitter, but, contrary to the headline, did not say that most, let alone all, of the left were accusing Trump of treason.</p>\n<p>Other posts have published false or misleading accounts of daily news. In January 2018, ChicksOnRight.com reported that a new California law would soon take effect to automatically register residents -- including immigrants in the country illegally -- to vote. “All of this will be automatic,” the Chicks on the Right report said. “You can opt out of this by asking, but everyone knows illegal immigrants aren’t going to do that.”</p>\n<p>The California law does not register immigrants in the country illegally to vote, although the state law allows them to obtain driver’s licenses. ChicksonRight.com took the post down in after NewsGuard asked about it in May 2018.</p>\n<p>Headlines use sensational language and often put words in capital letters that show the writer’s opinion. Weaver and Clark said the headlines are “animated and lively, because that’s who we are.”  One such headline in May 2018 was titled “Liberals Have The Most REPULSIVE Reaction To Trump Greeting The Hostages Freed From North Korea.” Other headlines have called former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton “Crooked” and Pelosi “Batty.” </p>\n<p>The founders say they update stories with errors, explaining the change, and remove them. A review of corrections on the site show a variety of responses to false or misleading content. Stories are occasionally updated with notes that outline why previously reported information was incorrect. In another case, the site retracted a story and published a new post explaining why the original article was taken down.</p>\n<p>Some corrections do not remove misinformation. A post from January 2017 reported that someone saw a sign saying, “if Mary had had an abortion we wouldn’t be in this mess” at a Women’s March event. It was updated with a notice at the top of the article and a note at the bottom telling readers the sign appeared to be from a rally from “a couple years ago.” The first sentence of the story, however, still says a reader “sent us [a] picture of the most VILE sign she saw as part of a Women’s March this Saturday.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transp</h3>\n<p>ChicksOnRight.com includes a page with biographical information about the site’s co-founders and content creators.  The four writers have, at different times, gone by pseudonyms that include Mockarena, Daisy, Red Dawn, and Kimber. Clark and Weaver told NewsGuard, there is “really no sinister rationale behind the names. It's just what our readers have come to know us by.” They said they started the practice because they held other jobs when they launched the site and didn’t want their employers held accountable for their views.</p>\n<p>The site includes email addresses and a phone number to reach staff. Clark and Weaver are identified as the site’s co-founders. Articles in the site’s Young Conservatives page have clear bylines, but two of the three author pages for its writers provide no information. The third discloses the author is a managing editor.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Clark and Weaver launched ChicksOnRight.com in 2009. The women say they began talking during daily lunches about politics during the 2008 election and how they felt “underrepresented in conservatism.” Clark and Weaver have a weekday morning radio show and published a book in 2014.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSam Howard\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Amy
