Bravera Holdings operates a network of conservative news sites, including lastresistance.com, godfatherpolitics.com, and freedomoutpost.com.</p>\n<p>Vallorani was previously the executive vice president of Answers in Genesis, an organization  that opened a museum in Kentucky promoting the biblical version of creation, such as the belief that the planet Earth is only 6,000 years old. He also founded Liberty Alliance LLC, which operated a network of conservative news sites before being acquired by Liftable Media in May 2017. Liftable’s websites include Westernjournal.com, which has promoted numerous debunked conspiracy theories, such as claims that Bill and Hillary Clinton have secretly orchestrated the deaths of those who may hold evidence against them. </p>\n<p>DeMar, Bravera Holdings’ other owner, was for 30 years president of American Vision, a nonprofit organization seeking to “Restore America to its Biblical Foundation” by rejecting homosexuality, gender equality, and taxation. He remains a senior fellow.</p>\n<p>Eaglerising.com generates revenue through advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The About page states that Eaglerising.com’s mission is to “share commentary and opinion about culture, media, politics, etc., from a Christian and politically conservative perspective.”</p>\n<p>Most articles on Eaglerising.com consist of writers offering conservative commentary on stories published by other news organizations. Each article includes a disclaimer visible to readers only at the bottom of the page beneath an advertisement: “The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com.” </p>\n<p>Stories are regularly critical of liberals and opponents of President Trump with headlines like “Ex-CIA Chief John Brennan Encourages Deep State to Defy President Trump,” “Here’s Why Obama Has No Right To Take Credit For The Economy,” and “Jim Carrey Wants Democrats to END America as We Know it.” Commonly cited news sources include other conservative sites like Townhall and Daily Caller. Eaglerising.com has also cited news sites which, in NewsGuard’s judgment, fail to maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability, including zerohedge.com and BB4SP.com. The site’s content sections include Culture, Faith, Media, Education, and Politics. </p>\n<p>The Store link on eaglerising.com redirects to the Keep and Bear Store, which sells a variety of pro-Donald Trump, anti-liberal, and pro-Second Amendment merchandise.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Eaglerising.com has repeatedly published false claims that have been debunked by other news organizations. Multiple stories from March 2018 alleged that the survivors of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting, who became outspoken advocates for gun control, were “crisis actors.” In a February 2018 story, it claimed one of those survivors, David Hogg, was “being coached by operatives of the Cable News Network” on the shooting. Eaglerising.com also published several articles referring to the late Arizona U.S. Sen. John McCain  as a “songbird,” which refers to the false claim that he gave information to the North Vietnamese when he was a prisoner of war. </p>\n<p>Eaglerising.com stories have questioned the validity of Barack Obama’s birth certificate (December 2016), declared the existence of a “criminal pedophile ring in DC” known as “Pizzagate” (December 2016), and repeated the claim that Hillary Clinton was fired while working on the Watergate investigation (May 2016). None have been corrected or taken down. </p>\n<p>Writers have added false information to the original reporting they cite. For example, a September 2018 story entitled “#BuildTheWall Illegal Deported for Raping His Own Daughter Caught Sneaking Into U.S. AGAIN!” cites a factual story about a suspect in a rape who was caught illegally crossing the U.S. border from Mexico. The story labels the suspect as “just another of Obama’s wonderful DREAMers coming to ‘contribute’ to America.” Nothing in the Fox News story cited by eaglerising.com, or the WKRN-TV story cited by Fox, said that the 39-year-old suspect was a “Dreamer.” The term describes young, undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and may qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was introduced during the Obama administration.</p>\n<p>Other stories make unverified and unproven statements while advancing conservative opinion. A July 2018 story titled “Obama Waging a Coup?” states that liberal political groups’ main goal is a country “void of any form of national identity, governed by the United Nations via a Dictatorship,” and that “Barack Obama is waging a coup against the USA via his loyal political activist groups.” The article called MoveOn.org and Democratic Socialists of America “splinter groups” of Obama’s Organizing for Action organization. Organizing for Action was founded in 2009, after MoveOn.org (founded in 1998) and the Democratic Socialists of America (founded in 1982), making it impossible for them to be splinter groups. In September 2018, a story headlined “If Any President Was Complicit in Causing Extreme Weather, It Was Obama!” included numerous false claims regarding climate change, such as the statements that “polar ice is increasing, not melting away.”</p>\n<p>In an email, Onan Coca, who identified himself as “currently the primary editor for Eagle Rising,” told NewsGuard that the claims in these stories were “opinion commentary from various authors.” Because the information is also false, and remains uncorrected, NewsGuard has determined that eaglerising.com repeatedly publishes false information and fails to gather and present information responsibly.</p>\n<p>Headlines can be deceptive. An August 2018 story entitled “New Left Slogan? ‘Hey, Let’s Turn American Into Venezuela,’” offers no examples of Democrats using that slogan or praising Venezuela’s socialist government. An August 2017 story headlined “Schumer to Trump: ‘Allow Illegals to Vote to Prove You’re Not a White Supremacist’” misquotes Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer. The New York Democrat never made the comment attributed to him, nor did it appear in the Washington Free Beacon story cited by eaglerising.com. </p>\n<p>The site accepts article submissions from “fresh conservative talent,” inviting readers to submit work on the “Write For Us” page. Although the site lists three news editors, it does not indicate whether or how reader submissions are vetted.  </p>\n<p>Eaglerising.com’s About page includes a corrections policy, but Coca could not provide NewsGuard with an example of a recently corrected story, and NewsGuard could not find any examples of corrected content.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency </h3>\n<p>The site’s About Us page discloses the site’s ownership and provides the names of managers and news editors. The list of editors does not include Onan Coca, who had identified himself as the site’s “primary editor” in responding to NewsGuard questions.</p>\n<p>Writers’ biographies are provided at the end of their articles, but some writers use pseudonyms such as “The Common Constitutionalist” and “AFL.” Further, there is no contact information listed, which is another reason NewsGuard determined the site doesn’t provide information about content creators. The site does offer a general contact form, which is how NewsGuard contacted Coca. He said this practice was established because staff members at each site are “already inundated with email. By using a simple contact form for the site, it made it easier to categorize our Inbox.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Eagle Rising was founded in 2013.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJohn
