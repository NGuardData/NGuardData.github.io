In February 2017, Breitbart CEO Larry Solov said he was one of the company’s owners, along with Susie Breitbart, widow of founder Andrew Breitbart, and the family of billionaire investor and Republican donor Robert Mercer, which bought nearly 50 percent of the company for $10 million in 2011. Mercer co-founded and invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, the data consulting firm that came under fire from both U.S. and British legislators for harvesting data from up to 87 million Facebook accounts without permission.</p>\n<p>In November 2017, Mercer announced he was selling his stake in Breitbart to his daughters. Mercer and his middle daughter, Rebekah, provided financial backing to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, and helped install former Breitbart chairman Steve Bannon as the campaign’s CEO in August 2016.</p>\n<p>Rebekah Mercer led Make America Number 1, a super PAC that backed Trump in 2016, and leads the Mercer Family Foundation, which has given to conservative causes and think tanks, including The Heartland Institute, a leader in climate change denial.</p>\n<p>Breitbart runs ads, but many advertisers have fled the site since November 2016 due to a campaign orchestrated by a group of online activists who call themselves “The Sleeping Giants.” In March 2018, a spokesperson for the group claimed that nearly 4,000 advertisers had stopped advertising on Breitbart since the campaign began. Breitbart did not respond to three emails seeking comment about the Sleeping Giants’ campaign’s effect on its advertising revenue. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Breitbart covers the news of the day, including international, political, business, and entertainment news. The site pays especially close attention to stories about immigration in the United States and Europe, written from a nationalist viewpoint that often ties immigration to crime and violence. It also covers U.S. politics from a conservative populist perspective, which translates to support of President Donald Trump and his “America First” policies, as well as for nationalist movements in Europe.</p>\n<p>The top of the Breitbart home page displays links to several categories of stories, including Politics, Media, Economy, and World. The site also has pages on Tech, Video, Sports, and a section of stories from wire services including The Associated Press and the Agence France-Presse. Breitbart is based in Los Angeles and has bureaus in Washington, London, Rome and Jerusalem. Breitbart also maintains London, Israel, Africa, and Asia pages.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Bannon, then the site’s chairman, described the site as “the platform for the alt-right,” referring to a group of insurgent conservatives that the conservative National Review later described as a “motley crew of white nationalists, neo-Confederates, and outright Nazis.”</p>\n<p>Breitbart has pushed back against Bannon’s characterization of the site’s relationship with the alt-right. In an August 2017 story that touted a Harvard professor’s conclusion that “Breitbart is not the alt-right,” Breitbart reporter Tony Lee said Bannon “apparently thought” the alt-right “consisted mainly of computer gamers and blue-collar voters” who were fed up with former U.S. President George W. Bush’s brand of conservatism.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Since Bannon left Breitbart in January 2018, the site’s editorial direction appears to be less intentionally provocative, despite little change in the rest of the site’s leadership. The site is led by longtime Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow. Most headlines are straight descriptions of news events, and accompanying stories are objective descriptions of facts, with links to sources. The site occasionally breaks news. For example, in March 2018 the site was the first to report the Trump administration was considering tariff exemptions for Mexico and Canada. </p>\n<p>Breitbart still occasionally publishes stories that distort and omit facts, and has not publicly announced any changes to editorial policies since Bannon left the company. Three emails sent to Marlow asking if editorial changes have been implemented since Bannon’s departure were not returned.</p>\n<p>In July 2018, Breitbart ran a story about Trump saying he accepted the U.S. intelligence community’s findings that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, despite expressing doubts about that conclusion the day before at a joint press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The story did not mention, however, that while reading a statement accepting Russian meddling, Trump seemed to undercut that assertion in an aside, saying “could be other people also, a lot of people out there.” The comment was widely reported by other outlets.</p>\n<p>Also in July 2018, the site published a story covering a speech by former President Barack Obama delivered in South Africa. The story ran with the headline “Obama: Abolish The Nation-State!” The article said that Obama “pushed for rule by college-graduate political activists, such as himself.” The quote from the speech the article used to justify the latter claim did not mention college education or who should rule. Obama stated: “Some of you know, here in South Africa, my Foundation is convening over the last few days, two hundred young people from across this continent who are doing the hard work of making change in their communities; who reflect Madiba’s values, who are poised to lead the way.”</p>\n<p>The same month, Breitbart published a story with the title “Slate’s Jamelle Bouie: Reporters on Mission to ‘Fracture Donald Trump’s Base,’” which briefly appeared as the site’s top headline. The story states that Slate.com chief political correspondent Jamelle Bouie “wrote in an opinion-editorial published Wednesday that journalists are on a mission to weaken the support of Donald Trump’s base.” Bouie, in fact, wrote that “reporters have been trying to find the issue or offense that could fracture Donald Trump’s base of support.” While the difference between what Breitbart claimed Bouie wrote and what he actually wrote is subtle, it represents the difference between writing that reporters are working to defeat Trump and writing that they are trying to figure the limits of his base’s political loyalty.</p>\n<p>The site breaks from traditional journalism practices in order to attack its ideological enemies. For example, in March 2018, Breitbart ran a story with the headline “David Hogg Mocked After Twitter Users See ‘Nazi Salute’ at End of Speech.” The story was about gun control activist and Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg putting his fist in the air at the end of a speech, and how some users on Twitter took a screenshot of the moment and used it to make images comparing Hogg to a Nazi. People photoshop images of political figures all the time on the internet, but reporting on this case allowed Breitbart to publish doctored images of Hogg dressed as a Nazi, while placing responsibility for the images on “Twitter Users.”</p>\n<p>Some Breitbart headlines can be misleading. A July 2018 article about members of the media and Democrats calling Russia’s attempt to influence the 2016 election “an act of war,” ran on the site’s frontpage with the headline “Democrats, Establishment Media Push War With Russia,” although none of the people cited in the story advocated for the use of military force in response to the election meddling.</p>\n<p>That headline is tame compared to the inflammatory headlines the site ran under Bannon and former editor Milo Yiannopoulos, who resigned from the site in February of 2017 after a conservative group unearthed audio of him defending sex between “young boys” and “older men.” Between July 2015 and July 2016 the site ran the following headlines, most of which were on with stories by Yiannopoulos: “Why Equality And Diversity Departments Should Only Hire Rich, Straight White Men,” “The Solution To Online ‘Harassment’ Is Simple: Women Should Log Off,” “Does Feminism Make Women Ugly?” “Roger Stone: Huma Abedin ‘Most Likely a Saudi Spy’ with ‘Deep, Inarguable Connections’ to ‘Global Terrorist Entity’” and “Trannies Whine About Hilarious Bruce Jenner Billboard.”</p>\n<p>Breitbart has published stories that seemed designed to expose the supposedly corrupt intent of mainstream news outlets.</p>\n<p>In August 2017, Breitbart published a story with the headline “EXCLUSIVE – Deep State Teams With Fake News: Email Evidence Proves New York Times Soliciting Anti-Trump Bureaucracy Leakers.” The story said New York Times reporters were “actually soliciting government employees to become leakers,” by emailing government employees – a standard reporting practice. A Washington Post opinion piece mocking Breitbart’s “exclusive” ran with the headline “EXCLUSIVE: Breitbart confirms it has no idea what journalism is.”</p>\n<p>In November 2017, Breitbart published a similar story about The Washington Post reporters who broke news of the sexual misconduct allegations against Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore. The headline read: “EXCLUSIVE – Mother of Roy Moore Accuser: Washington Post Reporters Convinced My Daughter to Go Public.” The story treated the fact that reporters asked accuser Leigh Corfman to go public with her accusations as newsworthy, even though it is standard practice in journalism to try and get sources to go on the record. Marlow did not respond to three emails asking about these stories.</p>\n<p>While serving as the site’s executive chairman, Bannon backed anti-establishment candidates in 2017 Republican primaries as part of his effort to shift the Republican party toward his brand of nationalism. In Alabama, Bannon campaigned for Moore, who won the party’s nomination but ultimately lost to Democrat Doug Jones after five women accused the former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice of making sexual advances when they were minors. One of the women accused Moore of sexually assaulting her when she was just 16-years-old. Moore has denied all the accusations.</p>\n<p>Breitbart described the accusations as “smears” by The Washington Post, which broke the story, and gave Moore fawning coverage while running stories that attempted to discredit his accusers. For example, one November 2017 story ran with the headline “Multiple Standing Ovations for Judge Roy Moore As He Hammers Washington Post Smears at Veterans Day Event.” The story was almost entirely a verbatim transcription of a Moore speech, and it never described the accusations against Moore.</p>\n<p>Breitbart has also published stories by James Delingpole arguing the scientific community is engaged in intentional manipulation of data to frighten the public into believing in climate change. Fact-checking organizations have found Delingpole repeatedly misstates climate science and its conclusions.</p>\n<p>In a February 2018 story with the headline “Delingpole: NOAA Caught Adjusting Big Freeze Out Of Existence,” Delingpole repeated a claim he has made frequently – that climate scientists have “adjusted past temperatures to look colder than they were and recent temperatures to look warmer than they were” and said the adjustments are “well beyond the regions of error margins or innocent mistakes and deep into the realm of fiction and political propaganda.”</p>\n<p>Climatefeedback.org, a fact-checking site that uses researchers to review the media’s treatment of climate change research, found the claim misleading, noting that “some scientifically necessary data adjustments in some places do have the effect of producing a stronger warming trend than would be seen without adjustments, but others do the opposite. Together, these adjustment actually reduce the overall global warming trend.”</p>\n<p>In May 2018, Delingpole wrote a story with the headline “Delingpole: ‘Climate Change Now Even Worserer than Evah’ Says New Scientist.” In the story, Delingpole wrote that a situation in which rising industrial CO2 production exceeds “even the upper limits in the alarmists’ computer projections,” would be a “good” scenario because “emissions are closely linked with economic growth.” Delingpole also sought to discredit a peer-reviewed scientific study published by the National Academy of Sciences in his story. To do this, he cited anonymous user comments published on a climate change denial blog.</p>\n<p>At the end of his story, Delingpole acknowledged his tendency to lend credence to anonymous online commentators. “When amateurs on a blog know more about science than the guys on multi-million dollar grants at U.S. academic institutions informing global energy and environment policy, you know that the time has come to drain the swamp,” Delingpole wrote.</p>\n<p>Given the many examples NewsGuard found showing that Breitbart distorts and omits facts in order to advance its agenda, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not gather and present information responsibly, nor does it handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. Emails sent to Marlow, Breitbart’s editor in chief, senior editor at large Joel Pollak, and a company spokesperson seeking comment on the examples cited above were not returned. Three subsequent emails to the editor in chief seeking explicit comment and a phone call were not returned.</p>\n<p>Breitbart runs corrections, which are published at either the top or bottom of corrected stories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Breitbart usually attaches author names to its stories. Information about the author is typically included at the bottom of stories, usually with a link to a Twitter account. However, email addresses are rarely included. There is also no list of editors and writers, although there is a link to a section called People that contains videos of Breitbart staffers giving personal and professional testimonials, with the concluding line, “We are Breitbart.” There is not biographical background on the staffers.</p>\n<p>The site makes no mention of its ownership. Breitbart has published at least one story mentioning the Mercers that did not disclose their ownership stake in the company.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Andrew Breitbart, who previously helped found the Huffington Post, launched Breitbart.com in 2005. Originally, the site simply collected headlines from around the internet, but later it began to publish original pieces. In 2011, Breitbart broke the story of then-New York congressman Anthony Weiner’s practice of sending lewd photographs to young women, which ultimately led to his resignation.</p>\n<p>By the time of Breitbart’s death in 2012, he had become a leading voice on the right, prompting The Guardian newspaper to call him “the most important conservative of our time never to hold office.”</p>\n<p>Bannon left Breitbart to take over as the chief executive of Trump’s presidential campaign in August 2016. After Trump moved to the White House, Bannon joined the administration, bringing with him Breitbart writer Julia Hahn and editor Sebastian Gorka. As of January 2019, only Hahn remained employed by the administration. Bannon left the administration in August 2017 and returned to Breitbart as executive chairman.</p>\n<p>Upon announcing his return, Bannon gave an interview to The Weekly Standard in which he said he was returning to Breitbart and would have his “hands back on [his] weapons” to deploy against his, and Trump’s, enemies. “I am definitely going to crush the opposition,” Bannon said. “I can’t fight too many Democrats on the inside like I can on the outside.” He also said that he told Trump “I’ll always be here covering for you.”</p>\n<p>Bannon resigned from Breitbart in January 2018 after author Michael Wolff quoted him making disparaging comments about Donald Trump Jr. and others in the administration in his book “Fire and Fury.”</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJosh Keefe\n\nEdited
