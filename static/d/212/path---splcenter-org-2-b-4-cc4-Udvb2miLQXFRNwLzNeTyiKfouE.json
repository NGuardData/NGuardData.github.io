At that time, its endowment was reported to be $432.7 million in net assets. Recent donors to the SPLC include the Walt Disney Company Foundation and Shell Oil Company Foundation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center is an advocacy group that says it is “dedicated to fighting hate and bigotry and to seeking justice for the most vulnerable members of our society.” The nonprofit divides its work into three areas highlighted on the site: Fighting Hate, Teaching Tolerance, and Seeking Justice. </p>\n<p>The site includes profiles of figures and groups the organization characterizes as extremists, which are covered in a blog on the site called Hatewatch. The site also includes a “Hate Map” of the U.S. that shows the locations of  “hate groups,” as determined by the center. SPLCenter.org defines a hate group as “an organization that – based on its official statements or principles, the statements of its leaders, or its activities – has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics.” </p>\n<p>The site also publishes articles from Intelligence Report, an SPLC-published quarterly magazine that examines extremism. </p>\n<p>The site’s news section provides updates about the organization, including its litigation and public statements. The section sometimes includes aggregated reports from news outlets and interviews conducted by the SPLC.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center is often cited in the U.S. press as a source of information about extremism, and the organization has a long history of civil rights advocacy. The organization, which had a staff of 300 in 2016, has projects focused on children’s and LGBT rights, immigration, and other legal areas. </p>\n<p>Posts on SPLCenter.org are framed in a way that furthers the organization’s stated mission. The site backs up its hate group labels by quoting from organizations’ rhetoric and conducts its research in a transparent fashion, as posts commonly link to and reference legitimate sources that include court decisions, interviews, government data, publications from other advocacy groups, and information accessed through open records requests. For example, an SPLC report on the U.S. immigration system that was published in October 2018 referenced migrant interviews with law students working with an adjunct professor at Emory University. </p>\n<p>An Intelligence Report article published in August 2018 cited court filings, including indictments, transcripts, and search warrants, to detail what it said was the “downfall” of Aryan Strikeforce, an organization it has identified as a “racist skinhead hate group.” Another Intelligence Report article from that month examined testimony from former members of The Twelve Tribes to identify the organization as an “American white supremacist cult.”</p>\n<p>Case summaries and copies of case files going back nearly 50 years are also accessible on the site.</p>\n<p>Posts on Hatewatch regularly include the organization’s judgments on whether individuals or groups are racist or prejudiced. For example, a post about Turning Point USA, a conservative group geared toward college students, said the organization “regularly flirts with the racist alt-right.” That statement linked to a New Yorker article that said a former Turning Point USA national field director once sent a text message saying, “I hate blacks. End of story.”</p>\n<p>SPLC has been criticized in recent years for what detractors say is an irresponsibly broad and inconsistent definition of hate and extremism.</p>\n<p>J.M. Berger, a fellow at the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism who focuses on extremism in the U.S., told Politico in 2017 that in his view, the Southern Poverty Law Center has inappropriately used its Hate Group label in some cases. “The problem partly stems from the fact that the organization wears two hats, as both an activist group and a source of information,” Berger said.</p>\n<p>Maajid Nawaz, a British-Pakistani Muslim critic of Islamic extremism named in an SPLC publication called “Field Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists,” said that he planned to sue SPLC for being included in the publication. The SPLC eventually took the publication off its website and in June 2018, agreed to pay $3.375 million to Nawaz and to the London-based anti-extremism think tank he founded, the Quilliam Foundation. SPLC President Richard Cohen issued an apology on the group’s site. </p>\n<p>“We’ve found that Mr. Nawaz and Quilliam have made valuable and important contributions to public discourse, including by promoting pluralism and condemning both anti-Muslim bigotry and Islamist extremism,” the SPLC said in a statement on its website. “Although we may have our differences with some of the positions that Mr. Nawaz and Quilliam have taken, they are most certainly not anti-Muslim extremists.”</p>\n<p>The “Field Guide” also included Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali-born U.S. citizen, former member of the Dutch parliament, and outspoken critic of female genital mutilation practices. The SPLC publication said Hirsi Ali, a former Muslim, spread “remarkably toxic” anti-Muslim rhetoric. She responded in an August 2017 New York Times op-ed column that the SPLC “has lost its way” and is “smearing people who are fighting for liberty.”  Hirsi Ali wrote that she is a critic of not of Islam, but of Islamic extremism, and said reform in Islam could be possible through “more debate, more scrutiny and more critical thinking. It is exactly these activities that our opponents, now including the S.P.L.C., describe as extremism.” (She has offered more pointed criticisms of Islam in the past, however, including in an interview with the London Evening Standard published in 2007, in which she called the religion “a destructive, nihilistic cult of death.”)</p>\n<p>The organization has defended itself against these criticisms by arguing that the nature of hate groups and extremists is shifting. After the Center for Immigration Studies, an anti-immigration think tank, disputed its inclusion as an SPLC-branded hate group in 2017, Heidi Beirich, director of SPLC’s Intelligence Project, wrote on SPLCenter.org that “[h]ate has gone mainstream. Today, the purveyors of hate don’t always burn crosses or use racial slurs. They might wear suits and ties. They might have sophisticated public relations operations. They might even testify before Congress.”</p>\n<p>The organization uses its definition of hate to look at a spectrum of ideologies, it says. For example, a page on SPLCenter.org assessing anti-LGBT ideology says, “Viewing homosexuality as unbiblical or simply opposing same-sex marriage does not qualify an organization to be listed as an anti-LGBT hate group.” Its entry on black nationalism says such groups “should not be confused with the many non-racist African-American organizations that work for social justice and the elimination of institutional racism in America.” A page on neo-Confederacy groups says SPLC’s “Hatewatch does not list ‘heritage,’ paleo-libertarian or ‘constitutional’ groups like the SCV, UDC, Ludwig Von Mises Institute, the Rockford Institute, Virginia Flaggers or South Carolina Secessionist Party as hate groups, though they have strong neo-Confederate principles and choose to spend their time and money valorizing the darker parts of our history.”</p>\n<p>The group most represented on the SPLC’s Hate Map is Black Nationalists, with 233 groups across the U.S., followed by 121 Neo-Nazi groups, and 113 anti-Muslim groups.</p>\n<p>The inclusion on the Hate Map of nonviolent groups -- alongside violent ones -- has also drawn criticism. The SPLC, for example, identifies as hate groups the Family Research Council, which opposes abortion and gay rights, and the Nation of Islam, a Black nationalist organization whose leader Louis Farrakhan espouses anti-Semitic and anti-LGBT beliefs -- along with groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, which has a history of committing racially motivated violence.</p>\n<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center notes on the site that violence is “not a requirement” for being listed as a hate group. “The problem for us is the ideology of the nonviolent groups often ends up justifying violence, ” SPLC’s Beirich told the Idaho Statesman.</p>\n<p>Despite the criticism and acknowledged missteps, NewsGuard has determined that SPLCenter.org meets the standards for gathering and presenting information responsibly, because its editorial content is based on transparent information-gathering practices and is generally a reliable source for information in a field where judgments can be highly subjective. </p>\n<p>“Extremism is a complex phenomenon,” Columbia University professor Peter Coleman and Seton Hall University Dean Andrea Bartoli, then at George Mason University, wrote in a paper for Columbia’s International Center for Cooperation and Conflict Resolution. “The labeling of activities, people, and groups as ‘extremist’... is always a subjective and political matter.”</p>\n<p>The site publishes correction notices to articles that have been found to contain errors, and on rare occasions has retracted claims that certain people are extremist, as it did with Nawaz in 2018. </p>\n<p>In 2015, the site retracted its characterization of Ben Carson, who went on to serve as U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, as an extremist, after the group said it received “intense criticism.” SPLC had declared that Carson adhered to an anti-LGBT ideology and had a history of “appearing as the keynoter at a rash of right-wing and hate group gatherings, linking gays with pedophiles, comparing the U.S. to Nazi Germany and endorsing biblical economic practices for 21st century America.” </p>\n<p>In its retraction, the SPLC said the entry “did not meet our standards,” but added that Carson expressed “views that we believe most people would conclude are extreme.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The SPLC describes its mission in an About Us page.The site posts recent financial disclosures for the nonprofit organization and a recent annual report, but that information does include who donates to the SPLC. </p>\n<p>On its FAQ page, the site describes how it determines and categorizes hate groups. The site publishes a list of the SPLC’s leaders, with biographical information. In the Hatewatch section of the site, the authors of blog posts are often identified by name, although no biographical or contact information is provided.</p>\n<p>After initially communicating with NewsGuard by phone and email about the possibility of an on-the-record conversation regarding SPLCenter.org’s lack of disclosure about its donors and the site’s content creators, the SPLC’s press office did not reply to two follow-up emails and a phone call from NewsGuard.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center was founded in 1971 by Alabama attorneys Joseph Levin and Morris Dees, both of whom had notable legal careers. Its first president was civil-rights advocate Julian Bond.</p>\n<p>In 1987, Dees helped Beulah Mae Donald secure a $7 million judgment from the United Klans of America and others after two Ku Klux Klansmen were convicted in her 19-year-old son’s 1981 murder. The Klan organization transferred its headquarters to Donald, and it was later sold.</p>\n<p>In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Levin’s client, U.S. Air Force Lt. Sharron Frontiero, who sued the Department of Defense after she and her husband were denied benefits provided to male officers and their wives. The court held that the policy preventing the couple from receiving benefits was unconstitutional. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSam Howard\n\nEdited by:\nKendrick McDonald&#x26;emsp;Eric
