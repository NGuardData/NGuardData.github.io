As a Detroit-based publication, freep.com has a healthy auto section, covering the three major Michigan-based car manufacturers — General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler — and its employees. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Stories on freep.com are fact-based and researched. Headlines are not sensationalized and accurately describe content in the story.  The site’s opinion section is clearly defined and separate from news.</p>\n<p>The Free Press staff has won 10 Pulitzer Prizes, including for local reporting in 2009 on then-Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick’s corruption scandal. It last won for commentary for Stephen Henderson’s columns in 2014. In 2017 the paper named Peter Bhatia editor. He came from the same job at the Cincinnati Enquirer, where he oversaw \"Seven Days of Heroin,\" a print and video series that detailed the Cincinnati area’s heroin epidemic, which won a 2018 Pulitzer Prize for local reporting.</p>\n<p>The site’s onetime public editor, John X. Miller, published a lengthy accuracy checklist that he encouraged journalists to use. The paper, as part of the USA Today network, has its own ethical code that’s available on its site.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The Free Press offers email addresses, phone and fax numbers in its “Contact Us” section to reach out to different departments or submit feedback. It also shares the Free Press postal address.</p>\n<p>All articles name authors, with links to the writer’s other works, and telephone, email and Twitter contact information. Sponsored content is clearly labeled, as are ads.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Detroit Free Press traces its origins to 1831, but in the modern era, the site and the paper have seen a few different owners. Since 2005, the Free Press has been operated as part of a joint operation agreement with the Detroit News (owned by Digital First Media) under the Detroit Media Partnership banner. The Freep.com site was registered in May 1996.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJeremy Binckes\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gannett.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.gannett.com/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.freep.com/autos/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.freep.com/autos/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.freep.com/opinion/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.freep.com/opinion/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://archives.cjr.org/behind_the_news/checklist_charlie.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://archives.cjr.org/behind<em>the</em>news/checklist_charlie.php</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.editteach.org/special/editingthefuture/07_Holt/handouts/DetFreePAccuracyChecklist.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.editteach.org/special/editingthefuture/07_Holt/handouts/DetFreePAccuracyChecklist.pdf</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://static.freep.com/ethical-conduct/\" target=\"_blank\">http://static.freep.com/ethical-conduct/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://static.freep.com/contactus/\" target=\"_blank\">http://static.freep.com/contactus/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/freep.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.whois.com/whois/freep.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gannett_Company\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gannett_Company</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/money/2015/05/14/digital-first-media-reconsiders-sale/27313139/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.freep.com/story/money/2015/05/14/digital-first-media-reconsiders-sale/27313139/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20161120/NEWS/161129997/one-newspaper-town-analysts-speculate-on-future-of-news-free-press\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20161120/NEWS/161129997/one-newspaper-town-analysts-speculate-on-future-of-news-free-press</a></li>\n<li>Bhatia Pulitzer Prize in Cincinnati</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2018/04/16/enquirer-wins-pulitzer-prize-seven-days-heroin-coverage/521772002/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2018/04/16/enquirer-wins-pulitzer-prize-seven-days-heroin-coverage/521772002/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"freep.com","author":"Jeremy Binckes","date":"2018-11-17T16:31:30.013+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/freep.com/"}}
