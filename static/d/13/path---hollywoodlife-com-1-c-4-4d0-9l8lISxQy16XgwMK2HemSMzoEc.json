Bonnie Fuller, former editor-in-chief of Glamour and Cosmopolitan magazines, as well as Star and US Weekly, is its editor-in-chief and president. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site says it proves “juicy celebrity gossip, the latest entertainment news, exclusive celebrity pics &#x26; videos —  plus the hottest celebrity fashion &#x26; beauty.” The About Us page attributes the site’s web traffic to an ”ability to emotionally connect with the needs and interests of its female audience ... allowing real women to connect through the lens of celebrity.” Most stories are staff-written by reporters from the 30-member editorial team. Articles from other Penske publications (Women’s Wear Daily, TVLine) are often linked in a sidebar.</p>\n<p>In addition to celebrity and entertainment news, Hollywood Life also covers world news and national politics. Its coverage of President Donald Trump leans negative (“Trump: Lights Go Out In White House As He Tries To Backpedal &#x26; Support USA Intelligence”), and many articles encourage readers to vote or take action (“We’re Fighting To Reunite Migrant Kids Ripped Away From Their Parents: What You Can Do To Help”). Hollywood Life also produces a podcast, and offers breaking news alerts and email newsletters. Other features include quizzes and a section dedicated to profiles of the celebrities it frequently covers. </p>\n<p>Editor-in-chief Bonnie Fuller publishes a “Bonnie Says” column, weighing in on news related to entertainment, celebrities, and national politics. The column is housed on the site’s opinion page and includes posts like “Stop Mom-Shaming Kylie Jenner For Going to Coachella” and “Arming Teachers With Guns Is Ludicrous — Let’s Pass Gun Safety Laws Instead.”</p>\n<p>As a gossipy site, Hollywoodlife.com frequently cites reports by a single unnamed source or other tabloid publications as evidence for its claims. As is typical of the genre, articles often report on rumors and include the author’s point of view. For example, stories announcing celebrity birth or marriage announcements offer elaborate well wishes, and reporters frequently include opinions on celebrity feuds, makeovers, and relationships.</p>\n<p>Headlines reflect the substance of articles, and frequently include questions and unattributed quotes. Many stories include photo galleries, and images are credited.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site provides a 24/7 stream of news and gossip that is by its nature difficult to verify, especially because it relies on unnamed sources and speculation reported by other tabloids. For instance, an article titled “Demi Lovato Sober Coach ‘Not Holding Grudges’ Over Being Fired — Would He Help Her Again?” says Lovato “reportedly” fired the sober coach, and quotes a speculative statement about her former coach’s future plans made by one unnamed “source close to him.” The story also acknowledges that “it’s extremely important to note that Demi <em>reportedly</em> overdosed” and reports have not been confirmed. Other examples of stories based on gossip that are difficult to substantiate include “Kylie Jenner &#x26; Travis Scott: Why Friends Think They May Be Secretly Engaged Already” and “Meghan Markle Is ‘Overwhelmed’ By The Palace’s Rules — Does She Regret Marrying Prince Harry?” </p>\n<p>Editor-in-chief Fuller told NewsGuard over email, “It is our policy for writers and reporters to contact official representatives (celebrity managers, law enforcement, etc) to ensure we have accurate information pertaining to a given story. Often, we obtain official documentation— police reports  911 calls, divorce documents, lawsuit documents, etc. — which we then publish to support our reporting. Writers are also expected to do basic research using other credible sources to collect factual background details for their article. We also have a legal team that will review content before publishing if we feel it necessary.” She added that her team “strives at all times to get it right and report it right.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the site generates startling headlines by repeating unverifiable reports from other publications, using words like “reportedly” or “allegedly” when a claim lacks definitive proof. </p>\n<p>An article headlined “Melania Trump Reportedly Plans To Leave Donald Alone In The White House &#x26; Move Back To NYC” (June 6, 2018) cites as its source “a new report from InTouch magazine,” which itself quotes an unnamed “insider.” Only in its final paragraph does the HollywoodLife.com article note that the First Lady’s communication director, Stephanie Grisham, had denied the entire InTouch story.</p>\n<p>In March, 2017, HollywoodLife.com picked up a story from the Daily Mail attributed to an anonymous “source,” claiming that former Barack Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett had moved in with the Obamas to “mastermind” a crusade to “oust” President Trump. The Associated Press and other outlets have proven the claim false. </p>\n<p>HollywoodLife.com often publishes “exclusives” based on information from a single source, and updates these stories once information has been confirmed. For instance, “Kate Spade’s Funeral To Be Held In Her Hometown Of Kansas City With A NYC Memorial Later This Month,” (June 8, 2018) first quoted only “a source close to the Spade family,” and was later updated to include the fact that Spade’s obituary in the Kansas City Star confirmed the information.</p>\n<p>Fact-checking site GossipCop.com (co-owned by Dan Abrams, chief legal affairs anchor for ABC News) singled out HollywoodLife.com as its “worst offender” of 2017, claiming 643 instances of fake news and untrue reports. Editor Fuller responded that GossipCop.com “has mislabeled us many times in the past. However, we stand behind our reporting, our sources, and our integrity to vet every story before publication.”  </p>\n<p>Fuller noted that many celebrities grant exclusive interviews to HollywoodLife.com, including in the past 18 months Gretchen Carlson, Jessica Chastain, Viola Davis, and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Still, others complain about how they are covered. In June 2016, for example, singer Justin Bieber wrote to his fans in an Instagram post, as reported on Time.com: “Let’s spam and petition to shut this garbage website down.”</p>\n<p>The site displays no corrections policy, and NewsGuard could not find examples of corrections or clarifications issued to stories. Asked about HollywoodLife’s corrections policy, Fuller told NewsGuard that the site issues updates to stories as they develop, and provided a few examples of stories that were updated with additional information. However, none of those updates acknowledged or corrected errors. “We are often covering events in real time,” Fuller wrote. “Because of that, we are continually updating our articles with additional information as it becomes available.” </p>\n<p>Because the site publishes unverified information based on often-anonymous speculation and does not issue clear corrections, NewsGuard has determined that it does not gather or present information responsibly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>HollywoodLife.com stories display author bylines, but there is no background information about the authors, and no way to contact them through the site. </p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored content are clearly labeled.</p>\n<p>The site links to the parent company’s privacy policy on every page, with an address for contacting the data privacy officer. There is also a terms of use policy and a site-specific data policy. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Penske-owned Mail.com purchased HollywoodLife.com from Movieline in 2008, and hired Bonnie Fuller as president and editor-in-chief the following year. She relaunched the property in November 2009, focusing more on women ages 18 to 34.  </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nRachel Treisman\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Jim
