The conservative organization is partially funded by an online store that sells books, pamphlets, and films. The David Horowitz Freedom Center raised nearly $6 million in 2016, the most recent year for which tax returns are publicly available for the organization. The site does not disclose its individual donors.</p>\n<p>The Freedom Center operates other websites, including DiscovertheNetworks.org, an online encyclopedia of “leftist” organizations and individuals; JihadWatch.org; and StopUniversitySupportForTerrorists.org.  </p>\n<p>The foundation says in a statement on its site that since it was founded in 1988, “the Center has been warning that the political left has declared war on America and its constitutional system and is willing to collaborate with America’s enemies abroad and criminals at home to bring America down.” The site also says in a mission statement that no perspective, “certainly not “liberal” -- can explain what binds Islam and leftism in an unholy alliance against Israel, America, and the West.”</p>\n<p>Horowitz, the founder and president of the Freedom Center, is a conservative writer and critic who began his career as a pro-Marxist intellectual and friend of Black Panther Party founder Huey Newton. Horowitz renounced his liberalism in the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The site runs advertisements, and also links to the Freedom Center’s online store, which sells books, films, and pamphlets written by contributors to Freedom Center websites with titles such as “The Left’s War on Whiteness;” “Readin', Writin', and Jihadin': The Islamization of American Public Schools;” and “10 Things America Must Do To Defend Itself Against The Global Jihad.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Front Page’s slogan, featured at the top of every page on the site, is a quote from Horowitz, saying “Inside every progressive is a totalitarian screaming to get out.”</p>\n<p>Content is not divided into topic sections, but coverage is heavily weighted toward Islam-related issues. The site is also a frequent critic of Black Lives Matter, writing that the activist group protesting racism is “a terrorist movement, and it should be designated as such by the U.S. government. It started out as the KKK. Now it’s evolving into Al Qaeda …”</p>\n<p>Headlines and stories report on current events from a conservative perspective, censuring liberal figures such as former President Barack Obama and billionaire philanthropist George Soros. Typical headlines on the site have included “Caravan Jihad?”; “The Impending Alien Invasion;” “After Pittsburgh Synagogue Massacre, Anti-Semites Pour Salt on Wounds;” and “Bomb Threats and Demented Trump-Blaming.”</p>\n<p>Stories are often based on reporting from other conservative news outlets, including The Daily Caller and The Washington Examiner. Video clips are offered via a David Horowitz Television page. The site also publishes syndicated columns from prominent conservative writers   including Ann Coulter, the right-wing commentator; Michelle Malkin, founder of the conservative sites Twitchy.com and Hotair.com; Robert Spencer, director of the Freedom Center website Jihad Watch; and videos by Paul Joseph Watson, editor-at-large of conspiracy site InfoWars.com. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>FrontPageMag.com has often published false information and distorted facts to advance anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant views. For example, in October 2018, as thousands of Central American immigrants were traveling to the U.S.-Mexico border, the site published multiple stories promoting an unfounded theory that the group included “criminals and aliens from the Middle East and potentially terrorists.” </p>\n<p>The site also falsely stated in August 2018 that Eric Garner, whose 2014 death after a New York City police officer put him in a chokehold sparked nationwide protests against police brutality, died of other health problems. The article, headlined “Top 10 Black Racists,” described Garner as “a morbidly obese illegal cigarette seller in Staten Island, N.Y., who died July 17, 2014, when his disease-weakened body gave out as he resisted arrest.” While asthma and cardiovascular disease were cited in Garner’s autopsy as contributing factors to his death, the autopsy found that his primary cause of death was the compression of his neck and chest by the officer. His death was declared a homicide.</p>\n<p>The text accompanying a September 2018 video on the site stated without evidence that a group of people filmed kicking a traffic warden in the United Kingdom city of Birmingham was a “Muslim gang.” Reporting on the video by the BBC and the Guardian, two major British news outlets, as well as a local Birmingham news site, did not identify the suspects as Muslim. The article also said the attack took place in “a Muslim no-go zone,” which was also not backed by any credible news outlets. </p>\n<p>Headlines can often be sensationalized and misleading. For example, a story from September 2018 ran with the headline “European Courts Legalize a Muslim Kristallnacht.” It described an attack on a synagogue in Sweden, saying that Sweden legalized “Muslim synagogue burnings” by failing to deport the perpetrators. In fact, the country prosecuted suspects in the case, who received prison sentences for hate crimes.</p>\n<p>Because FrontPageMag.com has published stories containing false or unfounded claims, none of which have been corrected, NewsGuard has determined that it repeatedly publishes false content and does not gather and present information responsibly. Although the site discloses its conservative point of view, it has regularly misstated facts to advance its views, leading NewsGuard to determine that it does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>Jamie Glazov, the site’s editor, did not respond to two emails requesting comment on the site’s publication of false and misleading content, lack of corrections, as well as information about the Freedom Center’s donors and financing. The David Horowitz Freedom Center also did not respond to an email seeking comment on the site’s editorial policies.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site discloses its ownership and the center’s other websites and associated programs. A Who We Are section links directly to the Freedom Center’s website. However, The David Horowitz Freedom Center does not disclose any information about its major donors or other sources of funding, which does not meet NewsGuard’s standards for disclosing ownership and relevant financing.</p>\n<p>Stories are attributed to specific authors. Biographical information for the site’s extensive list of contributing writers, as well as its editor, is offered on an indexed Authors page. Readers can contact the site through a general phone number on its Contact page, and an email address for the editor. Other authors’ biographies often include social media information.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are clearly distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The FrontPageMag.com domain was registered in 1998, 10 years after the Freedom Center was founded as the Center for the Study of Popular Culture, by Horowitz and frequent collaborator Peter Collier, according to the site’s About page. The center’s stated mission was “to establish a conservative presence in Hollywood and show how popular culture had become a political battleground.” </p>\n<p>Although the nonprofit organization’s original application for tax-exempt status asserted its nonpartisanship, Horowitz later changed the center’s mission to address what he said was  hostility to conservative thought that had become ingrained in American academia and culture. The center’s name was changed in 2006.</p>\n<p>The Freedom Center often hosts panels and conferences featuring conservatives such as Steve Bannon, formerly of Breitbart News and a former chief strategist for the Trump administration, and Milo Yiannopoulos, a controversial far-right provocateur. </p>\n<p><em>Corrections: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label misstated the year that the David Horowitz Freedom Center was founded. The center launched in 1988 as the Center for the Study of Popular Culture. An earlier version of this label also misstated the amount of revenue that the David Horowitz Freedom Center raised in 2016, as $5.9 million, when the total was closer to $6 million.</em></p>\n<p><em>An earlier version of the label also erroneously reported that NewsGuard had found no recent corrections on the site. NewsGuard has since found one correction posted on the site in 2017, although it has determined that the site has made false claims that have still not been corrected.</em></p>\n<p><em>And an earlier version of the label gave the incorrect title for Jamie Glazov, the site’s editor.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nNina Zweig\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Kendrick
