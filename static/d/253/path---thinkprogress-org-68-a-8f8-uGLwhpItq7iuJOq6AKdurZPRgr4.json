The fund is the lobbying arm of the Center for American Progress think tank, which was founded in 2003 by John Podesta, who served in two Democratic White House administrations. It is headed by Neera Tanden, who held senior positions in the 2008 Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama presidential campaigns and served in the Obama administration. </p>\n<p>The Center and the Action Fund disclose donors who gave more than $5,000 on their websites, even though, as nonprofits, they are not legally required to do so. Donors to the Action Fund in 2017 include several major U.S. labor unions and the Open Society Policy Center, which is affiliated with billionaire liberal philanthropist George Soros. The Action Fund’s largest donor is the affiliated Center. </p>\n<p>The Center received donations in 2017 from foundations that have funded liberal initiatives, including the Ford Foundation and Soros’ Open Society Foundations, as well as the Bill &#x26; Melinda Gates Foundation. Both organizations include a few donors listed only as “Anonymous,” although the two nonprofits say they do not allow corporate contributions to receive this listing.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, ThinkProgress launched the “Trump Investigative Fund” to hire more investigative reporters. The fund raised $500,000 in reader donations by the spring of 2017 and then offered a membership service that allows users to make monthly contributions in exchange for access to a members-only email list. </p>\n<p>ThinkProgress.com runs display advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>ThinkProgress publishes breaking news, features, and investigative reports, mostly on politics, from a liberal perspective. Reporting focuses on Trump administration policies, the Republican Party, congressional politics, and social justice issues. </p>\n<p>The site occasionally publishes guest columns and opinion pieces.</p>\n<p>Every story has a request at the bottom asking readers to become members. The site’s messages, which sometimes change wording, appeal to anti-Trump sentiments, and have charged that other media outlets “are bending over backwards to give a voice to the Trump administration and its supporters, even to the point of misleading their readers.” Other messages say advertisers are punishing the site for its coverage of issues such as white nationalism.</p>\n<p>The site’s founding editor-in-chief, Judd Legum, told NewsGuard in an email that the site had heard that “brand safety” companies had urged advertisers to avoid ThinkProgress because of its coverage. (Legum left ThinkProgress in July to launch a newsletter service. NewsGuard exchanged emails with him prior to his departure.)</p>\n<p>Some of ThinkProgress’ content approaches the line separating journalism and activism. The site published a list of companies doing business with the National Rifle Association after the February 2018 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida. Readers could sign up for email updates about the companies and their relationship with the NRA. The site did not appear to actually encourage readers to boycott or contact those companies. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility </h3>\n<p>ThinkProgress reports from an unabashedly liberal perspective, which is demonstrated through the site’s story selection. It generally avoids publishing articles critical of Democrats.</p>\n<p>The site’s reporters generally avoid inflammatory language and editorializing within stories. But some headlines occasionally convey liberal opinion. In June 2018, headlines on the site included, “DHS secretary rolls out preposterous new claim about child separation policy,” “Trump falls into absolute gibberish on Russia, Crimea, and Obama,” and “Trump, Giuliani make ludicrous claims about FBI inspector general report.” </p>\n<p>Legum told NewsGuard that the site’s headlines are appropriate. “We are living in times where some pretty remarkable things are happening. I think these headlines capture what is going on,” he wrote in an email.</p>\n<p>ThinkProgress also published a story about Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore’s involvement in the creation of a textbook that contained passages saying women should not serve as elected officials. The story ran with the headline, “Textbook co-authored by Roy Moore in 2011 says women shouldn’t run for office.” Moore did write a portion of the book but never authored the controversial passages about women running for office.</p>\n<p>Moore’s campaign later issued a statement saying Moore never said nor believed women were not qualified for public office, a statement which was never added to the ThinkProgress story.</p>\n<p>Legum said the headline on the Moore story was accurate, although he said he wasn’t sure why the statement from Moore’s campaign wasn’t included. “I do not believe it was sent to us, however, and we may have just missed it,” Legum told NewsGuard. </p>\n<p>ThinkProgress reporters broke news in 2017 about ESPN anchor Jemele Hill and the network’s efforts to replace her after her controversial tweets about President Trump. It also published exclusive reporting on the disciplinary record of the New York City police officer who choked Eric Garner to death. </p>\n<p>ThinkProgress makes corrections and discloses those corrections at the bottom of the stories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>ThinkProgress.com discloses its connections to the Center for American Progress on its About page. Bylines link to author pages which generally include short biographies and links to social media accounts. Some biographies contain email addresses and others do not. The site’s editorial staff is listed on a separate page. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>ThinkProgress was launched by founding editor-in-chief Legum in 2005. In July 2018, Legum left the site to launch Popular Information, a daily newsletter covering politics. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJosh Keefe\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Jim
