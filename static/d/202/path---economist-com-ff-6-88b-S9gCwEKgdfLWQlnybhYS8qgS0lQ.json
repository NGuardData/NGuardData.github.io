The company’s articles of association state that no individual or company may hold more than 50 percent of the total shares and that no single shareholder “may exercise more than 20 percent of voting rights exercised at a general meeting of the company.” The largest single shareholder is Exor, an Italian holding company with significant investments in Juventus F.C., Ferrari, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Other major shareholders include the Cadbury, Rothschild, Schroder, and Layton families.</p>\n<p>The Chairman of The Economist Group is Paul Deighton, a former banker, CEO of the London Organizing Committee for the Olympics and Paralympics, and British treasury minister from 2012-2015.</p>\n<p>In addition to The Economist, The Economist Group’s properties include the lifestyle and culture magazine “1843,” an annual collection of financial and political forecasts called “The World In…,” and The Economist Intelligence Unit, a business research and analysis company.</p>\n<p>The site is financed through advertisements, sponsored content, and online subscriptions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Economist publishes news and analysis with a global perspective. It describes its editorial mission as being to take part “in a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.” The publication, which claims to be neither left- nor right-leaning, promotes free trade and economic non-interventionism, combined with social liberalism. The Economist’s About us page declares that it has never abandoned “its commitment to the classical 19th-century Liberal ideas of its founder” -- namely, “free trade, internationalism and minimum interference by government, especially in the affairs of the market.” The publication has publicly supported causes including gay marriage and gun control.</p>\n<p>“Leader” articles, more explicitly than its straighter news content, provide the publication’s take on global issues. Articles posted in the section in summer 2018, for example, include: “No deal is often better than a bad deal. Not with Brexit;” “How to make Eritrea, Africa’s North Korea, less horrible;” and “Emmerson Mnangagwa says he will rescue Zimbabwe. Don’t believe it.” </p>\n<p>Describing itself as a newspaper (including in its online edition), The Economist is published weekly in a magazine-like format and produces topical content covering a wide range of locations and subjects. Sections on the site include United States, China, Finance and economics, and Science and technology. The site also carries The Economist’s well-established blogs, including Bagehot’s notebook (British life and politics), Bartleby (management and work), and Gulliver (described on the site as “news and views to entertain and inform business travellers.”)</p>\n<p>The site also features Economist Radio and Economist Film, original multimedia content covering international news, politics, and culture.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Economist employs a large staff to carry out original reporting, including 20 international correspondents. The site regularly supports its news and analysis with firsthand reporting and attributed outside sources and imagery. The Economist regularly publishes corrections.</p>\n<p>In keeping with its stated mission of promoting what it terms “radical centrism,” The Economist’s point of view can be apparent its reporting. For example, articles run in its Briefing section have included “Kim Jong Un did better than Donald Trump at the Singapore summit” (June 2018); “China has turned Xinjiang into a police state like no other” (May 2018); and “America has let down its Puerto Rican citizens” (April 2018.) </p>\n<p>The publication has issued endorsements in all but two U.S. elections since 1980, saying it has backed “nearly equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans.” The Economist endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. It has also weighed in on many British and international votes, endorsing “Remain” in the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership, for example, and Emmanuel Macron in the 2017 French presidential election.</p>\n<p>While opinion is infused into The Economist’s coverage, NewsGuard has determined that the site gathers and presents news responsibly because it is up front about its orientation, generally airs both sides of issues, and does not cherry pick stories to advance an agenda.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The Economist has a longstanding editorial tradition of not naming the authors of its articles. The Economist explains that it “is written anonymously because it is a paper whose collective voice and personality matter more than the identities of individual journalists. This ensures a continuity of tradition and consistency of view which few other publications can match.”</p>\n<p>At the same time, The Economist’s website features a Media directory page naming its editors and correspondents. The Economist Group’s website additionally names the entire board of directors, the trustees, and the leadership of the various Economist Group properties. That website also names the outlet’s biggest shareholders and describes their powers to choose the publication’s board of directors.</p>\n<p>The site’s Contact Us page provides a list of general email addresses, including one for Letters to the Editor. The page also links to a map on The Economist Group site, with contact information for each of the publication’s news bureaus, including phone numbers and street addresses.</p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored content are clearly labeled.</p>\n<p>The Economist participates in the Trust Project (thetrustproject.org), in which news organizations commit to follow specific guidelines related to transparency.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Economist was founded in 1843 by Scottish hat maker James Wilson, who created the paper to lobby against the protectionist Corn Laws. The Economist’s third editor (from 1861 to 1877) was Walter Bagehot, whose work “The English Constitution” remains a significant text on how the British monarchy works. A regular reader of the early Economist was Karl Marx, who dubbed the paper the “European organ” of “the aristocracy of finance.”</p>\n<p>In 1986 The Economist published its first annual “Big Mac Index,” a lighthearted analysis comparing the purchasing powers of different currencies by looking at how much a McDonalds Big Mac costs in various countries.</p>\n<p>In 2015, Pearson PLC announced it was selling its 50 percent stake in The Economist. Three-fifths of Pearson’s shares were acquired by Exor, and the rest were bought back by The Economist Group itself; this buy-back was funded through the sale of The Economist Plaza, the famous modernist building in which the organization had been based since 1964. The Economist Group has been based in London’s Adelphi Building since 2017.</p>\n<p>The Economist launched its website in 1996.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBron Maher\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie
