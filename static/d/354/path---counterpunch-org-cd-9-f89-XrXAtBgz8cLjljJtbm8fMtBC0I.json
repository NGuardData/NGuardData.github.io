It also earns revenue through subscriptions and the sale of books and apparel. CounterPunch.org does not run advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>CounterPunch.org, which says it has been engaged in “Fearless Muckraking since 1993,” is a companion to the CounterPunch magazine, which comes out six times a year. Most content is produced by outside contributors.</p>\n<p>The site regularly publishes lengthy commentaries on U.S. and international politics, history, and books. These articles typically oppose military intervention, corporate interests, and the use of fossil fuels, espousing a leftist perspective that questions mainstream politics.</p>\n<p>CounterPunch.org regularly publishes commentary critical of mainstream Democrats and arguing for a more radical opposition to conservatism and to U.S. President Donald Trump. It frequently publishes articles by former Green Party presidential candidate and consumer advocate Ralph Nader.</p>\n<p>An October 2018 article, titled “The Pieties of the Liberal Class,” agues that reports about Russian interference in the 2016 election are part of “a feverish campaign to keep the fragile egotism of Democratic elites on life-support, to rejuvenate a party that cannot bear to face the fact that its own sellout to corporate donors has wrecked the party.” Another October 2018 article, headlined “Democrats Ahead: Progressives Beware,” declares that “The Democratic Party is too feckless either to elicit or to deserve loyalty.” An article published in November 2018, headlined “Toward Racial Justice and a Third Reconstruction,” argues for “a strategic approach for U.S. progressives and the left to maximize our contribution to defeating Trump and the far right, and advancing toward racial and social justice.”</p>\n<p>The site also features CounterPunch Radio, a podcast hosted by Eric Draitser, described as an independent political analyst and founder of StopImperialism.org. Draitser’s guests often include activists, scholars, and journalists.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Opinions and analysis presented on CounterPunch.org typically cite reputable sources, including other media outlets, studies by think tanks, and published scholarship. Stories are written as essays, often beginning with literary or historical references. However, CounterPunch.org does not explicitly state that it runs opinionated content, claiming only to practice “fearless muckraking” and “tell the facts and name the names.” Yet, content is generally written from a liberal perspective.</p>\n<p>For example, a November 2018 article, titled “Trump’s ‘America Incorporated,’” decries the privatization of some government services and functions. Another November 2018 article, “Fear of Immigrants (and Soros),” pointedly notes similarities in how President Trump and Hungarian leader Viktor Orban villainize immigrants and Democratic megadonor George Soros. A November 2018 article about Israel states: “Whenever bombings and shootings escalate in the Middle East, Israeli propagandists say that Israel is exercising its right of military self-defense against indiscriminate attacks coming from the Gaza Strip. But … the right to use force in self-defense is contingent on Israel ending its military occupation and blockade of Gaza.”</p>\n<p>Because CounterPunch runs unlabeled opinion articles and does not disclose its ideological perspective, NewsGuard has determined that it does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard sent CounterPunch Managing Editor Joshua Frank two emails, and left a voicemail with the magazine’s business office, inquiring about how the site mixes news and opinion, but did not receive a response.</p>\n<p>In late 2017, The Washington Post reported that a writer named Alice Donovan, who had published several stories on CounterPunch.org and other news sites, was a Russian working for the Kremlin’s influence operation during the 2016 U.S. presidential race and had plagiarized articles. CounterPunch published a 7,000-word investigation into the incident and apologized to readers. It also took down articles by Donovan and ran retraction notices in their place.</p>\n<p>The site runs corrections, in the form of notes at the top or bottom of articles, explaining the error and how it was fixed.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles on CounterPunch.org name the author and link to an archive of the writer’s work. Brief biographies for most authors are included at the bottom of each article and on their archive pages. Some biographies list the writer’s email address and links to their social media profiles.</p>\n<p>CounterPunch.org has a Search Authors page, which allows users to easily access information about its writers, including their biographies and archives. The site also includes information about its editorial leadership.</p>\n<p>The FAQ page explains that CounterPunch is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. CounterPunch’s relationship to the Institute for the Advancement of Journalistic Clarity is also disclosed.</p>\n<p>The Institute’s financial information is not available on CounterPunch.org, which is legally permissible. However, NewsGuard has determined that because CounterPunch does not provide any information about major donors, it does not adequately disclose its ownership and financing.</p>\n<p>Frank told NewsGuard that although the nonprofit does not seek out money from foundations or corporations, “we have received these in the past, unsolicited.” He said that a $25,000 donation from Craigslist is “probably the largest we’ve gotten in years.”</p>\n<p>Frank said that most contributions come from small donors, “averaging $25 a pop” and added that “we are a non-profit, so our tax returns are publicly available.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Ken Silverstein, an investigative journalist who had worked at high-profile media outlets including Harper’s Bazaar and the Los Angeles Times, founded CounterPunch as a newsletter in 1993. He left the publication in 1996. In 2012, CounterPoint launched its current magazine format.</p>\n<p>After Silverstein’s departure, current CounterPunch Editor Jeffrey St. Clair co-edited the publication with Alexander Cockburn, a well-known columnist for publications including The Village Voice, The Nation, and The Wall Street Journal, until Cockburn’s death in 2012.</p>\n<p>The CounterPunch.org domain name was created in 1998.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEdith Honan\n\nEdited by:\nMelissa Goldin&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership &#x26;
