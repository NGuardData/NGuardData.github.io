Raw Story Media also owns rawstory.com, a liberal news website, and The New Civil Rights Movement, an LGBT advocacy group. John Byrne, founder, chairman, and CEO of AlterNet, told NewsGuard in an email that he and vice chairman Michael Rogers are the owners of AlterNet. A<strong>l</strong>though the site does not disclose detailed financial information, Byrne told NewsGuard that nearly all of AlterNet’s revenue comes from advertising. “Less than 1 percent” of AlterNet’s budget comes from donations to The New Civil Rights Movement, Byrne said. </p>\n<p>AlterNet will soon offer paid subscriptions for an ad-free version of the site, Byrne said.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>AlterNet posts news and commentary articles that cover the economy, politics and the environment, among other issues. Some articles are original to AlterNet, while others are republished from sites such as Raw Story, Salon, Daily Kos, and The Conversation. Writers can also submit content to the site via a story submission email address. Submissions are reviewed, and stories are fact-checked if they are chosen for publication, according to Byrne. He also told NewsGuard that AlterNet will research writers before using their submissions, and typically only work with established freelancers.</p>\n<p>The site’s About page states that AlterNet aims to “confront the failures of corporate media, as well as the vitriol and disinformation of right wing media, especially ‘hate talk’ media.” A main section of the site is titled “Trump Trauma,” with stories such as “This Liberal Went to a Right-Wing Candidate Forum and Saw a Dangerous Alternate Reality” in May 2018.</p>\n<p>AlterNet also said it hopes to “inspire action … on the environment, human rights and civil liberties, social justice, media, health care issues, and more.”  It says it endeavors to provide its readers with “pathways to action” by informing readers of petitions, campaigns, and events.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Most stories on the site are thoroughly sourced, attributing images to their owners and linking to multiple original sources of information, where applicable.</p>\n<p>AlterNet’s coverage reflects a liberal perspective. </p>\n<p>Coverage ranges from straightforward news reports, such as the August 2018 piece “Monsanto Ordered to Pay Massive Financial Damages to Groundskeeper Who Said Roundup Gave Him Deadly Cancer,” to opinionated stories, such as the August 2018 list “Here Are 5 of the Most Disturbing Foreign-Policy Blunders of the Trump Era.” Although AlterNet does not regularly misstate facts when presenting opinions, its content is not clearly labeled as either news or opinion throughout, which is why NewsGuard determined AlterNet does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. Byrne told NewsGuard that the site plans to start tagging stories as “opinion” or “commentary” later in 2018, as it transitions to a new web platform. </p>\n<p>A link at the bottom of all stories encourages readers to report typographical errors and mistakes.  When an issue is reported, AlterNet issues a correction and updates the original article with an editor’s note. Headlines represent the content of their stories, although they are sensationalized at times (“‘Panicked’ Trump Roundly Mocked After Parroting Fox News Conspiracy Theory in Unhinged Monday Morning Meltdown”).</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>A Who We Are section discloses that AlterNet is owned by AlterNet Media Inc., listing its office street address. The page also names AlterNet’s staff and provides a biography for each staff member. Articles usually contain bylines linking to a page containing the author’s Twitter contact information and sometimes a short biography. The Contact page also enables users to submit questions or suggestions, and the Press Information page provides contact information for its publisher, Roxanne Cooper. Advertisements are clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Independent Media Institute, a nonprofit organization, launched AlterNet in 1998 to syndicate liberal articles and commentary. Raw Story Media Inc. acquired AlterNet in April 2018 as AlterNet Media, Inc., but has stated that it will maintain AlterNet’s mission.</p>\n<p>Don Hazen, a former executive editor of AlterNet, was placed on “indefinite leave” in 2017 after five women accused him of sexual harassment.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/about/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.alternet.org/about/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/PressRelease.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.alternet.org/PressRelease.pdf</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/writer-guidelines\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.alternet.org/writer-guidelines</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/liberal-went-right-wing-candidate-forum-and-saw-dangerous-alternate-reality\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/liberal-went-right-wing-candidate-forum-and-saw-dangerous-alternate-reality</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/animal-rights/10-terrible-things-dairy-industry-doesnt-want-you-know-about-your-milk-cheese-butter\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.alternet.org/animal-rights/10-terrible-things-dairy-industry-doesnt-want-you-know-about-your-milk-cheese-butter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/election-2012/correction-gun-owners-shoot-illegal-voters-hoax\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.alternet.org/election-2012/correction-gun-owners-shoot-illegal-voters-hoax</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/march-science-being-transformed-indigenous-knowledge\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/march-science-being-transformed-indigenous-knowledge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/cory-booker-tied-jared-kushner\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/cory-booker-tied-jared-kushner</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://archive.is/Aa0Lv#selection-353.0-366.0\" target=\"_blank\">http://archive.is/Aa0Lv#selection-353.0-366.0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cory-booker-jared-kushner/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cory-booker-jared-kushner/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/monsanto-ordered-pay-massive-financial-damages-groundskeeper-who-said-roundup-gave\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/monsanto-ordered-pay-massive-financial-damages-groundskeeper-who-said-roundup-gave</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/here-are-5-most-disturbing-foreign-policy-blunders-trump-era\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/here-are-5-most-disturbing-foreign-policy-blunders-trump-era</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/staff\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.alternet.org/staff</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/feedback\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.alternet.org/feedback</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/staff\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.alternet.org/staff</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/authors/elizabeth-preza\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.alternet.org/authors/elizabeth-preza</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/AlterNetNews/about/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pg/AlterNetNews/about/?ref=page_internal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/raw-story-partners-announce-acquisition-of-alternetorg-and-the-new-civil-rights-movement-300628299.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/raw-story-partners-announce-acquisition-of-alternetorg-and-the-new-civil-rights-movement-300628299.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/about-our-company/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.rawstory.com/about-our-company/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/366117-left-leaning-media-exec-on-indefinite-leave-over-sexual-harassment\" target=\"_blank\">http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/366117-left-leaning-media-exec-on-indefinite-leave-over-sexual-harassment</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"alternet.org","author":"Sarah Brandt","date":"2018-08-28T19:44:27.079+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/alternet.org/"}}
