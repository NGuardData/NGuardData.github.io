The website’s About page states, “we do our best to take down idiocy on both sides of the political spectrum, although we are decidedly left leaning. We provide well-researched, witty analysis to keep our readers sane.” </p>\n<p>Articles are generally not based on original reporting and quote from other news sources. The site divides its content into sections including Culture, News, Media, Sports, Politics, and Opinion, although articles in every section include some commentary. Stories on a typical day might include articles such as “Terrified of the Blue Wave, Georgia Republicans Shut down 75% of Black Voting Sites,” “Omarosa’s Claims Ring True Because Trump is an A**hole and We All Know It,” and “Robert Mueller Must Subpoena Donald Trump.” The Sports section features political stories, such as “The Reason Why Trump Attacks NFL Players Is Worse Than Racism” and “Serena Williams: Summer Of Sexism, Racism, And Her Humanity.”</p>\n<p>The site allows readers to purchase a paid membership to The Daily Banter, inviting users to “Join the Resistance” and get unlimited access to articles labeled “Members Only.” It has also posted stories, labeled as “Activism,” that offer advice to help advance Democratic and liberal goals, such as “Here Are 6 Ways You Can Help In the 2018 Midterms.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles on The Daily Banter consistently present liberal political opinions, criticizing conservatives, Republican politicians, and the Trump administration. For example, an October 2018 article titled “Dear Republican Voters: Stop Blaming the Left. You're Trash. Own It” addresses Republican voters directly, stating “Every last one of you is a f---ing liar.” Another October 2018 article, “Don't Underestimate The Rage Of The Red Hats,” describes supporters of President Donald Trump as “googly-eyed cult followers,” “brainwashed,” “lizard brains” and “a movement based on recklessness, deception, and grievances.” </p>\n<p>In November and December 2018, The Daily Banter made changes to the way it labeled its content, in response to a determination by NewsGuard that the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. The site added “Opinion” designators to more of its content, including most of a section that had been called “Politics,” and designated some stories as “News,” which Cohen told NewsGuard would consist of “only hard news stories (with no opinion).” </p>\n<p>In several other cases, the site added a lighter-colored “Opinion” stamp to stories that carried other labels, such as “Politics” or “Culture.” In at least one case, the website labeled a story both as “News” and “Opinion.”</p>\n<p>Cohen told NewsGuard that the site had labeled any story that contains opinion, even articles that primarily cover breaking news, he said, “so that there can be no confusion whatsoever. We cover events live and often inject opinion into our stories, so I believe this is the best way to be completely clear about what we are doing, while indicating the stories are time sensitive.”</p>\n<p>Upon further review, NewsGuard has determined that the site still does not meet the standard for handling the difference between news and opinion responsibly, finding that the Daily Banter’s news stories frequently add the author’s opinion. </p>\n<p>For example, a November 2018 story that referred to a New York Times report on Facebook’s response to investigations into misinformation shared on the platform, referred to a firm hired by Facebook that alleged that liberal philanthropist George Soros was behind negative stories about Facebook. The story’s author wrote, “Anti-Soros attacks are bread and butter for conservatives the world over and double as code for antisemitism.”  Other opinionated stories still appear in sections such as Media and Culture, including the article “11 Dead Jews And We’re Still Pretending Right-Wing Terrorism Doesn’t Exist,” following the mass shooting in October 2018 at a Pittsburgh synagogue.</p>\n<p>In addition, some Daily Banter stories are based on unreliable sources and stray beyond the facts to support the site’s stated perspective, which is why NewsGuard has also determined the site does not gather and information responsibly.</p>\n<p>For example, a November 2018 story, headlined “Evangelicals Won’t Care About Trump’s Alleged 8 Secret Abortions,” cites a “rumor,” attributed to an unnamed source in another publication, that President Donald Trump had paid eight women to have abortions and to sign nondisclosure agreements. The Daily Banter article, and the publication it based its report on, Spectator.us, provided no evidence, and no interviews with named individuals, to back that assertion. </p>\n<p>Cohen responded that the writer of the article did not “make any claim or say that the allegations are proven. It’s a hypothetical opinion piece with the word “alleged” in the headline.” </p>\n<p>In December 2018, the site published a story headlined “Robert Reich: Republicans Are Preparing to Join Democrats and “Pull the Trigger” on Impeachment,” which was labeled as both news and opinion. The story quoted from a Facebook post of the ex-Labor Secretary that included excerpts of a purported conversation with an unnamed, former Republican member of Congress. The article’s author analyzed the impact of the unidentified source’s comments, while appearing to acknowledge that the analysis is based on an account that may not be accurate. “Even if this is not a word for word accounting of the conversation, the overall theme and gist will be accurate,” the article states. The article ends, “Robert Reich’s post is just hearsay. For now.” </p>\n<p>Cohen told NewsGuard that he would evaluate the Reich article, although he did not see any immediate problems with it.</p>\n<p>The site has also published misleading and sensational headlines. For example, one October 2018 article was headlined “New Report Reveals Trump Doesn't Actually Do Any Work.” The article, however, reports that Trump spends three hours a day making appearances, attending official meetings and policy briefings. Cohen told NewsGuard that the headline was “very clearly tongue in cheek.” </p>\n<p>Another October 2018 article, “The Media Yawns At Political Assassination Attempts Now?” accuses several news outlets of being “willing accomplice[s] to right-wing violence.” The article is based on the fact that a New York Times article about a bomb mailed to Soros was “buried more than halfway down the front page” of its homepage. In fact, news of the explosive devices sent to Soros and others in October 2018 was covered extensively by most mainstream news organizations. </p>\n<p>Cohen told NewsGuard, “The article makes clear that the press is a “willing accomplice” to right wing violence by not covering it with the same fervor as they do left wing violence. It’s a provocative statement, but that’s sort of the point.”</p>\n<p>The Daily Banter publishes regular corrections to errors, explaining the error and the change in italicized notes. Its About page includes a corrections policy that pledges to attach notations to articles that have been changed. “We pledge to retract articles upon editorial review if the premise of the article is egregious,” the policy states.</p>\n<p>The site issued corrections to misstatements, pointed out in 2018 by NewsGuard, that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was a “known sexual assaulter,” another statement that the Republican party supports the candidacy of “rapists” for the Supreme Court, and another claim that terrorist attacks in the U.S. “are always committed by men.” </p>\n<p>Cohen told NewsGuard after the initial Nutrition Label rating of The Daily Banter was published that the review, “is, in my opinion, a deeply unfair assessment of our site and the work we do. We strive to be extremely accurate, and correct any legitimate mistakes promptly, as we have done in accordance to some of your criticisms.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Thedailybanter.com identifies Cohen as the site’s owner and editor in chief on its About page. The About page links to biographies, and occasional social media contact information, for Cohen and full-time writers. </p>\n<p>The site’s Contact page also lists Cohen’s email. Articles name the writer and link to biographical information. Advertisements are distinguished from news content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Daily Banter’s About page notes that it was founded by editor Cohen in 2007 in opposition to “the corporate news covering politics like a horse race.”</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This Nutriti</em><em>on Label has been updated to reflect new examples of content on the site, changes to the way the website labels some of its content, new published corrections, a new disclosure of the website’s political ideology, and additional comments from the site’s owner. Its rating has also changed to reflect that the website now discloses its ownership.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label referred to an article that appeared in a “News” section, a section which at at the time did not exist. The site has since begun to post some articles it labels as “News.”</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBron Maher\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Amy
