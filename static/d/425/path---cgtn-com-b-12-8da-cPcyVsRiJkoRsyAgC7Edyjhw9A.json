China Media Group was established in March 2018 as a state-owned media conglomerate overseeing CCTV, China National Radio, and China Radio International. In April 2018, Foreign Policy magazine wrote that the establishment of China Media Group was China’s “latest move in a global $6.6 billion media expansion campaign involving TV, radio, and newspapers that started in 2009.” The president of China Media Group, Shen Haixiong, previously served as chief of Guangdong’s provincial propaganda department.</p>\n<p>The site does not run advertising and is free to access.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>CGTN writes on its about page that “we cover the whole globe, reporting news from a Chinese perspective,” without explicitly disclosing that it is operated by the government of China. Announcing the formation of China Media Group, Chinese state news agency Xinhua wrote that the Group would be tasked with \"propagating the [Chinese Communist] party's theories, directions, principles and policies\" and \"telling good China stories.”</p>\n<p>The site’s sections include China, World, Politics, Business, Tech &#x26; Sci, and Culture &#x26; Sports. Articles often focus on world news or on diplomatic and domestic developments in China. Typical headlines have included, “China shows interest in Tajikistan's agricultural products;” “Britain's May under mounting pressure over Brexit plan;” and “Chinese ambassador dismisses as 'groundless' US accusation Beijing interfering in domestic affairs.” </p>\n<p>Internationally focused articles on cgtn.com are often republished from news agencies, including Reuters and the Chinese state-owned agency Xinhua. Cgtn.com hosts a Video section containing clips (with English subtitles) from its TV broadcasts and features an opinion section.</p>\n<p>PBS reported in March 2012 that in 2011, then-CCTV president Hu Zhanfan told an assembly of China’s National Media Association: \"The first social responsibility and professional ethic of media staff should be understanding their role clearly and being a good mouthpiece.” Writing for chinamediaproject.org in January 2017, Hong Kong-based journalist David Bandurski described stories on CGTN as “betraying that all-too-familiar habit state media have of reporting the news as though interesting and significant things are done only by Party and government leaders.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>CGTN reporters conduct original reporting intended for television broadcast, so stories on cgtn.com often prominently feature video clips from the CGTN television channel. When relying on other outlets, articles on cgtn.com credit their sources -- most often, Reuters, Xinhua, or The Associated Press -- but rarely contain any links to other sites. Headlines accurately represent content.</p>\n<p>CGTN writes on its About Us page that “Ultimately, we believe facts should speak for themselves and are committed to neutral, objective reporting.” However, although CGTN stories often take a neutral tone, they persistently promote the actions and interests of the Chinese government, ignore stories that might be unflattering to it, and focus on events that make China’s rivals look bad. Examples of such articles on the site in October 2018 included “China's central [state owned enterprises] continue rapid revenue growth;” “Bridgewater warns US economy faces looming deceleration;” and “China launches a pair of BeiDou-3 satellites.”</p>\n<p>One featured section on cgtn.com is titled “New Era For China” and is devoted to highlighting the Chinese government’s successes. Articles in the section include “A Remarkable Year in Fighting Corruption;” “A Remarkable Year in Military Affairs;” and “A Remarkable Year in Poverty Alleviation;” The section is introduced with a 10-minute video in which Chinese President Xi Xinping lists China’s accomplishments in 2017.</p>\n<p>Unflattering content about China is absent from cgtn.com. On Tibet -- a region many considered to have been annexed by China in 1951 -- typical headlines include “Better quality of life as Tibet celebrates 66th anniversary of peaceful liberation” (May 2017) and “True religious freedom in today’s Tibet” (April 2018.)  The European Union Parliament, the U.S. State Department, and Human Rights Watch have all criticized China for alleged repression of Tibetans.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the site’s coverage of China’s western Xinjiang region and its native Uyghur population consists largely of light human-interest articles or stories about China’s action on terrorism in the region. The site contains no information about what may be the most newsworthy issue involving Xinjiang: The alleged detention of between 600,000 and 1.2 million Uyghurs in political re-education camps.</p>\n<p>Because cgtn.com is a propaganda site aimed at bolstering China, downplaying its problems, and presenting China’s rivals in a negative light, NewsGuard has determined that it does not gather and present news responsibly.  </p>\n<p>Despite having an opinion section, opinionated content routinely appears in cgtn.com’s news sections, such as the October 2018 articles “US paranoia against China over spying” and “The contradictions in Trump's Taiwan policy,” which laments “America’s meddling” over Taiwan.</p>\n<p>Because cgtn.com does not label opinion content that appears in the news sections, and runs opinion articles that invariably omit information that may reflect negatively on China, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>The site does not appear to publish corrections or feature a stated corrections policy.</p>\n<p>Marcus Ryder, CGTN chief international editor, declined to comment on NewsGaurd’s questions about the site’s editorial standards -- including its mixing of news and opinion and lack of corrections -- but said that he would pass NewsGuard’s questions to a CGTN spokesperson. NewsGuard has not received a response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Cgtn.com’s About Us page describes the organization as “China’s new international media organization” and discloses that “It was launched by the national broadcaster China Central Television.” That CGTN is a government-owned and -operated news outlet is not explicitly disclosed. Similarly, CCTV’s website does not explicitly inform readers that it is an organ of the Chinese government.</p>\n<p>Because of CGTN’s vague description of its ownership and its role as a propaganda outlet for the Chinese government, NewsGuard has determined that cgtn.com fails to adequately disclose its ownership and conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>Articles on cgtn.com sometimes name their authors, but do not include contact details. The website’s About Us page features a “Faces of CGTN” page that names and provides biographical information about several CGTN anchors, reporters, producers, and editors, but many content creators are not included. The site does not give contact or biographical information for the people in charge, listing only a general email address and a street address.  </p>\n<p>Ryder, the CGTN international editor, declined to comment on NewsGuard’s questions about the site’s lack of disclosure about its ownership, leadership, and content creators, but said that he would pass NewsGuard’s questions to a CGTN spokesperson. NewsGuard has not received a response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>CGTN was launched in December 2016 as a centralized replacement to CCTV’s international stations. When the network launched, it published a letter from Chinese President Xi Jinping saying that he hoped that CGTN would “tell China’s story well, spread China’s voice well, let the world know a three-dimensional, colorful China, and showcase China’s role as a builder of world peace. “</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBron Maher\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Eric
