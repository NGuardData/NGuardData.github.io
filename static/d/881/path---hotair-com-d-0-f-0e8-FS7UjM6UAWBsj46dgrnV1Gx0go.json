The headlines link to excerpts from the stories.</p>\n<p>The rest of the site is devoted to its own content, which mostly consists of conservative-leaning opinion and analysis, framed around excerpts of other news outlets’ reporting. Typical articles comment on gun rights issues, immigration, U.S. President Trump, Brexit, cable television news, and the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, with a smattering of pop-culture content.</p>\n<p>Hot Air also features a twice-weekly radio talk show hosted by Ed Morrissey, one of the site’s editors and contributors. Listeners can comment through a live chat room and on the site’s Facebook page.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Hot Air publishes analysis and commentary, not original reporting. Its articles link to the source material referenced by its writers — typically reporting produced by other news outlets, press releases, and social media posts.</p>\n<p>Hot Air discloses its conservative orientation on its Facebook page, describing itself as “Conservative America’s Pithy Punditry.” However, Hot Air does not disclose its viewpoint on the site itself, even though most of its stories present conservative points of view.</p>\n<p>Articles on the site are overwhelmingly favorable toward Republicans and conservatives and critical of Democrats and liberals. The site also is consistently supportive of gun rights (“Maryland’s ‘Red Flag Law’ Claims Its First Victim As Police Kill Gun Owner,” from November 2018);  strict border enforcement (“Ninth Circuit Fully Beclowns Itself On Illegal Immigration,” December 2018); and tax cuts (“As Predicted, GOP Tax Cuts Prompt Record Tax Revenues,” November 2018). </p>\n<p>Because HotAir.com does not disclose a political or ideological orientation, yet selects stories that advance conservative perspectives, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>“Our site almost exclusively features commentary and analysis, not first-person beat reporting,” Hot Air senior editor Ed Morrissey told NewsGuard in an email. “Hot Air was created as part of the conservative blogosphere in 2006, and no one had any doubt about its purpose and mission as a conservative opinion/analysis site from its launch. While the market has changed in online commentary, we have never known of any confusion regarding our mission or purpose.”</p>\n<p>Hotair.com does not articulate a corrections policy, and NewsGuard found only one example of a corrected article on the site from the past year, which was not clearly marked as a correction. </p>\n<p>Asked about the site’s approach to corrections, Morrissey said, “On the rare occasions where our writers make an error of substance, we expect them to correct it and note that the correction has taken place within the body of the same article in which the error occurred.” He added that depending on the importance of the error, the correction “will be added to the bottom or the top of the article.”  </p>\n<p>However, he provided no examples of such corrections.</p>\n<p>Images on the site are not credited or captioned, which can occasionally mislead. For example, a November 2018 story headlined “Well, Look Who Was Sneaking Into The US With The Caravan,” was accompanied by a close-up image of a man whose face, head, and neck are covered in tattoos that say “MS,” “13,” and “Mara Salvatrucha,” which is the full name of the MS-13 gang. However, the photograph was not of the man in the story; it was an image taken by an Associated Press photographer in 2012 of a gang member inside a prison in El Salvador, according to captions of the same image that ran on stories published by the Voice of America and National Public Radio, among other outlets.</p>\n<p>Morrissey did not respond to NewsGuard’s question about the photo.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard did not find other examples of such misleading content, which is why the site was deemed to meet the standard for gathering and presenting news responsibly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Short biographies of Hot Air’s four editors are provided on the site’s About page. However, one of the site’s senior editors and primary contributors is only identified by the pseudonym “Allahpundit,” and no biographies or contact information for other contributors are available. Therefore, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not meet the standard for disclosing information about content creators. </p>\n<p>Asked about this, Morrissey noted that the site provides biographies of editors, who write much of the content.</p>\n<p>Hot Air’s About page lists Jon Garthwaite as General Manager of Townhall Media and provides a link to his Twitter profile. The site’s About page states that it is “part of” Townhall Media. But the site does not disclose that it is owned by Salem Media Group, which is mentioned only in small copyright language at the bottom of the site — which does not meet NewsGuard’s standard for clearly disclosing ownership. </p>\n<p>“On pages at Hot Air, the site’s ownership by Townhall Media Group (TMG) and Salem Media is clearly and appropriately identified in the footer,” Morrissey said. </p>\n<p>Advertising and sponsored content is distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>HotAir.com was founded in 2006 as a political blog by Michelle Malkin, a conservative commentator and syndicated columnist. Malkin sold the site to Salem Media Group in 2010.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nYemile Bucay\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric
