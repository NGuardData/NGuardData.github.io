Its other prominent newspaper brands include the Houston Chronicle, the San Francisco Chronicle, and the Albany Times-Union. Hearst generates revenue from advertising and subscriptions to its printed and digital products.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>A small staff of journalists creates news and feature articles and videos about the Seattle, Washington, area. Content is also provided by other Hearst outlets and The Associated Press.</p>\n<p>The site organizes content by several tabs, including Business, Sports, Travel, and Real Estate.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles on the site are balanced and well-sourced. Headlines are measured and accurately reflect the content. Text and video content is attributed either to the site’s staff journalists or to a third-party content provider. The site does not articulate a corrections policy, but articles that contained errors are published under a Correction heading, and the error is described. The site separates opinion from news content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Reporters and editors are listed on the site, along with brief biographies and contact information, including email addresses, social media handles, and telephone numbers. The site identifies and provides contact information for managers, and solicits user feedback. Advertising and sponsored content are clearly labeled. Hearst’s ownership is disclosed, and the site includes a detailed history of the Post Intelligencer.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The outlet traces its history to 1863, when Seattle entrepreneur J.R. Watson founded The Gazette, which later became the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Hearst purchased the newspaper in 1921. Seattlepi.com served as the online presence of The Seattle Post-Intelligencer. The paper ceased publishing in 2009, converting to an online-only news service. The site said the transition marked “the first major metro daily newspaper to go online-only.” The website was registered in 1999.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nDan Cook\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.seattlepi.com/facts/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattlepi.com/facts/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/business/media/10paper.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/business/media/10paper.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.seattlepi.com/sports/seahawks/article/Kam-Chancellor-announces-retirement-from-football-13042036.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattlepi.com/sports/seahawks/article/Kam-Chancellor-announces-retirement-from-football-13042036.php</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.seattlepi.com/news/world/article/The-Latest-German-interior-min-talks-migrants-13050535.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattlepi.com/news/world/article/The-Latest-German-interior-min-talks-migrants-13050535.php</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.seattlepi.com/local/komo/article/Firefighters-battle-huge-warehouse-fire-south-of-13050279.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattlepi.com/local/komo/article/Firefighters-battle-huge-warehouse-fire-south-of-13050279.php</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.seattlepi.com/sports/seahawks/article/Kam-Chancellor-announces-retirement-from-football-13042036.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattlepi.com/sports/seahawks/article/Kam-Chancellor-announces-retirement-from-football-13042036.php</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.seattlepi.com/author/zosha-millman/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattlepi.com/author/zosha-millman/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.seattlepi.com/facts/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattlepi.com/facts/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.seattlepi.com/pistaff/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattlepi.com/pistaff/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.seattlepi.com/facts/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattlepi.com/facts/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Seattle-P-I-to-publish-last-edition-Tuesday-1302597.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Seattle-P-I-to-publish-last-edition-Tuesday-1302597.php</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.seattlepi.com/aboutus/article/seattlepi-com-history-2274626.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.seattlepi.com/aboutus/article/seattlepi-com-history-2274626.php</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/business/media/10paper.htmlc\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/business/media/10paper.htmlc</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"seattlepi.com","author":"Dan Cook","date":"2018-08-17T10:44:53.301+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/seattlepi.com/"}}
