Originally named YearlyKos, Netroots Nation has been dubbed by HuffPost as “The Nation’s Largest Progressive Gathering.” </p>\n<p>Daily Kos derives revenue from advertisements and subscriptions to an ad-free version of the site.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Daily Kos features stories covering a range of issues relevant to progressive causes through two forms of content: articles and podcasts created by staff journalists, labeled “Daily Kos Staff”; and unedited articles posted by its network of independent contributors, including high-profile figures such as former Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Jimmy Carter, which are labeled “Community.” </p>\n<p>Executive Editor Susan Gardner told NewsGuard in a phone call that approximately 75 percent of articles on the site are written by its Community members, rather than its staff journalists.</p>\n<p>Daily Kos Staff and Community posts typically aggregate reporting from other news sources, sometimes feature original reporting, and are often written in blunt, emotive language. Posts frequently contain commentary critical of conservative causes or favorable toward liberal ones. For example, one of the most shared articles in January 2019, according to data from internet analytics company NewsWhip, described former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan as “approximately as popular as ebola-flavored breakfast cereal.” Another popular post in January 2019 was headlined, “Lying yet again, Sarah Huckabee Sanders gets her clock cleaned by Fox News' Chris Wallace.”</p>\n<p>The site features extensive coverage of politics and elections. During presidential election years, Daily Kos publishes the results of its nonscientific straw polls, which gauge its members’ views on potential candidates.</p>\n<p>The site features an Action section, which contains petitions, political endorsements, and fundraising appeals. Daily Kos has raised millions for Democratic candidates, including more than $1 million for Jon Ossoff, the Georgia Democratic candidate who ultimately lost to his Republican opponent in a 2017 special Congressional election, according to press accounts.</p>\n<p>Daily Kos articles’ comments sections are often robust and extensive.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Stories by Daily Kos staff typically cite and link to original research and credible news sources, such as NBC News and the Washington Post. The site’s elections coverage is well-regarded and includes original data compilations and analyses that are often quoted by major news organizations. Its straw polls are widely cited as an indication of how candidates and issues are playing on the left.</p>\n<p>Although headlines are sometimes overheated — such as “Traitor Trump's week has gone from unbearable to nightmarish” — they accurately represent the content and are not deceptive or misleading.</p>\n<p>Daily Kos editors do not regularly vet Community stories — which are produced by independent, sometimes anonymous, contributors — for quality and accuracy. These unvetted articles  — which Gardner estimated account for approximately three quarters of the website’s content — contain a disclaimer below the headline that reads: “Community (This content is not subject to review by Daily Kos staff).” The disclaimer was added in December 2018, after the previous version of this Nutrition Label was published.</p>\n<p>The site’s founder, Markos Moulitsas, told NewsGuard in a phone call that Daily Kos editors occasionally select Community articles to run on the site’s homepage. Those posts are edited, attributed to the author using his or her legal name, and run without the disclaimer, Moulitsas said.  </p>\n<p>Although anyone can create an account and post a story without providing their legal name, Daily Kos articulates safeguards meant to maintain a standard of accuracy. The site’s “Rules of the Road” page lists more than 30 guidelines for Community posts, urging users, for example, to cite credible sources, include firsthand accounts, and not promote conspiracy theories. Moulitsas told NewsGuard that the site employs a team of moderators that monitors community posts, taking down those that contain spam or flagrant falsehoods. Daily Kos also relies on its community of users to moderate the content of such posts, he said.</p>\n<p>“Our community is insistent on being accurate,” Moulitsas asserted. “What usually happens is, when someone gets something really wrong, they're embarrassed and delete it. If the community doesn’t force a correction or force a piece to be deleted, our moderation crew is empowered to delete it.”</p>\n<p>Daily Kos corrects staff articles by updating the article and explaining, typcially in a parenthetical note within the story, what had been corrected. As for Community posts, it is left to the contributors to correct any errors, Moulitsas said. When the site’s editors and moderators identify falsehoods in community articles, Moulitsas said, they can delete the article, and the site does not post a correction or a retraction notice. </p>\n<p>Because of the site’s policy of sometimes deleting false articles without disclosing the mistake to readers and the limited corrections for the site’s Community content, NewsGuard has determined that Daily Kos does not meet its standard for regularly and transparently correcting errors.</p>\n<p>“There is a very functional community moderating system, and most of the time it works,” Moulitsas said. “I’d say 99.99 percent of time it works, and when it doesn’t, that is when our moderators step in.”</p>\n<p>NewsGuard acknowledges that Daily Kos’s addition of a disclosure stating that contributor articles are not vetted brings the site closer to presenting information responsibly. However, because the site enables anyone to create an account and post unvetted articles, without requiring they provide a legal name, NewsGuard has concluded Daily Kos does not meet its standard for gathering information responsibly.</p>\n<p>Although the site is upfront about its political orientation, stating in its “Rules of the Road” that “this is a site for Democrats,” it publishes strongly opinionated articles in a section titled News. Clicking the News tab leads to articles that have included statements such as “The best thing that can be said about Donald Trump’s State of the Union address is that it was completely lacking in ideas, with no vision at all for the nation’s future” and “This morning, Donald Trump—the common thread in numerous criminal investigations—used Twitter to unleash a heap of steaming hot garbage.”</p>\n<p>Because Daily Kos frequently includes commentary in stories presented as news, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>In a phone discussion about the site's blending of news and opinion, Moulitsas told NewsGuard: \"We're obviously an opinion site.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>An extensive masthead on the site names its editorial staff, providing a biography and photo for each individual. The biography for Moulitsas states that he runs Kos Media, LLC. Readers can submit general inquiries through a Contact Us page.</p>\n<p>Stories by Daily Kos staff include the author’s name and photo, linking to a profile page that often includes biographical and contact information and other articles by the same writer. Community posts are also bylined and link to a profile page, but sometimes give usernames rather than legal names and lack biographical information. </p>\n<p>Because of its use of pseudonyms, NewsGuard concluded the site does not provide adequate information about content creators. Moulitsas explained that this practice existed to protect its contributors from potential harassment.</p>\n<p>“What we do care is about accuracy and truth, not who some person in Lima, Ohio or San Antonio is,” Moulitsas told NewsGuard in an email. “I started Daily Kos under a pseudonym (Kos) in 2002 precisely because it was risky to be anti-war post 9-11. Me, an Army veteran in San Francisco, had to be careful writing against the war! [...] The reasons to publish pseudonymously today are just as compelling, if not more so, than the reasons people have done so for hundreds of years.”</p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Markos Moulitsas founded Daily Kos in 2002, after serving in the Army and graduating from law school. He named the site for his nickname, “Kos.” In 2003, Moulitsas cofounded SBNation, the sports news website that preceded Vox Media. Moulitsas has written columns for Newsweek and The Hill, and authored books including “Crashing the Gate: Netroots, Grassroots, and the Rise of People-Powered Politics” and “The Resistance Handbook: 45 Ways to Fight Trump.” </p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: After further review, NewsGuard has concluded Daily Kos does not meet its standard for regularly correcting errors and that it meets its standard for avoiding deceptive headlines.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a
