NBC owns other english-language stations in addition to a number of Telemundo properties around the U.S.</p>\n<p>MSNBC is financed by advertisements and by fees paid for distributing and licensing its content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>MSNBC.com publishes video clips and articles of news and liberal commentary from MSNBC and NBC News, covering politics, the economy, health, education, and other issues. </p>\n<p>Most of the site’s content consists of clips of MSNBC programs, frequently featuring its most popular and outspoken hosts, especially Rachel Maddow and Joe Scarborough of Morning Joe. The site also streams MSNBC audio and includes three sections containing photo galleries, in-depth multimedia articles, and web documentaries.</p>\n<p>Top stories often feature coverage and commentary critical of conservative policies and political figures. For example, on July 19, 2018, most stories in the Top Stories section dealt with Trump and his policies on immigration and national security, all of which portrayed the president in a negative light. </p>\n<p>The Donald Trump section of the site  -- one of its top features -- is frequently updated with stories critical of Trump. On July 20, 2018, the 25 most recent stories in the section, all from the previous two days, were critical of the President, his policies, and his administration. Headlines included “Trump embarrassed our country, says senator” and “Amateur Hour: Trump Makes his third walk-back on Russia in three days.”</p>\n<p>The site’s liberal perspective mirrors that of the cable channel, and is apparent in its reporting -- an assessment shared by news sources ranging from The New York Times and The Washington Post to Fox News. </p>\n<p>After years of low ratings, MSNBC found its niche as a liberal alternative to the conservative cable network Fox News. Its popularity has boomed in recent years, with its audience expanding more than 50 percent in 2017 and again in 2018. Its success has been largely attributed to the growing popularity of the Rachel Maddow show, described by Variety magazine as “adept at channeling the angst of the so-called resistance to Trump in liberal and progressive circles.” Other popular programs have contributed to the network’s success, particularly The Last Word With Lawrence O’Donnell, a liberal news and opinion show, and The 11th Hour with Brian Williams, a nightly news program.</p>\n<p>Neither MSNBC.com nor its programs outwardly describe themselves as liberal, and the website lacks any About page describing its mission or content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>MSNBC.com runs news stories and videos that are well-sourced, often featuring original reporting and interviews. Headlines offer straight descriptions of content without sensationalizing or embellishing. Much of the site’s news coverage comes from NBC News, which also produces original, breaking reports. Although videos from commentary programs, such as Maddow’s, skew left, news stories offer factual, balanced accounts of events.</p>\n<p>Where the network’s liberal slant is evident, however, is in the selection of stories it posts. MSNBC’s focus on topics unfavorable to conservatives, especially President Trump, results in a limited breadth of coverage. On June 18, 2018, for example, the sites homepage was almost entirely devoted to stories critical of the Trump administration’s policy of separating immigrant families (with headlines such as “Trump sees immigrant children as bargaining chips in political fight.”) At one point that same day, the homepage of The New York Times’ website contained only four stories covering the policy, by contrast.</p>\n<p>The network has received criticism for its credibility in the past, most recently related to two of its main program hosts, Joy-Ann Reid and Brian Williams.</p>\n<p>Williams joined MSNBC after being removed as anchor of NBC’s Nightly News program in 2015 for fabricating a story in which he claimed that he came under fire on a helicopter ride he took while covering the Iraq war in 2003. Williams apologized on NBC’s Today show in June 2015, toward the end of a six month suspension from NBC, stating “I am sorry for what happened. I am different as a result, and I expect to be held to a different standard.”</p>\n<p>Reid, host of the MSNBC show AM Joy, was criticized for old blog posts from between 2007 and 2009 that made homophobic statements, promoted a conspiracy theory about 911, and defamed Senator John McCain. Reid apologized, and the network issued a statement saying that Reid’s old posts “are not reflective of the colleague and friend we have known at MSNBC for the past seven years,” backing Reid’s assertions that she had “grown and evolved in the many years since.” In April 2018, more offensive old posts emerged. Reid again apologized, this time saying she did not believe she wrote them that and that she may have been hacked.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard judged MSNBC.com to be within the acceptable bounds of “handling the mix of news and opinion responsibly,” because the website presents news in a more straightforward manner than some of its highly opinionated and popular shows, and because it does not egregiously cherry pick news stories to fit the political stance of its evening show hosts.</p>\n<p>MSNBC.com does not list a policy or contact information for correcting errors, nor does it appear to regularly correct errors. NBC’s media relations department did not reply to two NewsGuard emails and a voicemail inquiring about its approach to corrections. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site notes its ownership by NBCUniversal at the bottom of the home page, linking to some of its affiliate news sites: Today.com, NBCNews.com, and CNBC.com. MSNBC.com does not provide centralized information about its staff, or about who is in charge of the operation, but does include pages for each of the network’s regular programs, which contain social media and staff information.</p>\n<p>Some stories include the name of the writer, linked to a biography, although many stories are  only attributed to the MSNBC cable program that produced the content, without naming the journalists involved.</p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored posts are distinguishable from the site’s news content.</p>\n<p>NBC’s media relations department did not reply to two NewsGuard emails and a voicemail inquiring about its lack of transparency about its editorial leadership.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Microsoft and NBC formed a partnership in 1996 to launch MSNBC and MSNBC.com. Initially, Microsoft operated the website while NBC operated the network. In 2005, NBC purchased Microsoft’s stake in MSNBC, but did not fully take over operation of the site until 2012. Comcast acquired NBCUniversal in 2011.</p>\n<p>In its early years, MSNBC presented itself as an alternative to CNN,<strong> </strong>described in a New Yorker profile as a “news-obsessed” network unlike its current opinion-driven format. MSNBC trailed behind CNN and Fox News for years as it struggled to find its niche. The network did not begin to adopt its current liberal identity until hiring Keith Olbermann as an anchor in 2003, who became known for his left-leaning monologues. MSNBC cemented its liberal orientation with the hiring of Rachel Maddow in 2008, whose popularity has grown, especially after the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n\nEdited by:\nGordon Crovitz&#x26;emsp;Steven Brill&#x26;emsp;Joyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;Eric
