The site is owned by Publius Press Inc., a small private publishing company in Lookout Mountain, Tennessee. Alexander appears to be a pseudonym: The site, its store, and its associated nonprofit are run by a Mark A. Caldwell. A Facebook profile for a Mark Caldwell includes photos of a man who appears to be the same person pictured in Mark Alexander’s biography on PatriotPost.Us. In an email NewsGuard asked Patriot Post “Is Mark Alexander the pen name of Mark Caldwell?” </p>\n<p>Alexander responded in an email. “Mark Caldwell is the owner of Publius Press, Inc. Most of our writers, including Mark Alexander, use pseudonyms for the reason we have stated on our About pages -- humility,” Alexander wrote. “We elected at our inception to be driven by ideas not personalities.”</p>\n<p>The Patriot Post receives revenue through donations, subscriptions, and online sales of products such as flags, pamphlets, posters, stickers and emergency preparedness kits. It does not accept advertising of any kind “to ensure our advocacy is not restrained by commercial influence,” according to the site’s homepage. </p>\n<p>Despite its donation-based business model, Patriot Post is legally a for-profit business. However, the site’s leadership also runs the Patriot Foundation Trust, a nonprofit organization devoted to developing and funding educational resources and opportunities that “promote and sustain the principles of American Liberty,” according to the Trust’s website.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site publishes conservative political opinion and analysis. It describes itself as “a leading advocate for individual rights and responsibilities, the restoration of constitutional limits on government and the judiciary, and promotion of free enterprise, national defense and traditional American values.” </p>\n<p>Stories cover the news of the day -- “NYT Publisher to Trump: Stop Being Divisive and Dangerous,” for example -- as well as cultural trends, such as an August 2018 story with the headline “Comedy Is Dead, And Leftists Murdered It.”  The site runs daily roundups of headlines and quotes from news figures, and its homepage features links to columns by syndicated conservative columnists under the label “The Right Opinion.” Featured “Right Opinion” columnists include Gary Bauer, Cal Thomas, Ann Coulter, Ben Shapiro, and Rich Lowry.</p>\n<p>The homepage also runseditorial cartoons and original memes and graphics. The site publishes posts centered on videos from third parties as well.</p>\n<p>The style and tone of patriotpost.us is a mix of high and low brow. It features Latin phrases and quotes from the Founding Fathers, and places a heavy emphasis on “personal liberty” and strict adherence to the Constitution. However, it is not above name-calling: a daily roundup of news quotes often declares a liberal either a “Braying Jackass” or a “Braying Jenny,” depending on his or her gender. On July 31, 2018 a meme on the homepage showed an image of a man saying that he “tried to look at things from a liberal perspective...but my head didn’t fit up my butt.” </p>\n<p>The site maintains digital copies of historical documents, a collection that covers a time period stretching from the Early Bronze Age (The Code of Hammurabi) to the early 21st century (the official platforms of the major U.S. political parties in the 2012 election.) It also has a database of quotes from the Founding Fathers. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site does not seem to conduct original reporting, nor does it contact the sources or subjects of articles. Instead, it publishes political and cultural commentary and analysis based on reporting from credible news outlets. It generally aggregates content from multiple sources. For example, an August 2, 2018 story titled “The ADA Is a Serial Litigator’s Dream” cited the Orange County Register, Courthouse News Service, Florida’s Sun Sentinel newspaper, The New York Post, The Hill, Govtrack.us (a website that tracks legislation), Rewire.news, Opensecrets.org, the text of a two U.S. Supreme court decisions, and an ADA advocacy group.    </p>\n<p>Headlines, while sometimes provocative, describe an article’s content accurately.</p>\n<p>The site runs corrections, but not frequently or regularly. NewsGuard found one post from January 2018 that indicated a story had been corrected, but not what had been corrected.  Corrections that do appear take the form of a line at the bottom of an article, indicating it had been updated. Alexander told Newsguard that most of the site's updates \"are not related to corrections but to the addition of supporting information, quotes, etc.\"</p>\n<p>However, when NewsGuard found a factual error in an August 1, 2018, Patriot Post promptly ran a correction. The story said “Jerry Seinfeld, the undisputed King of Comedy for a generation, quit stand-up comedy because progressives have sucked all of the joy out of it.” But when the story was published, Seinfeld was on a stand up comedy tour of North America. When NewsGuard notified Patriot Post of the inaccuracy, the site corrected its error within 24 hours and added a correction to the bottom of the story: “The original version of this analysis noted that Jerry Seinfeld ‘quit stand-up comedy.’ Stated correctly, he ‘quit stand-up comedy on college and university campuses’ as noted later in context.”</p>\n<p>Patriot Post acknowledged but did not answer a message and a follow-up email sent through its contact page asking about corrections.</p>\n<p>The site is not related to Patotriotpost.com, a purveyor of misinformation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site runs a biography of founder Mark Alexander, describing him as Executive Editor and Publisher. However, as noted, this is a pen name, according to Caldwell, who is the actual publisher. The site lists its reporters and editors on its Our Team page. It provides some trivia about each staff member (“Favorite Founder,” “Favorite Books,” “Weapon of Choice”), but very little biographical information, and no contact information or links to social media profiles. </p>\n<p>Citing “humility,” Alexander told NewsGuard in an email that “most” writers on the site use pseudonyms. “This is an unusual model in an age when so many news outlets are personality centric,” Alexander said.</p>\n<p>The only way to for readers to contact the site and its staffers is through a Contact Us form.</p>\n<p>The site also lists more than 60 members of its “National Advisory Committee.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site was founded in 1996 by “Mark Alexander” as an online-only conservative political news source. Then called The Federalist, the site represented Alexander’s conservative response to what he described as “the virtual monopoly the mainstream media held on public opinion.” He later renamed it Patriot Post.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nDan Cook\n\nEdited by:\nJosh Keefe&#x26;emsp;Joyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
