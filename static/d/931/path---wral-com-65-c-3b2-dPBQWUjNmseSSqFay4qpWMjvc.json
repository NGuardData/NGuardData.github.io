Privately owned CBC has two other North Carolina television stations (FOX affiliate WRAZ in Raleigh and the independent WLIM, in Wilmington), as well as nine radio stations in the area. It also owns American Underground, a subsidiary that underwrites new businesses in the area, and the Durham Bulls, a Triple-A minor league baseball team. Bulls games are broadcast on WRAZ.</p>\n<p>CBC also has several real estate holdings. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Wral.com focuses heavily on original coverage of local and state news, befitting Raleigh’s status as the state capitol.  Sports coverage is also extensive, with separate pages for hometown North Carolina State University, nearby Duke and East Carolina universities, and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.  Separate pages are devoted as well to the Carolina Hurricanes (NHL) and Panthers (NFL), high school sports, and the Durham Bulls, a minor league baseball team. A wralsportsfan.com link on the site offers additional sports coverage and podcasts, along with opinion columns under the heading “Our Take.” Coverage of weather, business, health, consumer issues, education and entertainment coverage run in individual sections. The opinion page includes editorial board pieces and guest submissions, as well as original editorial cartoons by Dennis Draughon, a fixture in North Carolina since the mid-1980s. A video page offers a broad range of stories supplementing written and photo content. The site also links to NBC-TV primetime, late night and other shows. A Spotlight section offers sponsored content on a range of topics. The website’s national and world news offerings are mainly from the Associated Press.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site’s content, headlines, and images are objective and fact-based, and opinion pieces are clearly marked. Requests for corrections are handled on a case-by-case basis. In some instances, when a reader seeks a correction and can provide supporting facts, the relevant story is amended with an editor’s note published at the top. But the site has no stated corrections policy and it does not regularly post corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The website clearly identifies station owner Capitol Broadcasting Company (CBC), and its About Us page links to an extensive list of news managers and staff, including nearly two dozen editors and reporters dedicated to digital news. Content creators may be reached only via a general form rather than through individual email addresses. The site’s Contact Us page lists the main newsroom telephone number.</p>\n<p>Stories on the site about American Underground (AU) disclose that it is a subsidiary of CBC. However, stories about companies that received support from AU, in the form of start-up financial investments and business resources, do not disclose that American Underground and the TV station have the same owner. Asked by NewsGuard whether WRAL was concerned about the perception of a conflict of interest, Judy Glusco, WRAL’s content director, said that the station is autonomous: “Our newsroom does not know or benefit from the relationships established by American Underground or other divisions of the company.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>WRAL-TV began broadcasting in 1956 as an NBC affiliate, later switching to ABC and then CBS; it is one of the few stations in the country to have been a primary affiliate of all of \"Big Three\" networks. The station switched back to NBC affiliation in 2016. The wral.com domain has been registered since 1997, but the station could not confirm whether the website was launched that year.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nPam Weber-Leaf\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Joyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.capitolbroadcasting.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.capitolbroadcasting.com/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://editorialcartoonists.com/cartoonist/profile.cfm/DraugD/\" target=\"_blank\">http://editorialcartoonists.com/cartoonist/profile.cfm/DraugD/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=https://www.wral.com/appeals-court-sends-back-case-of-youth-convicted-in-2-deaths/17523306/&source=gmail&ust=1528942675204000&usg=AFQjCNGvrglGAjyeZRbN_HP55poXvpRzFw\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&#x26;q=https://www.wral.com/appeals-court-sends-back-case-of-youth-convicted-in-2-deaths/17523306/&#x26;source=gmail&#x26;ust=1528942675204000&#x26;usg=AFQjCNGvrglGAjyeZRbN_HP55poXvpRzFw</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wral/\" target=\"_blank\">https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wral/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.capitolbroadcasting.com/divisions/real-estate/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.capitolbroadcasting.com/divisions/real-estate/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/28/durham-nc-sparks-a-tobacco-road-business-revival.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/28/durham-nc-sparks-a-tobacco-road-business-revival.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wral.com/triangle-organization-promotes-women-minorities-in-coding-industry/17598034/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wral.com/triangle-organization-promotes-women-minorities-in-coding-industry/17598034/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.codethedream.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.codethedream.org</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wral.com/news/video/15447333/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wral.com/news/video/15447333/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article55473790.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article55473790.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"wral.com","author":"Pam Weber-Leaf","date":"2018-08-21T15:12:53.768+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/wral.com/"}}
