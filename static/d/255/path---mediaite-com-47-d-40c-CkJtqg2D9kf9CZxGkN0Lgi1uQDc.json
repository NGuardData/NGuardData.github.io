Since then, the site has become one of three sites under the Abrams Media umbrella along with The Mary Sue and Lawandcrime.com (formerly LawNewz.com). Advertising is a primary source of revenue.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Much of Mediaite’s content summarizes interviews and news segments from television news programs, especially cable networks CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.</p>\n<p>The site publishes stories on media ethics, such as “White House Waives Ethics Rules to Let Bill Shine Communicate With Fox News, Larry Kudlow with CNBC.” It publishes some commentary on coverage, as it did in an August 2018 criticism of the media’s failure to hold Michael Avenatti, an attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels, accountable for his simultaneous courting of the media and interest in politics. Opinion stories like the Avenatti piece appear alongside news stories, and are only identified as such to users once they click on the headline.</p>\n<p>The site also publishes breaking political, entertainment, food, sports, and entertainment news.</p>\n<p>It publishes a small amount of original content, such as an August 2018 interview with HLN host and columnist S.E. Cupp.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Mediaite describes itself as “a trusted source on the intersection of politics and media across the political spectrum.” It has been accused of both liberal and conservative biases. In a 2015 post, Abrams called such claims “silly,” writing: “I have always attempted to encourage a mix of political views on the site and yet there is no question that with each different group​ of writers that equation shifts a bit. It’s impossible to be right down the middle, particularly on a site that encourages​​ ​opinion.”  </p>\n<p>The site has a featured opinion pieces from liberal and conservative perspectives. Former columnist A.J. Delgado worked as a senior adviser on President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>Some opinion authors contribute regular news articles to the site, and opinions are featured in some news coverage, particularly in stories that deal with Fox News.</p>\n<p>In three articles on Fox News in July and August 2018, writers described a “Fox &#x26; Friends” segment on North Korean propaganda as “having no discernible news value”; called for Fox reporter Peter Hegseth to be “banished back to [journalism] school”; and said Hegseth was “practically falling over himself to give [current Trump attorney Rudy] Giuliani an award in patience.”</p>\n<p>“Our idea is the website is supposed to be nonpartisan, but then again, not neutral,” Mediaite managing editor Aidan McLaughlin told NewsGuard in a telephone interview. “We want our stories to call stuff out and take sides between right and wrong.”  <br><br>Mediaite has allowed editorial staff members to use aliases. From 2013 to 2017, Mediaite’s managing editor was known as “Jon Nicosia.” In 2014, he admitted in a Mediaite post that his real name was Zachary Hildreth, explaining he adopted an alias to escape his past convictions for larceny, bank fraud and securities fraud. Hildreth left Mediaite in 2017.</p>\n<p>In 2012, conservative news site The Daily Caller reported Tommy Christopher was not the real name of Mediaite’s White House correspondent. Nando Di Fino, then-senior editor of Mediaite,  said he was aware of “Tommy Christopher” being an alias, which the writer had used in his previous reporting job at AOL’s Politics Daily. </p>\n<p>“Mediaite generally does not allow writers to use pseudonyms but in the nine years of the site's existence, the site has made two exceptions,” Mediaite said in an emailed statement to NewsGuard. “In both cases, the writer/editor came to us having already been regularly working under a particular name professionally, and we allowed them to continue to do so.”</p>\n<p>The site posts corrections to its stories at the bottom of articles disclosing the original error and what was changed.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The Contact Us page includes the site’s mailing address and email contacts for advertising, partnerships and news tips. Articles are credited to writers. The site’s About Us page lists the site’s staff and provides email addresses for everyone except Abrams. Abrams is the only staff member with a biography on the site. McLaughlin said readers can find more information about other writers by clicking through to Twitter accounts linked at the bottom of their articles.</p>\n<p>Abrams is clearly listed as founder and publisher, and Mediaite stories involving his other projects or his TV appearances mention his role with the site. However, because the site does not include a disclaimer disclosing Abrams’ ABC affiliation at the bottom of stories affecting ABC, NewsGuard determined that Mediaite does not adequately reveal who is in charge and possible conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>Abrams and McLaughlin said Abrams does not oversee the site’s editorial staff. Abrams told NewsGuard in an email that he does “regularly send story ideas” and is consulted by editors “on potential legal pitfalls and the possible ramifications” for certain stories.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: </em><em>“We have removed ‘But’ from in front of this last sentence because it does not contradict the previous sentence and unfairly implies that it does – and, therefore, implies that Mr. Abrams dictates stories. Mr. Abrams did tell us that his story suggestions are not necessarily acted on, and we should have included that or not written, ‘But.’”</em></p>\n<p>“The sites have published stories that not only I disagree with but that I would not have permitted to be published if I was editing,” Abrams said. “Certain stories Mediaite in particular has published have put great strain on some of my friendships and professional relationships. I say to them what I will say to you: it is the editors call not mine.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site was launched in 2009. In a Washington Post story about Mediaite’s launch, an unnamed former managing editor described it as \"Huffington Post meets Gawker” and Abrams said the site would feature “some jabs at people in the media, calling out hypocrisy and gaffes.”</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: Mediaite managing editor Aidan McLaughlin told NewsGuard that the site now has a policy of not allowing pseudonyms, and provides writers’ bylines, contact information, and social media handles. Therefore, NewsGuard has changed the “Provides information about content creators” criteria from a “No” to “Yes.”</em></p>\n<p><em>Disclosure: Dan Abrams worked as a legal commentator in the 1990s for Court TV, which was founded by NewsGuard co-CEO Steven Brill.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJohn Gregory\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Jim
