The site generates revenue through paid subscriptions and advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Talking Points Memo features breaking news, investigative reporting, and opinion pieces. It publishes longform stories, national and international coverage reported from Associated Press, and the “Josh Marshall Podcast,” created in February 2018 and featuring its founder and editor-in-chief. Subscribers have access to the “Hive,” a discussion forum for paid members.</p>\n<p>Talking Points Memo has a liberal slant in story selection. Coverage of President Donald Trump and those associated with him and his administration is consistently negative. This perspective is visible in news stories like a July 2018 article, “Sean Spicer Is Our Duke Of The Week.” The “Duke of the Week” refers to a weekly (prior to 2018, yearly) segment that “recognize[s] a politician who has distinguished themselves with an attention-grabbing display of corruption, abuse of power, or risible behavior.” The story on Spicer stated, “Noticing a sudden lack in invitations to make cringey jokes about his penchant for lying while riding around on a mobile White House press podium in front of America’s rich and famous, former press secretary Sean Spicer has found a new way to squander his dwindling, Anthony Scaramucci-level relevance in the political spotlight: He wrote a really bad book.”</p>\n<p>Talking Points Memo’s Editors’ Blog features members of the editorial staff, including Marshall, often expressing disapproval of Republicans and President Trump. A July 2018 post headlined “The Bigs Are Starting to Accept the Unimaginable” declared that “most respectable opinion in the U.S. has stood aghast at President Trump’s bizarre and often inexplicable actions” and asserted that “Putin must have something on Trump.” The blog takes on other subjects, including the media. On August 8th, 2018 Marshall responded to an insider trading indictment of Republican Rep. Chris Collins, an early Trump supporter, by deriding CNN’s coverage, in particular reporter Dana Bash for suggesting Trump was elected in response to popular unhappiness with such alleged behavior by Washington politicians. Marshall’s quick response was headlined, “Good Lord. Just Minutes in and We Already Have the Worst Take on Chris Collins. Trump is a Reaction to People Like Chris Collins!”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>News stories are often cherry-picked to support the site’s liberal perspective. NewsGuard reviewed two weeks’ worth of news coverage on August 13 2018 and found numerous examples of unfavorable stories about Republicans including President Donald Trump, Fox News commentator Laura Ingraham, and top White House aide Stephen Miller. NewsGuard could not find any stories written by Talking Points Memo staff members that praised Republican figures within this period. Because the site cherry-picks stories and does not acknowledge its liberal perspective in its About page or elsewhere, NewsGuard has judged that it does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. When asked the site’s perspective, founder and editor-in-chief Josh Marshall told NewsGuard in an email that “TPM has been in constant publication for almost 18 years, has won awards, broken stories, launched many careers. So I'm not really interested in justifying it or helping it navigate some obstacle course for certification.”</p>\n<p>In 2002, the site reported on controversial comments made by then-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Republican from Mississippi, who praised the 1948 presidential bid of then-segregationist Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. Criticism of the remarks by Talking Points Memo and others led to Lott’s resignation from his position as majority leader.</p>\n<p>Talking Points Memo won the 2007 George Polk Award for coverage of the White House’s politically-motivated firings of U.S. Attorneys. Its reporting precipitated congressional hearings and the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Talking Points Memo was the first exclusively digital news organization to win the award. After the site won the Polk Award, the New York Times published a profile of Marshall (“Blogger, Sans Pajamas, Rakes Muck and a Prize”).</p>\n<p>The site attributes information to credible sources including court documents, first-hand interviews, and reputable news organizations such as HuffPost, the Washington Post, and Bloomberg. It publishes editor’s notes at the top of stories in the event of an error or correction.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site’s masthead lists all staff members. Writers’ names link to profiles, most of which include contact information in the form of Twitter handles or email addresses. Opinion pieces not written by staff members include author profiles.</p>\n<p>Visitors may send news tips or feedback to an email address provided on the site’s homepage.</p>\n<p>The site clearly labels all advertising. Its copyright statement discloses its relationship with TPM Media.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Josh Marshall, who was the Washington editor of the liberal magazine American Prospect, founded Talking Points Memo as a personal blog in November 2000. It was in reaction to the 2000 presidential election recount in Florida. In a September 2008 keynote speech at Ithaca College, Marshall described the trajectory of the site’s development, stating that “[a]fter the 2004 election, it had become second nature to me to make use of the readership as a source of information. What I did on the site was a hybrid of traditional journalism and what we now call collaborative journalism - working with readers.” In 2005, Marshall raised over $100,000 from readers, which he used to hire two reporters and begin to turn Talking Points Memo into a full-service news site. As of April 2018, the site employs 25 staff members.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nNina Zweig\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Jim
