{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<div class=\"right-score\">Score: 0</div>\n<h1>youtube.com&emsp; <span class=\"net-country\">(WEB - en-US)</span></h1>\n<p>A video-sharing website owned by Google. YouTube allows anyone to post content and features few mechanisms for controlling what is posted.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<p>YouTube is a subsidiary of Google, which is owned by Alphabet, Inc. Alphabet is a publicly traded company set up to organize Google’s business structure.</p>\n<p>Alphabet does not separately disclose YouTube’s revenue. YouTube runs advertisements, and also offers paid services including YouTube Premium (which provides exclusive content and ad-free access to the website) and YouTube TV (a streaming subscription service that in the U.S. streams live content from major American networks.)</p>\n<p>Uploads on YouTube can be monetized through the YouTube Partner Program. YouTube typically takes a share of a partner’s advertising revenue. Copyright holders whose content is posted to YouTube without permission can either ask to have it taken down, or can leave it up and collect a portion of the advertising revenue.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Any YouTube user with an account can upload as much video content as they like, relating to whatever subject they wish. Videos on the site range from digitized amateur wedding tapes to professionally produced made-for-YouTube original drama series. The website, which in July 2018 was the second most-trafficked in the world after Google.com, according to the Alexa Traffic Rank, regularly gives rise to internationally popular videos and trends. Some of the most shared videos (dubbed “viral” videos) have become well-known cultural phenomena, including 2013’s “Harlem Shake,” 2012’s “Gangnam Style,” the 2010 series of “Downfall” parodies, and 2007’s “Charlie Bit My Finger.” YouTube has also been at least partially responsible for launching the careers of entertainers, including Justin Bieber and Susan Boyle. Most of the website’s 100 top-viewed videos are music videos.</p>\n<p>YouTube hosts a wide range of “communities,” made up of individual video creators, celebrities, news organizations, companies, and consumers. Popular genres include video game reviews, makeup tutorials, comedy, health and fitness, and education.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>YouTube is a platform, not a curated news and information outlet. While many prominent news organizations such as CNN, Fox News, and Vice regularly post videos on YouTube, content on the website can be created by anyone and is not fact-checked by YouTube. Thus, one of the most popular YouTube news channels is RT, the Russian government-owned propaganda channel. Any video on the site, political or otherwise, can cherry-pick facts, figures, and stories, make sensational claims, or outright fabricate information without oversight from YouTube.</p>\n<p>YouTube notes in its community guidelines that it does not tolerate “misleading metadata.” This means that Youtube can take down a video that uses a misleading thumbnail image, headline, title, or tags. YouTube notes that “This is especially important to remember in relation to current events or viral videos…. Videos that are deemed deceptive will be removed from the site and strikes may be issued to the uploader.”</p>\n<p>“Strikes” are issued against YouTube users violating the website’s community guidelines and last for three months each. Having more strikes against an account gives rise to greater levels of account restrictions. An account that receives three strikes over a three month period will be terminated. Other community guidelines include warnings against “impersonation,” “hateful content,” and “harassment and cyberbullying.”</p>\n<p>While YouTube’s community guidelines do not specifically require creators to post truthful content, the site has taken some action against accounts that spread particularly harmful false information. In February 2018, InfoWars’ YouTube account received a strike for harassment after posting a video claiming Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg was a paid actor. In July 2018 the account received another strike for four videos that YouTube said violated its rules prohibiting hate speech and child endangerment.</p>\n<p>In March 2017 YouTube was criticized after advertisements from well-known brands appeared next to videos containing extremist views and hate speech. In response the site announced it was both increasing the number of organizations involved in its “Trusted Flagger” program and using machine-learning techniques to help identify more videos that are not appropriate for advertiser content. In January 2018 YouTube changed the rules for its YouTube Partner Program to make it harder for smaller accounts to receive advertising revenue, aiming to demonetize small, extremist accounts as well as spammers and impersonators.</p>\n<p>YouTube uses algorithms to curate user-specific content recommendations. Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018, YouTube Chief Product Officer Neal Mohan said that more than 70 percent of the time users spend watching YouTube is guided by the site’s algorithm-driven recommendations. This content-tailoring has a tendency to expose viewers to more extreme viewpoints and has provoked criticism that YouTube is encouraging and profiting from radicalization.</p>\n<p>Writing in the New York Times’ Opinion section in March 2018, for example, Zeynep Tufekci, a University of North Carolina sociologist, argued that YouTube “leads viewers down a rabbit hole of extremism, while Google racks up the ad sales.” Tufekci described how watching videos of Donald Trump’s rallies eventually led YouTube to recommend to her Holocaust denial videos, and that watching videos of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders eventually led to suggested content about the U.S. government perpetrating the 9/11 attacks.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>YouTube does not require its content creators to reveal their identity. Some users with millions of subscribers disclose little information about themselves. For example, the accounts “HowToBasic” (over 11.5 million global subscribers), “H2ODelirious” (11 million subscribers), and “I Hate Everything” (1.8 million global subscribers), do not include identifying information about their creators. However, many of the most prominent YouTube creators feature their faces in their videos, are easily searchable online, and attend in-person publicity events. Examples of such YouTubers are Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg (PewDiePie, 64.5 million global subscribers), Germán Garmendia (HolaSoyGerman, 34 million subscribers), and Rubén Doblas Gundersen (ElRubiusOMG, 30 million subscribers.)</p>\n<p>YouTube’s secret algorithm for determining “advertiser-friendly content” (meaning content that can carry advertisements and thus be monetizable) has come under scrutiny for allegedly penalizing video creators without obvious cause. The site has been criticized by LGBTQ+ content creators, for example, for allegedly removing advertisements and implementing age restrictions on videos that feature words including “transgender,” “lesbian,” and “asexual” in the title. In response, YouTube apologized and noted: “Our system sometimes make[s] mistakes in understanding context and nuances when it assesses which videos to make available in Restricted Mode.”</p>\n<p>In September 2016, YouTube contributors including the “Vlogbrothers” and Philip DeFranco complained that YouTube had removed advertisements from a slew of videos with titles ranging from “Leaked Video of SJW LOSING IT Blows Up In Her Face” to “Vegetables that look like penises.” DeFranco charged that this was “censorship with a different name.” YouTube responded that it had not changed its policies regarding advertiser-friendly content, and that the removal notices regarding advertisements on these videos was the result of new tools the site had introduced to help creators keep track of their videos’ monetization. YouTube also noted that it had introduced an appeals process for creators who feel the advertising was wrongly removed from their videos.</p>\n<p>In a December 2017 blog post, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki announced that YouTube would begin creating “a regular report where we will provide more aggregate data about the flags we receive and the actions we take to remove videos and comments that violate our content policies.” These reports are now available at transparencyreport.google.com.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>YouTube was founded in 2005 by Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, all of whom were PayPal employees. Google purchased the company in 2006. YouTube launched its paid subscription service, YouTube Red, in October 2015; it was rebranded YouTube Premium in May 2018. In April 2018 a shooting occurred at YouTube’s headquarters in California, resulting in three injuries and the self-inflicted death of the assailant. The attacker was allegedly motivated by the belief that YouTube was censoring her and preventing her from earning revenue from her videos.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBron Maher\n\nEdited
