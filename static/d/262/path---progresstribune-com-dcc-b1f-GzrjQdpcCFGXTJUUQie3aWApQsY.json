It appears to be funded with programmatic advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Progress Tribune publishes opinionated stories based on reporting done by other news outlets or on social media posts. Content is primarily critical of President Donald Trump, his administration and the Republican Party. Headlines in September 2018 included, “The Shame: Trump Just Realized His Woeful Inadequacy in Brokering Middle East Peace,” and “Mueller Is Raking It In, Trump Likely to Meltdown in 3..2..1..”</p>\n<p>Almost all content is labeled News Commentary, and published on both the home page and in a section of the same name. There are two other sections, Polls and Video. In September 2018, the Polls section included two user polls, one titled “POLL: How Sad Are You To See Obama Leave The White House?”  In an About Us section the site describes itself as a “100% independent news-aggregation website.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Progress Tribune often publishes misleading and factually erroneous content to advance liberal narratives.</p>\n<p>A September 2018 story titled “Joe Walsh Trashes Trump Jr. As An ‘Idiot’” was based on tweets by Walsh, a former Republican Illinois congressman. In the Progresstribune.com article, an anonymous author wrote that then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “raped a woman back in the early 1980s,” which is false. Kavanaugh had been accused of sexual assault, not rape, and he was not charged or convicted. The same story said Kavanaugh “apparently hates women in even more ways than we thought possible” and that Donald Trump Jr. wrote an Instagram caption, “outing himself as a sociopath and misogynist.” Evidence was not provided for either assertion.</p>\n<p>Another article published the same day was titled, “Trump Thought the Kavanaugh Scandal Was Bad. Ivanka Just Made It Worse.” The story’s author called Kavanaugh a “rapist” who faced a “serious risk of ending up in prison.” The piece began by saying Ivanka Trump “has a delusion that if she says the right things in public every once in a while, then mainstream America will come to respect her. …But she just made everything even worse for her evil father.”</p>\n<p>A September 2018 story, with the headline “Here Are the 10 Senate Seats That Will Turn Democrat,” featured a list of “the top 10 seats most likely to flip” to Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections. However, six of the 10 were already occupied by Democrats.</p>\n<p>Authors insert opinions into stories, such as in “Trump Just Got A Dose Of Truth Medicine After His Outrageous Claim About Americans.” It began, “In his newest Fox News interview, President Trump boasted, in reference to the American people, ‘Our people have more pride then they used to have (sic).’ This is a lie the president has been pushing for a while now.” The article ends with, “President Donald Trump is a liar, and he sucks.” </p>\n<p>A September 2018 piece, “Mike Pence Just Made a Huge Blunder,” included unsubstantiated claims Vice President Mike Pence wrote an anonymous New York Times op-ed that said senior members of Trump’s administration are attempting to undermine him. “Starbucks Driving Conservatives Crazy,” a story about Starbucks ending the use of plastic straws, did not provide information about the ideology of those opposing the policy. In addition, a photo showed people protesting outside a Starbucks, but with no caption or attribution. The photo, NewsGuard learned, involved a protest unrelated to plastic straws.</p>\n<p>The site does not list a corrections policy, and NewsGuard could not find examples of articles being updated or corrected.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The About Us section states that “views expressed herein are the views of the linked author exclusively and not necessarily the views of Progress Tribune or its advertisers.” The site description does not mention ProgressTribune.com’s liberal perspective. Progress Tribune does not provide information about ownership, writers or content creators, or management. Articles do not show when they were published. The site has a Contact Us form, but a site error prevented NewsGuard from sending a message seeking comment about ownership and editorial practices. Three Facebook messages sent to Progress Tribune and administrators of a group associated with its Facebook page were not answered. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site was created in December 2016. Coverage has consistently focused on the Trump presidency, according to web archives.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nMacaela Bennett\n\nEdited by:\nJosh Keefe&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://progresstribune.com/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">http://progresstribune.com/about-us/ </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://progresstribune.com/12323/mmg1-something-doesnt-add-up-about-supreme-court-justice-anthony-kennedys-resignation/\" target=\"_blank\">http://progresstribune.com/12323/mmg1-something-doesnt-add-up-about-supreme-court-justice-anthony-kennedys-resignation/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://progresstribune.com/5931/pt1-fsm2-trump-forces-reportedly-planning-smear-reporters-trump-jr-story/\" target=\"_blank\">http://progresstribune.com/5931/pt1-fsm2-trump-forces-reportedly-planning-smear-reporters-trump-jr-story/ </a></li>\n<li>Trump Just Endured The Most Epic Mocking Twitter Has Ever Produced <a href=\"http://archive.today/qdQ0k\" target=\"_blank\">http://archive.today/qdQ0k </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180920211810/http://progresstribune.com/14053/shame-trump-just-realized-woeful-inadequacy-brokering-middle-east-peace/\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.archive.org/web/20180920211810/http://progresstribune.com/14053/shame-trump-just-realized-woeful-inadequacy-brokering-middle-east-peace/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://progresstribune.com/14297/report-possible-criminal-charges-trumps-fema-director/\" target=\"_blank\">http://progresstribune.com/14297/report-possible-criminal-charges-trumps-fema-director/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://progresstribune.com/3662/poll-will-really-benefit-trump-tax-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\">http://progresstribune.com/3662/poll-will-really-benefit-trump-tax-cuts/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://progresstribune.com/74/poll-sad-see-obama-leave-white-house/\" target=\"_blank\">http://progresstribune.com/74/poll-sad-see-obama-leave-white-house/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://progresstribune.com/1891/trumps-reckless-order-kills-navy-seal-now-dad-demanding-investigation/\" target=\"_blank\">http://progresstribune.com/1891/trumps-reckless-order-kills-navy-seal-now-dad-demanding-investigation/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://progresstribune.com/14311/hannity-now-influence-trump-security-officials/\" target=\"_blank\">http://progresstribune.com/14311/hannity-now-influence-trump-security-officials/ </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://progresstribune.com/14015/mmg1-big-problems-fallout-trumps-economic-illiteracy/\" target=\"_blank\">http://progresstribune.com/14015/mmg1-big-problems-fallout-trumps-economic-illiteracy/ </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li>Trump Thought the Kavanaugh Scandal Was Bad.
