The site relies on more than 1,000 volunteers to do its work, but the founder and public face of WikiLeaks is Julian Assange, an Australian hacker and activist. The site says that Assange is WikiLeaks’ founder and publisher. </p>\n<p>Assange has been living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden in connection with an investigation into allegations of rape, sexual molestation and unlawful coercion. Assange has denied the accusations. The investigation was eventually dropped due to Assange's refusal to cooperate, but he is still wanted by U.K. authorities for skipping bail in connection with the investigation.</p>\n<p>The site is owned by Sunshine Press Productions, a company registered in Iceland in 2010 that lists Assange as its chairman. Its shareholders or financers are not clearly disclosed.</p>\n<p>The site’s About page says “WikiLeaks is entirely funded by its publisher, its publication sales and the general public.”</p>\n<p>A Donate page on the site directs users to make contributions via credit card and PayPal through the Wau Holland Foundation, a German nonprofit named after an influential computer hacker. However, WikiLeaks does not disclose its donors. </p>\n<p>WikiLeaks also accepts donations through a variety of cryptocurrencies, a system it turned to after Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal stopped processing donations to the organization after WikiLeaks began publishing U.S. government diplomatic cables in 2010. WikiLeaks dubbed the efforts a “blockade,” that a spokesperson said was “the privatization of censorship, because this is being done because of extreme pressure by the U.S. government.” </p>\n<p>Assange began hosting a program on the Kremlin-backed RT television channel in 2012. Neither the site nor Assange has revealed how much he was paid for the show. </p>\n<p>WikiLeaks also earns revenue by selling branded merchandise. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>WikiLeaks publishes large troves of secret government and corporate documents, which it obtains through a secure site that is only accessible using Tor, software that allows users to avoid cyber surveillance. Visitors to the site can search for specific phrases across millions of documents. </p>\n<p>WikiLeaks’ homepage lists the site’s most recently published document troves. As of January 2019, those included a searchable archive of 30,000 emails and attachments sent and received from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private email server; “Spy Files: Russia,” containing documents from Russian telecommunications company Peter-Service related to domestic surveillance in Russia; and several installments of the “Vault 7” leaks, which disclosed hacking tools used by the CIA that enable the agency to hack Skype, commercial antivirus programs, and Wi-Fi networks.  </p>\n<p>The site houses a cache of documents provided by Chelsea Manning, a U.S. Army private who gave the site roughly 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables and nearly 500,000 U.S. Army reports on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which included new details about civilian deaths and Iranian involvement in the Iraq. WikiLeaks published the material in 2010. During the 2016 presidential race, it published thousands of emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. </p>\n<p>WikiLeaks has also published confidential United Nations reports, documents from the Church of Scientology, embarassing emails hacked from Sony (which led to the resignation of Sony Pictures co-chair), cables from the Saudi Foreign Ministry, and emails from private intelligence firm HBGary, among other document collections. </p>\n<p>The site also features “ICE Patrol,” described on the site as a “searchable archive of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) employees with LinkedIn profiles.” Unlike other WikiLeaks projects, ICE Patrol, published in June 2018, contains publicly available information culled from the LinkedIn profiles of ICE employees. Despite the public nature of the information, an ICE spokesperson called the publication “unconscionable,” and said it “potentially puts at risk those who have taken an oath to uphold the law and protect public safety.” WikiLeaks said the data release was appropriate for “increasing accountability, especially in light of the extreme actions taken by ICE lately, such as the separation of children and parents at the US border.”</p>\n<p>The site has several categories it uses to organize documents, including Intelligence, Global Economy, International Politics, Corporations, Government, and War &#x26; Military. It also has a News section, which contains news about WikiLeaks, Assange’s legal troubles, and notices of monetary rewards for leaking specific documents the organization is seeking. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>WikiLeaks has published documents that have altered public discourse around national security and privacy, and has jolted international relations and U.S. politics. One of its most famous releases was a video the site dubbed “Collateral Murder,” which showed a 2007 U.S. military assault in Iraq that killed 12 people, including two Reuters staff members. The site also published hacked emails from the DNC during the 2016 election that seemed to show the committee favoring Clinton over Senator Bernie Sanders. The revelation led to the resignation of DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz just as the Democratic National Convention was getting underway. </p>\n<p>Amnesty International and others have credited WikiLeaks’ publication of U.S. diplomatic cables with helping to spark protests in Tunisia that led to the ouster of longtime president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011.</p>\n<p>WikiLeaks, often criticized for releasing information without regard to its impact, stresses that it always works to verify the authenticity of the documents it publishes. For example, the group uses an email verification system called DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) that it says allows it to independently authenticate the content of emails.</p>\n<p>In 2016, WikiLeaks published hacked emails showing that Donna Brazile, then the DNC vice chair and a CNN commentator, had passed potential topics that Clinton would be asked about at a CNN town hall event to the Clinton campaign. Brazile denied providing the material to the Clinton camp, and implied that the emails had been altered. In response, WikiLeaks pointed to the authenticated DKIM signatures as evidence the emails were, according to WikiLeaks, “essentially indisputable.” Brazile later acknowledged sending the topics to the Clinton campaign.</p>\n<p>WikiLeaks also has worked with traditional news organizations. For example, when Manning leaked hundreds of thousands of documents to WikiLeaks, the leaked diplomatic cables were shared with The New York Times, France’s Le Monde, Spain’s El Pais, Der Spiegel, and Britain's The Guardian. The news organizations were given early access to the trove and helped verify the authenticity of many of the documents and recommended which documents WikiLeaks should redact or withhold.</p>\n<p>Although cybersecurity experts have warned that Russian hackers, among others, sometimes alter documents they leak, as of August 2018, NewsGuard could not find any confirmed cases of faked or doctored material published in WikiLeaks document dumps.</p>\n<p>While the site’s staff does redact some information from published documents, it has often published personal and sensitive security information, drawing widespread criticism that the leaks endangered safety and privacy without advancing a compelling public interest.</p>\n<p>In 2010, the Times of London said that in two hours of searching WikiLeaks’ archive of Afghan war documents, it was able to find the names of dozens of Afghans who had served as informants to NATO forces — an identification that could have endangered their safety in Afghanistan. Just a few days earlier, Assange had said the database had been checked for named informants.</p>\n<p>The site also published Social Security and credit card numbers of DNC donors when it published the party’s hacked emails in 2016.</p>\n<p>A 2016 Associated Press report found that WikiLeaks had published “the personal information of hundreds of people -- including sick children, rape victims and mental health patients.” The report found that the site disclosed the name of a Saudi citizen arrested for “sexual deviation,” a term used by the Saudi government to describe homosexuality, which the AP said “can lead to social ostracism, a prison sentence or even death in the ultra conservative Muslim kingdom.”</p>\n<p>In 2016, WikiLeaks published a database of emails from Turkey’s ruling AKP party that it called the #ErdoganEmails on Twitter, named for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In response, Turkish author and professor Zeynep Tufekci noted in a Huffington Post article that none of the emails appeared to be from Erdogan or his inner circle and said she was not aware of “anything ‘newsworthy’ being uncovered.” However, Tufekci wrote, WikiLeaks tweeted links to databases that contained personal information of “what appears to be every female voter in 79 out of 81 provinces in Turkey” to promote the emails, which were published shortly after an attempted coup against Erdogan failed.</p>\n<p>Assange has defended this practice as “scientific journalism,” which is how he described the act of publishing all journalistic source material, in a New Yorker interview in 2010. In another interview with The New Yorker published in 2017, Assange said, “We come not to save journalism but to destroy it. Doesn’t deserve to live. Too debased...The basic asymmetric information between writer and reader just encourages lying.”</p>\n<p>Edward Snowden, the former CIA contractor who leaked classified evidence of U.S. government surveillance programs, chose not to leak the material to WikiLeaks, citing the organization’s lack of curation. In July 2016, Snowden tweeted “Democratizing information has never been more vital, and<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/wikileaks&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1548451209579000\" style=\"color:inherit;text-decoration:inherit\"> @Wikileaks</a> has helped. But their hostility to even modest curation is a mistake.”  </p>\n<p>The two 2016 dumps of documents hurtful to Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, and the Democratic party were widely seen as deliberate attempts to influence the election. WikiLeaks’ first publication of DNC emails came on July 22, 2016, the day that Clinton announced her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. Then, it published a batch of Podesta’s emails on October 7, less than an hour after The Washington Post broke news of a tape showing Donald Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women. WikiLeaks has said that it “schedules publications to maximize readership and reader engagement.”</p>\n<p>WikiLeaks has never disclosed the source of the emails — and Assange has publicly denied that the information came from Russia. However, the U.S. intelligence community has maintained they were stolen by Kremlin-backed hackers. In July 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged 12 Russian officers with stealing the emails from the DNC and the Clinton Campaign. </p>\n<p>Although WikiLeaks has not identified a political ideology on its site, Assange has not hidden his dislike of Clinton. In February 2016, Assange wrote a rare opinion column on the site, titled “A vote today for Hillary Clinton is a vote for endless, stupid war.” He called Clinton a “war hawk with bad judgement who gets an unseemly emotional rush out of killing people. She shouldn't be let near a gun shop, let alone an army. And she certainly should not become president of the United States.”</p>\n<p>In August 2016, Assange hinted on Dutch television that the source for the Democratic emails was DNC staffer Seth Rich, who was murdered in July 2016 in what police say was a botched robbery. Law enforcement officials have repeatedly debunked a widely circulated theory that Rich was killed for leaking the documents, and no evidence has emerged showing that he communicated with WikiLeaks.</p>\n<p>Leaked Twitter messages obtained by The Atlantic show that the WikiLeaks’ Twitter account, which is widely believed to be run by Assange, had communicated with Donald Trump Jr. during the 2016 campaign and its aftermath. In one instance, the WikiLeaks account asked Trump Jr. to push a story published by True Pundit — known for publishing false information and conspiracy theories — which cited anonymous State Department sources who said that in 2010 Clinton asked why the U.S. just couldn’t “drone” Assange during a meeting. WikiLeaks also asked Trump Jr. to provide the group with his father’s tax returns, explaining that it would “dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality,” according to the leaked messages.</p>\n<p>In August 2018, ABC News reported that Mueller’s team questioned at least five witnesses about contacts with WikiLeaks as part of Mueller’s investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>In late January 2019, Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump who worked briefly as a formal adviser to the Trump campaign, was charged by Mueller’s office with one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements, and one count of witness tampering, all related to his alleged communications with WikiLeaks concerning document releases that would be damaging to the Clinton campaign.</p>\n<p>After appearing in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Stone was released on a $250,000 bond. He said outside the courthouse that he would fight the charges, calling the Mueller probe “politically motivated.”  </p>\n<p>Barry Pollack, Assange’s U.S. attorney, told The Washington Post, “The charges against Mr. Stone do not allege that Mr. Stone lied about his contacts with Julian Assange, but rather about his contacts with others and about documents reflecting those communications. The Office of Special Counsel has never spoken with Mr. Assange.”</p>\n<p>Assange has stated publicly that he does not have a problem with WikiLeaks effectively becoming a tool that nations use as part of their information warfare. In a 2017 interview with Der Spiegel, Assange was asked if the site’s policy was to “publish authentic documents as quickly as possible, regardless of who benefits or is damaged?” Assange replied, “That’s our current policy.”</p>\n<p>WikiLeaks’ publications during the 2016 election prompted then-candidate Trump to declare “I love WikiLeaks.” Senior members of his administration, however, do not share that feeling.  In 2017, then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo, now the Secretary of State, said “WikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service,” and declared the site a threat to national security.</p>\n<p>Because of its repeated failure to curate or redact sensitive information in its documents and because of federal authorities’ conclusion that the 2016 election-related dumps came from the Russian government in a bid to disrupt U.S. elections, NewsGuard has determined that WikiLeaks does not gather and present information responsibly. </p>\n<p>Due to its strategic publication of damaging information against the Democrats during the U.S. presidential election cycle, without disclosing a political ideology or agenda, NewsGuard has assessed that it does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. </p>\n<p>WikiLeaks does not appear to run corrections, although it almost exclusively publishes primary source documents, which have never been shown to be fake. </p>\n<p>WikiLeaks did not respond to three emails sent to a press email address seeking comment about NewsGuard’s determinations and the site’s editorial practices. Wau Holland, the foundation that processes donations for WikiLeaks, did not respond to a message sent through the site’s contact form.  </p>\n<p>Assange’s U.S. attorney, Barry Pollack, told NewsGuard he could not provide information about WikiLeaks or its editorial policies because the organization is not his client.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>In addition to Assange, the site lists three “WikiLeaks Advocates” -- journalists who appear to be affiliated with WikiLeaks, although the exact nature of the relationship is unclear. The site says it depends on volunteers who assist with design, translations, IT, research, and legal representation, according to the site. The site does not disclose the identities of volunteers.  </p>\n<p>Wikileaks did not respond to three emails with questions about “Wikileaks Advocates” and the identities of site staff and volunteers.</p>\n<p>WikiLeaks provides a secure way to contact the site about document submissions using Tor software. It also provides an email address for press inquiries. It has a section on its website titled “People for Comment,” which lists people who “do not necessarily represent WikiLeaks” but can comment on relevant subjects. For example, Assange’s U.S. criminal attorney is listed with his telephone number.   </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>WikiLeaks was launched by Assange in 2006. In 2010, WikiLeaks spokesman Daniel Domscheit-Berg left the organization due to a falling out with Assange. “Julian Assange reacted to any criticism with the allegation that I was disobedient to him and disloyal to the project,” Domscheit-Berg told Der Spiegel.</p>\n<p>In 2010, Swedish authorities issued an international arrest warrant for Assange for suspicion of rape, sexual molestation and unlawful coercion stemming from sexual encounters with two Swedish women. After losing a legal battle to avoid extradition to Sweden while in the U.K., Assange eventually fled to London’s Ecuadorian Embassy in 2012. Swedish authorities discontinued the investigation in 2017 because, they said, “all prospects of pursuing the investigation are now exhausted.”</p>\n<p>However, Assange is still subject to the possibility of arrest by U.K. authorities if he leaves the embassy, for violating his bail by fleeing to the Ecuadorian Embassy to avoid extradition. Assange’s team also fears the U.S. will charge him with crimes related to his publication of classified documents if he is taken into custody in the U.K.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government has been investigating Assange since at least 2010 due to his involvement in publishing classified material. In 2017, then U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said arresting Assange was “a priority.”</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJosh Keefe\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric
