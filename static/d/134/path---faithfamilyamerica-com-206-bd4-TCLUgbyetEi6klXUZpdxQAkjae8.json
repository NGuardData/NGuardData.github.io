The company operates three other websites. Its advertising agency provides social media and viral internet campaigns for conservative groups. Its clients have included Glenn Beck’s Mercury One, the Museum of the Bible, and political action committees that support President Donald Trump and former U.S. Senate Candidate Roy Moore.</p>\n<p>The CEO of Strategic Media 21 is Mark Weimer, who also leads Alleluu, a nonprofit “dedicated to reaching America and the world for Jesus Christ using social and online media,” according to the organization’s website.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>A quote from Ronald Reagan that runs at the bottom of the website frames Faith Family America’s coverage: “If we ever forget that we are one nation under God, then we will be a nation gone under.”</p>\n<p>FaithFamilyAmerica.com’s About Us page emphasizes its commitment to delivering positive news coverage, primarily contained in the “uplifting” and “family” sections of the website, which cover topics like wedding proposals, pregnancy, celebrity outfits, and the British royal family.</p>\n<p>However, although the site’s About says “we love posting positive stories,” many of stories on the homepage are about misfortunes such as murders, product recalls, medical complications, and other tragedies mixed in with fawning coverage of the first family, particularly of first lady Melania Trump’s fashion choices.</p>\n<p>Stories aimed at readers with a Christian, conservative viewpoint appear under “Politics,” “Faith,” and “America” sections. Flattering coverage of Trump and his policies appears alongside stories about conservative and Christian celebrities, like Meghan McCain, Candace Cameron Bure, and evangelist Franklin Graham.</p>\n<p>Some stories are published from The Daily Caller News Foundation, a nonprofit associated with another conservative digital news outlet. The site includes stories on notable deaths, crimes, or disasters that were originally reported elsewhere.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Faith Family America writers insert their own commentary into stories based on other news outlets’ reports or social media posts. Writers generally provide links to sources, such as videos, tweets, or Facebook or Instagram posts.</p>\n<p>Weimer, of Strategic Media 21, told NewsGuard that writers at the company, “try to make sure that information is confirmed by what we would call mainstream media sources,” such as ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox News, or The New York Times.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Faith Family America publishes some stories from unverified sources, without attempting to reach the other side, a practice that has led NewsGuard to determine it does not gather and present information responsibly.</p>\n<p>For example, a story published on the site in July 2018 headlined “Media Ignores Amazing Story After President Trump Donates Latest Salary to Incredible Cause,” quotes a tweet by Mark Simone, a conservative radio personality who said that, “Instead of taking his salary, Trump donated all $400,000 to the Department of the Interior where it will be used for construction and repair needs at military cemeteries! 'Media gave this no coverage.’”</p>\n<p>This claim has been cited by many fact-checking organizations as false. President Trump has been donating his salary, after taxes, to a different department every quarter. One of Trump’s four donations in 2017 was to the National Parks Service, which is part of the Department of the Interior, but the funds were used to repair fencing and a house on the Antietam battlefield, not military cemeteries. Faith Family America’s story relied only on the tweet, with no other support for the claim and no attempt to reach the government or Trump for confirmation.</p>\n<p>Faith Family America does not disclose that it approaches the news with a conservative perspective, but writers frequently express sympathy or support in articles for those political figures or celebrities who express conservative, Christian positions. Some of those politicians and other public figures belong to organizations that have worked with the advertising agency of Faith Family America’s owner, Strategic Media 21. However, Weimer told NewsGuard that Strategic Media 21’s clients and work done by its agency do not influence the content created by the companies’ websites.</p>\n<p>On several occasions, writers for Faith Family America have published stories that are disparaging to LGBTQ communities and featured coverage of public figures who express similar views. Writers have also criticized policies recognizing transgender people, such as an Indiana school district policy that requires teachers to refer to transgender students by their preferred gender pronouns. A story referred to the policy as “one of the greatest attacks on our children today.”</p>\n<p>Other stories have expressed opposition to same-sex marriage. Many stories reference social media posts by Franklin Graham, an evangelist pastor who has made public statements denouncing LGBTQ rights.</p>\n<p>When asked whether the site’s content could be described as conservative, Weimer told NewsGuard, “From our standpoint, we feel we are unbiased, and that’s our goal.”</p>\n<p>In response to NewsGuard questions on whether it has a corrections policy, Strategic Media 21 instituted a corrections policy by August 2018, but a subsqeuqnt review by NewsGuard of the site did not find any corrections. Weimer confirmed that no stories have been corrected on the site.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Faith Family America discloses on its site that it is owned by Strategic Media 21, without explaining the company’s political work and clients. It does not disclose the names of editors in charge, and although stories have bylines with writers’ names, no further information about them is available.</p>\n<p>Weimer said that the website would add information about its ownership, but said writers are purposely not listed with contact information to protect them from harassment online.</p>\n<p>The Contact page of Faith Family America provides readers a general email address they can use to give feedback or suggestions to content creators.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The FaithFamilyAmerica.com domain was registered in 2013.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this label incorrectly reported Mark Weimer's title at Strategic Media 21; his correct title is CEO.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written
