Revenue primarily comes from advertising. The Disruptor Capital investment firm, headed by media executive and Republican activist Pete Snyder, provided $1.5 million in funding in 2015.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>IJR users see a chronological feed of breaking political, cultural, and trending news. Reporters produce original stories on the Trump administration, gun rights, immigration, and national security.</p>\n<p>Users can filter the feed by topics -- “Red,” “Blue,” “News” or “All” -- and sort results by timestamp or engagement. IJR allows users to filter by “Blue” and “Red” articles in an attempt to appeal to both liberal and conservative audiences, although most of the site’s articles have a conservative viewpoint.</p>\n<p>IJR.com became known for widely shared videos during the 2016 presidential campaign, such as a clip showing Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham destroying his cell phone after then-candidate Donald Trump publicly shared Graham’s cell phone number.</p>\n<p>In statements on the site describing its mission, IJR writes, “people don’t know who to trust online for news. We’re organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides, so you can be fully informed on the news impacting your life.”</p>\n<p>IJR did not respond to two emails from NewsGuard requesting further explanation of the criteria used to sort articles into different feeds.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>IJR.com’s newsroom includes recruits from The Washington Post, Politico, and BuzzFeed. Its news stories generally attribute information to named sources, often linking to video or embedding social media posts. It runs corrections with editor’s notes at the bottom of the relevant article.</p>\n<p>The site publishes lengthy editorial standards on its About page, pledging to provide original and fact-based reporting, and disclosing policies on the use of quotations, conflicts of interest, and how journalists should identify themselves. It is a participant in the Trust Project, a consortium of news organizations developing and promoting transparency standards for the news media.</p>\n<p>The site has demoted or dismissed high-profile staffers over various standards issues. In March 2017, then chief content director Benny Johnson, who had been accused earlier of plagiarism, was demoted for violating company standards, and fired seven months later. Johnson did not respond to two emails from NewsGuard requesting comment on his time working at IJR.</p>\n<p>At approximately the same time, IJR suspended two other staffers over the publication of a post suggesting that a visit by former President Barack Obama to his home state of Hawaii was connected to a Hawaii judge’s ruling against President Trump’s proposed travel ban. The site’s congressional reporter, Joe Perticone, had resigned in protest of the post, which was removed from the site.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site’s About page indicates its ownership by MGA and details the site’s editorial standards, developed in collaboration with the Trust Project (thetrustproject.org) a consortium of news organizations working to improve public trust in media.</p>\n<p>Articles link to short author pages, which include email addresses and sometimes social media links and short biographies. The site does not publish a comprehensive staff list or disclose its top editors. It did not respond to a NewsGuard email requesting comment about the absence of information about site leaders.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site was founded in 2012 by Alex Skatell, who was media director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and Philip Musser, who served as an advisor to 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Musser sold his stake in Media Group of America in 2017 and left the company to become chief communications officer at Boeing.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nGrace Niewijk\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ijr.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">https://ijr.com/about</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=244177860\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=244177860</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/ijreview-gets-1m-funding-led-by-gop-politico-and-investor-pete-snyder/2015/01/06/cb5213cc-95d6-11e4-8005-1924ede3e54a_story.html?utm_term=.23f487673a54\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/ijreview-gets-1m-funding-led-by-gop-politico-and-investor-pete-snyder/2015/01/06/cb5213cc-95d6-11e4-8005-1924ede3e54a<em>story.html?utm</em>term=.23f487673a54</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/benny-johnson-got-fired-at-buzzfeed-you-will-believe-what-happened-next/2015/06/09/da9fe3f8-e37f-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html?utm_term=.0d7d3d4102eb\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/benny-johnson-got-fired-at-buzzfeed-you-will-believe-what-happened-next/2015/06/09/da9fe3f8-e37f-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310<em>story.html?utm</em>term=.0d7d3d4102eb</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-supreme-court-gorsuch-scoop-234518\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-supreme-court-gorsuch-scoop-234518</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/business/media/independent-journal-review-website-becomes-a-draw-for-conservatives.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/business/media/independent-journal-review-website-becomes-a-draw-for-conservatives.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/katherinemiller/the-right-wing-has-its-own-upworthy-and-you-wont-believe-how?utm_term=.vp82q4RWr#.er72YkAK0\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/katherinemiller/the-right-wing-has-its-own-upworthy-and-you-wont-believe-how?utm_term=.vp82q4RWr#.er72YkAK0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/benny-johnson-independent-journal-review-2017-3\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.businessinsider.com/benny-johnson-independent-journal-review-2017-3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.realprogressivesusa.com/news/community/2018-03-30-why-you-should-stop-sharing-content-from-ijr-blue\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.realprogressivesusa.com/news/community/2018-03-30-why-you-should-stop-sharing-content-from-ijr-blue</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Press_Release/abc-news-hosts-hampshire-republicans-debate-partnership-wmur/story?id=36721534\" target=\"_blank\">https://abcnews.go.com/Press_Release/abc-news-hosts-hampshire-republicans-debate-partnership-wmur/story?id=36721534</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/independent-journal-review-ijr-identity-trump-2017-3\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.businessinsider.com/independent-journal-review-ijr-identity-trump-2017-3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/irj-conspiracy-theory-obama-hawaii-court-2017-3\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.businessinsider.com/irj-conspiracy-theory-obama-hawaii-court-2017-3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ijr.com/trump-calls-for-an-end-uss-laughingstock-immigration-system-that-prioritizes-diversity/\" target=\"_blank\">https://ijr.com/trump-calls-for-an-end-uss-laughingstock-immigration-system-that-prioritizes-diversity/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ijr.com/david-perdue-student-phone/\" target=\"_blank\">https://ijr.com/david-perdue-student-phone/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ijr.com/category/ijr-red/\" target=\"_blank\">https://ijr.com/category/ijr-red/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ijr.com/category/ijr-blue/\" target=\"_blank\">https://ijr.com/category/ijr-blue/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/phil-musser-takes-top-boeing-job-new-partners-to-lead-imge-1513388242-4907dcde-3a9c-426f-9fc2-b475fdcc1550.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.axios.com/phil-musser-takes-top-boeing-job-new-partners-to-lead-imge-1513388242-4907dcde-3a9c-426f-9fc2-b475fdcc1550.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"ijr.com","author":"Grace Niewijk","date":"2018-11-12T21:00:14.331+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ijr.com/"}}
