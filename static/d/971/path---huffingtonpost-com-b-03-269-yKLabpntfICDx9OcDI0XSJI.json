Verizon Media Group also owns the Yahoo and AOL digital brands. </p>\n<p>The site generates revenue through advertisements and sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Huffingtonpost.com publishes articles, podcasts, videos, and photos on national and global news, politics, entertainment, sports, and lifestyle topics like parenting, wellness, and travel. HuffPost publishes more than a dozen international editions in addition to its U.S. website. Pieces have a casual, buzzy style and often reflect liberal opinions, such as a news piece titled “Trump’s Efforts To Scare Away Immigrants Aren’t Working Very Well” and an opinion piece titled “The Lasting Damage of Trump’s Disastrous Diplomacy.”</p>\n<p>Some articles are written by HuffPost staff. Other pieces are posted from other news organizations, such as the Reuters wire service and Mother Jones magazine.</p>\n<p>The site previously published news, satire, and opinion stories from thousands of unpaid contributors, but it ended the contributor program in January 2018, citing concerns about the potential for false news to be published. </p>\n<p>The site’s Communities sections feature stories relevant to LGBT, female, Latino, black, and Asian communities. HuffPost also features ambitious special sections, including Highline, a section publishing in-depth, magazine-style articles, and Project Zero, an effort to publish stories that raise awareness of tropical diseases. </p>\n<p>HuffPost’s tagline is “Know what’s real.” Its YouTube account describes itself as “the world's premier progressive media platform,” telling stories “by shining light on truth and exposing absurdities and lies.” The site does not explicitly describe itself as liberal. When asked about HuffPost’s disclosure of its perspective, Lydia Polgreen, editor in chief of HuffPost, told NewsGuard, “HuffPost's mission statement begins ‘We are for the people, not the powerful.’ Accordingly, our journalism is guided by the needs and concerns of ordinary people — not political parties or any specific ideology.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>HuffPost says that it employs more than 500 editorial staff members globally, including 200 who work on its U.S. edition. Articles are well sourced. Originally reported stories are based on firsthand interviews, and news reported by other organizations is attributed. The site won a Pulitzer Prize in 2012 for David Wood’s series on wounded war veterans. In 2017, the site’s examination of the refugee crisis afflicting large segments of the world won a National Magazine Award and other honors. </p>\n<p>HuffPost has made recent efforts to invest in locally based  journalism. During the site’s 2017 Listen to America Tour, it conducted 1,700 interviews in 25 cities to learn how to expand its reporting to new regions. Ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, HuffPost will use a similar strategy to cover local events in six cities in the western U.S.</p>\n<p>The site contains a separate Opinion section with clearly labeled commentary. Some opinion stories, however, run outside of this section. For example, a May 2018 story in the politics section, titled “The Caliphate Of Trump And A Planet In Ruins,” compared President Donald Trump’s following to “a new kind of death cult.”</p>\n<p>Some articles insert opinion, such as a July 2018 story titled “Steve King Is A White Supremacist, And The GOP Doesn’t Care.” The story called it “surprising, and concerning” that no Republicans had pushed to censure the Iowa congressman for retweeting an anti-immigration message from a neo-Nazi sympathizer. Other headlines of stories that were not labeled as opinion include, “GOP Senator Offers The Craziest Theory For Why Trump Didn’t Stand Up To Putin.” A 2018 story about three Kansas men convicted in a terror plot against Muslim refugees ran with a photo of Trump pumping a fist in front of photographs of the men, although Trump did not express support for them.</p>\n<p>HuffPost’s story selection results in coverage that is mostly sympathetic to liberal causes or critical of conservative ones even though the site never explicitly acknowledges a liberal agenda. The front page on July 19, 2018, for example, featured approximately 20 political stories, with nearly all focused on Republicans or criticism of the Trump administration. One of those stories was about former Democratic President Barack Obama speaking about women in politics. </p>\n<p>Because Huffingtonpost.com does not clearly disclose a liberal perspective, and inserts left-leaning opinions into some articles presented as news, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not responsibly handle the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<p>Asked by NewsGuard about the site’s use of opinion in news articles and headlines, Polgreen stated, \"Our reporting is based on facts and a search for truth. We are not afraid to draw conclusions from our reporting or call things as we see them. We often provide context for our readers so they can better understand the issues, or why something is significant. We practice rigorous and fair journalism to hold power to account.\"</p>\n<p>The Huffington Post undermined the credibility of its otherwise professional reporting through its coverage of Trump during his candidacy for the 2016 American presidential election. In 2015, the site tagged all stories relating to him as “entertainment” news. In 2016, the site appended an editor’s note to every story about Trump, describing him as “a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, and birther.” HuffPost stopped the editor’s note after Trump was elected president in November 2016. Former Washington bureau chief Ryan Grim said in a memo to readers that the site would respect the results of the election.</p>\n<p>Polgreen, speaking at a media conference in February 2018, said she would not have chosen to designate stories about Trump as “entertainment” had she been at Huffington Post at the time.“I would take a different approach, personally, as a journalist,” she said.</p>\n<p>Articles contain a link at the bottom encouraging readers to report errors. The site provides a central email address for corrections, and when stories are updated, a note outlining the change appears at the bottom.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>HuffPost’s ownership is disclosed at the bottom of the site and on its About page, although as of mid-January 2019 the name change from Oath to Verizon Media Group had not appeared yet. Stories often contain bylines with the author’s name, their photo, and a link to biographical information and other published work. Top editors are listed in the site’s About Us section. Biographical and contact information for editors are generally available to users who click on their byline. </p>\n<p>The Contact Us section offers several ways for readers to share tips, report errors, pitch stories for the Opinions and HuffPost Personal sections, and make other inquiries.</p>\n<p>The site clearly labels advertisements, although some advertisers post stories that are designed to look like the rest of the content on huffingtonpost.com. Those stories are clearly marked and disclose the sponsor’s name.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Author and commentator Arianna Huffington, conservative writer Andrew Breitbart, businessman Kenneth Lerer, and entrepreneur Jonah Peretti founded the site in 2005. The site was started as a liberal alternative to the conservative news site, The Drudge Report. Breitbart, who worked for the Drudge Report for years, left Huffington Post within months and founded the conservative site Breitbart.com that year. Polgreen, formerly editorial director and associate masthead editor at The New York Times overseeing the news organization’s global expansion, took over as editor after Huffington left in August 2016. </p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label mischaracterized a description of Iowa U.S. Rep. Steve King in a July 2018 article. The article’s author wrote that it was “surprising” that King faced no political consequences for retweeting a neo-Nazi sympathizer’s remarks.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah
