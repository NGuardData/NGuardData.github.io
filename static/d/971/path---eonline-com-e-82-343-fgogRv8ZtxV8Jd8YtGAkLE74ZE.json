Shows, television, music and film news, and celebrity lifestyles, including couples, babies, homes, beauty and fitness.</p>\n<p>A livestream of the cable TV channel is available from the site for subscribers.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Text and video stories are produced by staff. Stories often report casting or celebrity news by quoting unnamed sources, or with citations like “E! News has learned ...’’ It has also relied on secondary sources, such as its NBC parent, along with sites like TMZ that often publish anonymously sourced reports without much elaboration.</p>\n<p>Headlines speak in tabloid gossip style: “Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom Cozy Up for a Selfie at   Colosseum in Rome,” or “Chrissy Teigen and John Legend Celebrate at Baby Shower with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site does not provide information about who’s in charge, but executive biographies can be found on the NBCUniversal website. The site allows user comments at the end of each news story. The FAQ page offers an email feedback link, but does not make clear how errors might be corrected.  </p>\n<p>Editors at Eonline.com and representatives of NBCUniversal, E's owner, did not respond to six emails from NewsGuard seeking information on how the site makes corrections, how to reach content creators, and its standards for using anonymous sources.</p>\n<p>Authors’ names are listed on the site without background information. Advertisements appear separate from news content. The site offers a program that lets users control the ads they see.</p>\n<p>Eonline.com is ad-supported, deploying video ads, display ads, and sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The E! Network went on the air in 1987, when it was called Movietime, airing awards and entertainment news and film trailers. It changed its name to E! In 1990 and became known for shows including <em>Talk Soup</em>, and <em>Fashion Police</em>, with irreverent reviews anchored by comedian Joan Rivers, and reality series.</p>\n<p>EOnline debuted as a site in the 1990s and was rebranded to its current format in 2012. Ryan Seacrest, former host of E! News, remains executive producer of the red-carpet programs.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nStu Rohrer\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.eonline.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eonline.com/about</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nbcumv.com/programming/e-entertainment/e-news/about\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nbcumv.com/programming/e-entertainment/e-news/about</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nbcumv.com/programming/e-entertainment/exec-bios?network=33136\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nbcumv.com/programming/e-entertainment/exec-bios?network=33136</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nbcumv.com/executive/adam-stotsky/bios_read_more?division=1&network=33136\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nbcumv.com/executive/adam-stotsky/bios<em>read</em>more?division=1&#x26;network=33136</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ebizmba.com/articles/gossip-websites\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.ebizmba.com/articles/gossip-websites</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"eonline.com","author":"Stu Rohrer","date":"2018-07-20T14:06:19.533+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/eonline.com/"}}
