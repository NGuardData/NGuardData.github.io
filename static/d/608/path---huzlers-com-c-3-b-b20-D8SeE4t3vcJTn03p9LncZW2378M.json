Huzlers does not identify Reyes as the owner on its website, but Reyes has confirmed his ownership in interviews with media outlets, including NewsGuard.  </p>\n<p>The website earns revenue through advertising and sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Huzlers states at the bottom of the website, “Huzlers is the most infamous fauxtire &#x26; satire entertainment website in the world. If it's trending on social media you'll find it here!” Reyes told NewsGuard in a phone interview that Huzlers’ aims to be “the ghetto Onion,” referring to the popular satire site.</p>\n<p>Huzlers stories, which do not individually carry such a disclaimer, often portray celebrities and others in trouble or in extreme distress. One fake story included a report that pop star Justin Bieber escaped from jail after being arrested for drag racing and driving while intoxicated. Another made-up story, headlined “Man Hospitalized After His Apple Airpods Exploded In His Ear,” describes the plight of a Arizona man recovering after “watching pornography when his Airpods exploded.”</p>\n<p>Other stories cover urban issues, such as one headlined “World Gun Violence Has Been Reportedly Declining Since Apple’s Gun Emoji Change In 2016.” The story states that there were “only 900 gun related crimes in 2017, and an all time low of only 5 gun related crimes so far in 2018. … Researchers predict that 2019 will have only 1 gun related crime.”</p>\n<p>Asked about the site’s publication of stories that can be mistaken for real, Pablo Reyes told Newsguard: “Somebody that just comes to the site for the first time probably won’t know what the site is about.” However, Reyes said the site’s regular visitors understand Huzlers’ brand and purpose. “It’s just a comedy site. Everyone on there is just meant to be a joke,” he said.</p>\n<p>Huzlers.com also publishes satirical articles from other websites, including Reductress.com, 8satire.com and CollegeHumor.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>According to an analysis by BuzzFeed News, nine stories by Huzlers were in the top 50 most widely engaged false-news articles on Facebook in 2018. The popular fake stories involved a Florida man arrested for “tranquilizing alligators in the everglades and then raping them;” a man dying from E. Coli after performing a sex act on his girlfriend; and a Florida man who burned down his house while attempting to burn a pair of Nike sneakers to protest the company’s relationship with ex-NFL player Colin Kaepernick.</p>\n<p>Many of the site’s stories have misled people. A 2015 article titled “McDonald’s Employee Fired For Placing His Mixtapes in Children’s Happy Meals” was posted on New York City radio station WWPR-FM’s website before the site noted it as a fake story. A 2017 Huzlers story about a man arrested for running a scam selling Chuck E. Cheese tokens as bitcoins was debunked on Gizmodo.com — after the story was widely shared on social media. The fact-checking site Snopes saw fit to debunk a popular Huzlers article in 2018 about the discovery of thousands of Coors Light beer cans laced with cocaine. The Associated Press contacted the Food and Drug Administration, which denied the report.</p>\n<p>Headlines for the site do not inform readers that Huzlers articles are intended to be satirical, which can create confusion when the articles are shared on social media. “We’ve built a reputation already, sort of, in our community, and those are the people who share our articles,” Reyes said. “They know they’re not true, they know they’re meant just to be funny.”  </p>\n<p>Huzlers will remove a story if the site is contacted by anyone who was mistakenly mentioned in the article, Reyes said. Otherwise, the site does not run corrections or updates, he said.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Huzlers.com does not attribute stories to authors and does not identify its writers. The site does not list any managers, editors, or owners. It also does provide an email address or phone number for users seeking to contact the site.</p>\n<p>Advertising generally is distinguished from editorial content. However, Reyes acknowledged that some articles are paid for by advertisers, although they are not labeled as paid or sponsored content. For example, a story headlined “7 Of The Luckiest Casino Wins Ever” was paid for by the casinos mentioned in the article.</p>\n<p>Asked how someone would know such articles were in fact ads, Reyes said regular Huzlers readers would be able to distinguish it based on tone and content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Huzlers.com was founded in 2013 by Reyes, with the name inspired by the pornographic magazine. “It comes from Hustler because I like the owner [Larry Flynt] that started Hustler,” Reyes told NewsGuard. Reyes said he liked the “crazy, crazy stuff” Flynt wrote in the magazine. </p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: Upon further review, NewsGuard has determined that Huzlers should be rated as a news site, not a satire site, because its </em><em>stories have been widely shared, have misled users, and are not labeled as satire when encountered on social media or in search results</em><em>. NewsGuard has updated this Nutrition Label to rate the website according to its n</em><em>ine criteria. </em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJoe Danielewicz\n\nEdited by:\nAmy
