The newspaper is also affiliated with six other publications, including a Spanish weekly and a business publication.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The website features local and national news, sports and opinion content. Video clips are prominently displayed on the site and on-demand news video content is available. The Review-Journal offers robust crime and business reporting and has separate sections on the marijuana industry (“Pot”), education, and a page dedicated to the Oct. 1, 2017, mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival that killed 58 people.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Headlines and images accurately reflect content. The site regularly attributes sources of information and photographs. Stories include primary sources. The newspaper has a robust staff of reporters and editors. The Review-Journal staff received a Sigma Delta Chi Award for deadline reporting from the Society of Professional Journalists in 2018 for its coverage of the Las Vegas shooting. Staffer Karisa King was listed as a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 2017 for investigative reporting for her work on questionable prescription drug combinations.</p>\n<p>The site regularly notes corrections, updating the story to correct it and describing the error in italicized notes at the end of articles.</p>\n<p>The change of ownership to Adelson led to resignations at the newspaper in 2016, and criticism that management promoted the owner’s political and business interests, including the creation of a football stadium in the city proposed by a company owned by Adelson. Reporters said they were also instructed to monitor judges involved with an Adelson lawsuit, and editors began reviewing all articles related to Adelson after the sale,  National Public Radio and The New York Times reported.</p>\n<p>Review-Journal Executive Editor Glenn Cook told NewsGuard in an email that the Review Journal’s owners “are not involved in the direction or operation of the newsroom,” and that stories involving the owners or their business interests “disclose their ownership at the bottom of the story.”</p>\n<p>Several stories, including news on a new restaurant opening on an Adelson casino property, or the appointment of Adelson’s wife, Miriam, as publisher of a newspaper in Israel, do include such a disclosure.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Bylines, staff biographies and contact information for reporters are clearly listed on the site. Ownership information is not listed directly on the website, although the newspaper’s editors disclose who owns the newspaper at the bottom of every story it writes about Adelson.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The newspaper was created in 1909 as the <em>Clark County Review</em>. It launched its website in 1997.  </p>\n<p>In 2016, the newspaper became one of the first in the country to endorse Donald Trump’s presidential bid.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJennie Kamin\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/02/sheldon-adelson-tightens-grip-on-review-journal-004384\">https://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/02/sheldon-adelson-tightens-grip-on-review-journal-004384</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/02/sheldon-adelson-tightens-grip-on-review-journal-004384\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/02/sheldon-adelson-tightens-grip-on-review-journal-004384</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/business/media/another-journalist-quits-las-vegas-newspaper-bought-by-sheldon-adelson.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/business/media/another-journalist-quits-las-vegas-newspaper-bought-by-sheldon-adelson.html</a></h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/business/media/another-journalist-quits-las-vegas-newspaper-bought-by-sheldon-adelson.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/business/media/another-journalist-quits-las-vegas-newspaper-bought-by-sheldon-adelson.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/23/business/media/in-adelsons-newsroom-looser-purse-strings-and-a-tighter-leash.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/23/business/media/in-adelsons-newsroom-looser-purse-strings-and-a-tighter-leash.html</a></h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/23/business/media/in-adelsons-newsroom-looser-purse-strings-and-a-tighter-leash.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/23/business/media/in-adelsons-newsroom-looser-purse-strings-and-a-tighter-leash.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/adelsons-attorney-says-billionaire-doesnt-own-israel-hayom/\">http://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/adelsons-attorney-says-billionaire-doesnt-own-israel-hayom/</a></h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/adelsons-attorney-says-billionaire-doesnt-own-israel-hayom/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/adelsons-attorney-says-billionaire-doesnt-own-israel-hayom/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/05/09/477423367/more-journalists-leaving-las-vegas-review-journal-after-sale-to-billionaire\">https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/05/09/477423367/more-journalists-leaving-las-vegas-review-journal-after-sale-to-billionaire</a></h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/05/09/477423367/more-journalists-leaving-las-vegas-review-journal-after-sale-to-billionaire\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/05/09/477423367/more-journalists-leaving-las-vegas-review-journal-after-sale-to-billionaire</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/02/sheldon-adelson-tightens-grip-on-review-journal-004384\">https://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/02/sheldon-adelson-tightens-grip-on-review-journal-004384</a></h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/02/sheldon-adelson-tightens-grip-on-review-journal-004384&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/02/sheldon-adelson-tightens-grip-on-review-journal-004384         </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/judge-in-adelson-lawsuit-subject-to-unusual-scrutiny-amid-review-journal-sale/\">https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/judge-in-adelson-lawsuit-subject-to-unusual-scrutiny-amid-review-journal-sale/</a></h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/judge-in-adelson-lawsuit-subject-to-unusual-scrutiny-amid-review-journal-sale/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/judge-in-adelson-lawsuit-subject-to-unusual-scrutiny-amid-review-journal-sale/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"reviewjournal.com","author":"Jennie Kamin","date":"2018-08-24T09:46:05.892+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/reviewjournal.com/"}}
