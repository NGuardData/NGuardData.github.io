News Communications is a newspaper and magazine business centered in New York City and Long Island’s the Hamptons, founded in 1986.</p>\n<p>James A. Finkelstein, chairman of Capitol Hill Publishing Corp. (as well as chairman, CEO, and president of News Communications), told Bloomberg in 2017 that The Hill’s revenue is “virtually all advertising.” The site also solicits sponsorships for events it hosts.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Hill describes itself as “a complete and comprehensive source of Congressional news.” “The Hill serves to connect the players, define the issues and engage Washington's decision makers in the debate,” its About page continues.</p>\n<p>The site covers Congress, political campaigns, international relations, and federal policy, in articles and videos. The site also contains an extensive Opinion section, featuring columns from a range of contributors, some of whom are members of Congress.</p>\n<p>The Hill considers itself nonpartisan, and Finkelstein has said that the site strives to balance each liberal opinion piece with a conservative one. Once read primarily in Washington, The Hill expanded its web coverage to attract a national audience and will, Finkelstein has said, likely phase out its print publication at some point.</p>\n<p>In June 2018, The Hill introduced Hill.TV, its digital video news service. Its main programs include What America’s Thinking, which covers the results of recent public opinion polls, and Rising, which features news analysis from Buck Sexton, a conservative talk show host, and Krystal Ball, a former co-host for MSNBC’s The Cycle.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>TheHill.com publishes content from an extensive list of contributors, including staff journalists and members of Congress who submit opinion pieces. Reporters conduct original interviews and attribute some information to news sources such as The New York Times and CNN. Headlines are straightforward and representative of content. When the site posts an error, it updates the relevant content with new information and clarifies what changed, typically in an italicized note at the bottom.</p>\n<p>Opinion pieces run in a separate, labeled section, which states at the top “the views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill.” Headlines in this section sometimes  start with the author’s name, such as “Juan Williams: Tech companies must be defanged by government,” and bylines usually state “opinion contributor” after the author’s name. </p>\n<p>The Hill has been criticized for publishing opinion pieces written by lobbyists without disclosing their financial interests. One piece by former Republican Senator Norm Coleman, praising President Donald Trump’s exit from the Iran nuclear deal, did not note Coleman’s role as a paid lobbyist for the government of Saudi Arabia, Iran’s major rival. A pro-Turkey piece by Michael T. Flynn, Trump’s short-lived national security adviser, did not disclose Flynn’s consulting work for a company with ties to the Turkish government. In response to criticism, The Hill updated both articles by explaining the financial interests of both men, and said in an editor’s note about the Flynn article that “neither General Flynn nor his representatives disclosed this information when the essay was submitted.” The Hill did not respond to four emails and a voicemail from NewsGuard seeking comment on these stories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site provides an extensive masthead on its About page, which lists its leadership, editorial staff, and business staff. Some names on the site’s masthead link to a page with the staff member’s photo, Twitter handle, and a directory of their work. A separate Contact Us page also provides email addresses for general inquiries. </p>\n<p>Most articles name their author in a byline at the top, and usually link to the author’s profile page. Opinion columns also typically provide the author’s brief biography. </p>\n<p>Advertisements are distinguished from editorial content, and sponsored content is labeled.</p>\n<p>Although theHill.com names Finkelstein as its chairman, the site does not centrally disclose ownership, only naming Capitol Hill Publishing Corp. and News Communications in a small copyright disclosure on the bottom of the site. The Hill did not respond to two emails seeking comment on its lack of a clear ownership disclosure.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>News Communications founded The Hill in 1994. According to a New York Times article at the time, the newspaper was intended to compete with Roll Call, which also covers Congress and politics. Jerry Finkelstein, whose holdings also included the New York Law Journal, served as The Hill’s chairman when it was first published. Finkelstein died in 2012. James A. Finkelstein, one of his sons, became chairman of the publication.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label erroneously stated that The Hill is a daily newspaper. The Hill publishes a print newspaper three days a week when Congress is in session and once a week when Congress is out of session.</em></p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This Nutrition Label has been updated, and the rating has been changed to reflect that The Hill does not meet NewsGuard’s standards for clearly disclosing ownership.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n\nEdited
