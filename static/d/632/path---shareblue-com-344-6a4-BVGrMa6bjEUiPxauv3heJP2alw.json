Brock is the founder of Media Matters for America, a nonprofit media watchdog website that monitors and investigates conservative news outlets it says spread misinformation. </p>\n<p>Brock also ran pro-Hillary Clinton super PACs and launched the anti-Republican American Bridge 21st Century Super PAC, and its nonprofit arm, the American Bridge 21st Century Foundation.</p>\n<p>The organization that is now Shareblue was formerly known as BlueNationReview.com, but relaunched in 2016 ahead of the U.S. presidential election. He bought BlueNationReview.com from MOKO Social Media Limited, an Australian media company, at the end of 2015. </p>\n<p>The site runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Shortly after the 2016 election, Brock said he hoped Shareblue could become the “Breitbart of the left,” referring to the right-leaning news site. A memo leaked in 2017 that was distributed to the funders of Brock’s various liberal groups said Shareblue would “take back social media for Democrats.”</p>\n<p>“We will delegitimize Donald Trump's presidency by emboldening the opposition and empowering the majority of Americans who oppose him,” the memo said.</p>\n<p>During the 2016 election, ShareBlue promoted the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.  </p>\n<p>“The highest-trafficked item we ran in the whole campaign was an article titled ‘Hillary Is One of the Most Ethical (and Lied About) Political Leaders in America.’ That was shared more than 2 million times,” Brock told Vanity Fair in 2017. “We were making arguments for Hillary and they were factual arguments, but they had an emotional tenor to them. And I think the something that’s missing in a lot of liberal communications: They’re dry and fact-driven. But people want more than just facts.\"</p>\n<p>The New York Times noted in 2016 that Shareblue’s “editorial direction seems in sync with the Clinton campaign,” and the site often attacked Clinton’s opponent in the 2016 Democratic primaries, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.</p>\n<p>The site divides coverage into national, local, elections, grassroots, and culture sections. Stories are often attacks on Republicans, conservatives, and President Trump.  The site mostly features critical coverage of the Trump administration, with some features on state and federal elections. Even the Culture section features an overwhelming majority of stories with “Trump” in the headline.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Shareblue writers rarely conduct firsthand reporting. Their stories do not include outreach to sources on the other side of an issue. Writers add an anti-Trump perspective in text and headlines of stories that are based on other news outlets’ reporting, and often treat opinion as fact.</p>\n<p>For example, a July 2018 story with the headline “Trump’s Putin meeting gets one rave review -- from a former Klansman” highlighted former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke’s positive  tweets about Trump’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland. The story’s author declared that Duke’s support of Trump highlights “the type of person most drawn to Trump’s presidency.” </p>\n<p>A June 2018 story ran with the headline: “All of these rights are at stake if Trump rigs the Supreme Court,” implying Trump’s constitutionally required duty to fill a Supreme Court vacancy was “rigging” the Court. Another story about Republican Representative Mark Sanford losing a primary election in June 2018 ran with the headline: “Infamously sleazy GOP congressman loses primary, putting seat in play.”</p>\n<p>Other content is misleading and leaves out context. For example, in December 2017, the site ran a story with the headline: “Trump hosted the NRA at the White House on the anniversary of Sandy Hook massacre.” But as fact-checking site Snopes pointed out, Trump did not “host the NRA” but instead invited NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre, among many other people, to a White House holiday party that happened to fall on December 14, the anniversary of the elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 20 children and six adults. </p>\n<p>Blue Nation Review had covered Sanders positively until Brock bought the site in late 2015. In early 2016, the tone of the site’s Sanders coverage became predominantly negative. The shift began when Blue Nation Review ran a story in January 2016 titled “With Bernie Sanders As Their Nominee, Democrats Can Kiss The Presidency Goodbye.” Other negative stories about Sanders followed, including one titled ‘Why Does Bernie Sanders Keep Denigrating Hillary’s Supporters?” Later that year, the site relaunched as Share Blue.</p>\n<p>The New York Times reported that Brock’s American Bridge 21st Century Foundation spent $200,000 in an attempt to bring forward sexual misconduct claims against Trump before the 2016 presidential election. Shareblue has published stories about widely reported sexual misconduct accusations against Trump, without disclosing Brock’s involvement. Trump has denied the accusations. </p>\n<p>A review of the site found although Shareblue.com republishes corrections from outlets it cites. However, NewsGuard could not find instances of Shareblue correcting its own stories. There is no corrections policy on the site. </p>\n<p>NewsGuard has concluded the site does not gather and present information responsibly, based on its lack of balance in reporting, even from a liberal perspective, and also does not separate news and opinion responsibly in its content.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard sent three messages through the site’s contact portal asking about corrections, the site’s lack of disclosure about its ownership, its misleading headlines, its distortion of facts to advance opinions, and the way to contact editors and writers. NewsGuard also sent two direct messages through Twitter to ShareBlue’s managing editor. NewsGuard has not received a response from ShareBlue. The site does not list a phone number. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The copyright statement at the bottom of the site indicates that the site is owned by True Blue Media LLC, but doesn’t mention that the owner is Brock.</p>\n<p>Although the name of the site suggests its Democratic leanings, the site does not disclose a political affiliation. Instead, the site describes itself as an “American media company,” adding that they “tell real-world stories to give voice to the heroes fighting for American values.” </p>\n<p>The Company page lists biographies for management and reporters. Reporters and editors have brief biographies, some of which describe connections to Democratic party committees and politicians. However, the site does not provide emails addresses for reporters and editors, and does not reveal Brock’s role. </p>\n<p>NewsGuard sent three messages through the site’s contact portal asking about corrections, the site’s lack of disclosure of ownership, its misleading headlines, its distortion of facts to advance opinions, and the way to contact editors and writers. NewsGuard also sent two direct messages through Twitter to ShareBlue’s managing editor. NewsGuard has not received a response from ShareBlue. The site does not list a phone number. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site’s predecessor, Blue Nation Review, launched in 2014 and was originally known for reporting on the finances and spending habits of Illinois Republican Congressman Aaron Schock, who eventually resigned from Congress for misusing campaign and federal funds. Brock relaunched the site as ShareBlue in 2016.</p>\n<p>Brock is a former conservative journalist who spent the 1990s investigating the Clintons. In 1993 he published a piece in the American Spectator that delved deeply into Bill Clinton’s personal life, and ultimately helped trigger the investigation into Clinton’s relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Five years later, Brock wrote a piece for Esquire, detailing his regrets about the story.</p>\n<p><em>Corrections: A previous version of this label incorrectly referred to Wayne LaPierre as president of the NRA; he is CEO. The label also misstated which of David Brock’s organizations funded research into sexual misconduct claims against Donald Trump; it was the American Bridge 21st Century Foundation. The label has also been updated to reflect that Shareblue does provide some staff contact information in the form of Twitter handles. Finally, the label incorrectly reported the date that Blue Nation Review launched; the correct year is 2014.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJosh Keefe\n\nEdited by:\nAmy
