In its 2016-17 IRS filings, the outlet reported receiving $1.5 million in contributions and grants, accounting for approximately 83 percent of its revenue for that year.</p>\n<p>In addition to donations, High Country News generates revenue from subscriptions, syndication, and advertisements in its website and print magazine, which publishes twice a month.. Nonsubscribers can only access limited content online.</p>\n<p>Donors to High Country News, which are listed in its 2018 annual report, include The Fund for Environmental Journalism, the PAGE Foundation, the Ford Foundation, NRG Inc., and the Patagonia clothing company.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>High Country News says it covers “the American West’s public lands, water, natural resources, grazing, wilderness, wildlife, logging, politics, communities, growth and other issues now changing the face of the West.”</p>\n<p>Articles generally consist of reporting, analysis, or commentary on environmental and land use matters in the western United States. The site divides content into sections that include Features, Climate, Public Lands, Energy &#x26; Industry, Tribal Affairs, and Immigration. Each print magazine issue publishes features on a particular issue, such as nuclear power, the mining industry, and migration patterns in Western states. The magazine’s final issue of 2018 explored the future of local journalism in less-populated areas in the West.</p>\n<p>HCN.Org also hosts online archives of High Country News issues dating back to its first issue in 1970.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>High Country News articles are based on original reporting and reference experts, residents, government documents, and on-the-scene reporting and images. Headlines on the website accurately represent the content of their articles. The website regularly publishes corrections, typically in a note at the bottom of the affected article.</p>\n<p>The site identifies opinion content as either “Opinion,” “Perspective,” or “Analysis.” Its coverage does not convey support for a particular political party, but states a “commitment to environmental stewardship, diversity and social responsibility.” This mission statement often leads the site’s opinion articles to portray the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the Republican Party in a critical light.  However, news articles, while regularly reporting on issues that portray Trump unflatteringly, typically avoid making value judgments and do not include the writer’s opinions.</p>\n<p>The publication has won several journalism awards, including six first-place awards in 2018 for tribal coverage from the Native American Journalists Association. It has also received a  2016 award for beat reporting from the Society of Environmental Journalists, and an award for magazine writing from the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences in 2017.</p>\n<p>High Country News has also won two George Polk Awards: one in 1986 for environmental reporting and one in 2006 for political reporting.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles consistently name their authors. The site’s About Us section features an extensive Staff page that identifies High Country News’ editors and authors, provides their biographies, and discloses contact information. The same section also provides the names and biographical information for High Country News’ Board of Directors.</p>\n<p>High Country News names the majority of its donors in its annual reports, and stresses in the ethics policy listed in its About Us section that the outlet’s “news judgments are made independently and not on the basis of donor support.”</p>\n<p>The site also states that it “will accept anonymous donations for general support only if it is clear that sufficient safeguards have been put into place that the expenditure of that donation is made independently by our organization and in compliance with [Institute for Nonprofit News] Membership Standards.”</p>\n<p>High Country News’ editor-in-chief, Brian Calvert, told NewsGuard that the outlet has a policy of disclosing donors when there may be a conflict of interest, and provided two such examples of disclosures.</p>\n<p>Anonymous donations to High Country News are noted in the organization’s Annual Reports with the word “Anonymous,” followed by the number of anonymous donations received that year.</p>\n<p>Advertisements on the site are distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>High Country News, formerly known as “Camping News Weekly,” was founded in 1970 by a Wyoming teacher, rancher, and wildlife biologist named Tom Bell, who wanted to inform readers about looming environmental crises in the American West.  </p>\n<p>By 1990, the publication’s coverage had caught the attention of regional lawmakers. Colorado U.S. Sen. Tim Wirth “read it cover to cover,” the Rocky Mountain News reported at the time, and aides clipped articles from the publication for Wyoming’s U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson.</p>\n<p>The outlet’s website launched in 1995.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBron Maher\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Amy
