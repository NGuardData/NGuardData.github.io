It also owns the Houston Press, Denver Westword and Phoenix New Times. Revenue comes from classified and display advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Miaminewtimes.com publishes guides to restaurants, movies, musical performances, art shows, and other cultural events, as well as lists of both places to go and performance reviews. News coverage is produced by a full-time staff and contributing authors. It includes investigative reports, such as an August 2018 examination of arrests made by the Miami-Dade police for minor marijuana violations, and how they cost taxpayers millions of dollars.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>All articles, whether written by staff or contributing writers, include the author’s bylines.</p>\n<p>The site publishes many performance and gallery reviews, but clearly distinguishes between news and opinion. Headlines accurately reflect article content. The site labels articles that have been updated for inaccuracies and with new information.</p>\n<p>Miami New Times has won many journalism awards. In 2007 Investigative Reporters &#x26; Editors awarded a first place prize to reporter Isaiah Thompson for reporting on people living under bridges in Miami. In 2011 the paper was awarded the Society of Professional Journalists' Sigma Delta Chi first-place award in public service journalism for exposing the abuse by private schools of a state voucher program. In 2014, managing editor Tim Elfrink won a George Polk Award for disclosing how an anti-aging clinic in Coral Cables, Florida, supplied Major League Baseball stars with performance-enhancing drugs.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site lists all staff members and contributing authors, with biographical information for staff writers, as well as email and social media contact information for all writers. News and website managers are listed with contact information. Site management can be contacted by phone as well as email. Ownership by Voice Media Group is disclosed. Advertisements on the site are clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Miami New Times was founded in 1987 under the ownership of Village Voice Media, which rebranded an existing publication, The Wave. Following a management buyout in 2012 by three Village Voice Media executives, it became part of a newly formed Voice Media Group. Voice Media Group sold off New York’s Village Voice and other media properties following the buyout but retained Miami New Times and other publications. The website was registered in 1995.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nDan Cook\n\nEdited by:\nJim Warren&#x26;emsp;Yemile Bucay&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.miaminewtimes.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.miaminewtimes.com/about</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/25/business/media/new-times-will-buy-village-voice-media.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/25/business/media/new-times-will-buy-village-voice-media.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2012/09/24/denver-company-buying-village-voice-media-holdings-and-westword/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.denverpost.com/2012/09/24/denver-company-buying-village-voice-media-holdings-and-westword/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.voicemediagroup.com/who-we-are/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.voicemediagroup.com/who-we-are/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.miaminewtimes.com/about/staff\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.miaminewtimes.com/about/staff</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.miaminewtimes.com/authors/jerry-iannelli-8318884\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.miaminewtimes.com/authors/jerry-iannelli-8318884</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-man-guilty-of-bribing-ecuadorian-oil-officials-10725063\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-man-guilty-of-bribing-ecuadorian-oil-officials-10725063</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-cops-keep-arresting-pot-smokers-despite-ticket-ordinance-10671569\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-cops-keep-arresting-pot-smokers-despite-ticket-ordinance-10671569</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/juana-molina-at-north-beach-bandshell-miami-september-22-10716584\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/juana-molina-at-north-beach-bandshell-miami-september-22-10716584</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.miaminewtimes.com/about/privacy-policy\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.miaminewtimes.com/about/privacy-policy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wlrn.org/post/wlrns-alicia-zuckerman-receives-national-award-society-professional-journalists\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.wlrn.org/post/wlrns-alicia-zuckerman-receives-national-award-society-professional-journalists</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://archive.altweeklies.com/aan/miami-new-times-tim-elfrink-wins-polk-award/Article?oid=7561908\" target=\"_blank\">http://archive.altweeklies.com/aan/miami-new-times-tim-elfrink-wins-polk-award/Article?oid=7561908</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://noplacetohide.net/awards/ire-awards/winners/2007-ire-awards-winners/\" target=\"_blank\">https://noplacetohide.net/awards/ire-awards/winners/2007-ire-awards-winners/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"miaminewtimes.com","author":"Dan Cook","date":"2018-10-05T20:59:10.554+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/miaminewtimes.com/"}}
