Despite sharing a name, goodnewsnetwork.org is not connected to The Good News Network (known as GNNradio), which is a group of Christian radio stations that broadcasts in the southeastern U.S.</p>\n<p>The site is financed by online advertising and member donations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site describes itself as “an antidote to the barrage of negativity from the mainstream media.” </p>\n<p>A Good News section contains stories summarizing reports from other news outlets, such as National Public Radio and NBC News. Stories are divided into categories such as Heroes and Inspiring. Typical headlines include “Watch Baby Girl Laugh Hysterically Over a Dog Being Fed Popcorn” and “Woman Stunned to Find Out That ‘Anonymous’ Kidney Donor is Actually Her Best Friend.” </p>\n<p>A Good Talks section features “motivational videos and podcasts,” including many TED talks as well as original content. A separate Español section contains stories in Spanish. A Good Gifts section links to products on other websites that donate a portion of their sales to charity. “We simply link to their websites and don't actually sell anything ourselves,” Weis-Corbley confirmed to NewsGuard in an email.</p>\n<p>Stories are written by staff authors, freelancers, and contributors who are invited to submit story ideas through a form on the site. Weis-Crobley told NewsGuard that she or a site staff member  edit these submissions.</p>\n<p>“If there are details that need to be confirmed, we will do that, but since our site is for positive stories, there really aren't too many cases where caution is needed,” she said. “We might call people in the stories. Most times readers are just sending links to other news stories on the web.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site’s stories typically summarize events first reported elsewhere, usually by reputable organizations such as NPR or local television stations. Many articles cite and link to the original report or study referenced, although some stories do not attribute sources.</p>\n<p>Headlines and articles accurately represent facts, but authors sometimes add their own commentary, although the editorializing reflects the perspective that the site discloses.  “Step aside, dogs — goats may be man’s new best friend, according to a heartwarming new study,” an author asserted in an August 2018 article, for example.</p>\n<p>The site regularly publishes corrections, which appear in italics below the corrected article.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site states that it is a for-profit company. It names its owners and editors, providing photos and biographies for each. Most stories name writers and link to their profile page, but some authors’ names do not link to biographical information, and other stories are only attributed to Good News Network. </p>\n<p>Weis-Corbley told NewsGuard that the GNN byline originally meant she was the author, but now the staff byline is used more widely. She also said some guest writers are credited at the bottom of stories.</p>\n<p>A Contact page provides a phone number, a street address, and a form to submit inquiries.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Geri Weis-Corbley founded the website in 1997, “because the media was failing to report the positive news,” according to the site’s About page. GNN has been profiled in news outlets including CBS News and the Washington Post. The Post wrote in 2009 that “There are other web sites that aggregate good news from around the world, but few are as current, well kept and newsy as hers. She’s out to prove that good news sells.” Former Secretary of State Colin Powell also praised GNN in a quote highlighted on the site.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n\nEdited
