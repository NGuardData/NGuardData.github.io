Devin Nunes, a long-time Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from California’s 22nd Congressional District spanning Fresno and Tulare counties. Nunes has served in the House since 2003 and is seeking another term in November 2018. He currently serves as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and has been an outspoken supporter of President Trump, including on matters related to Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Carepublican.com contains articles highlighting positive developments in Nunes’ Central California district and attacking the Democratic Party, its supporters, and liberals more broadly. Mimicking a real news site, Carepublican.com contains short, local-news style articles about crime and other developments in the area, usually relying heavily on reporting from third-party news sources. Content is divided into pages focusing on national, state, and district-specific news, with separate pages dedicated to agriculture and water issues, as well as a Bulldog Blitz section, focusing on the California State University, Fresno, college football team. </p>\n<p>Some headlines on the site’s homepage link directly to stories on third-party news websites, such as the conservative Dailycaller.com. Other articles are largely copied from other sites, with credit at the bottom of the article -- such as a July 2018 piece ridiculing calls by some Democrats to abolish the federal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), which was originally published by National Review magazine. The site posts articles about Nunes himself relatively infrequently -- which serves to obscure the fact that it is a vehicle of the Nunes campaign. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The tone of articles on Carepublican.com shifts depending on the subject. Articles about positive developments in Nunes’s district are often presented in straightforward language. Articles attacking Nunes’ political opponents, on the other hand, tend to be strongly opinionated. Headlines reflect this distinction, ranging from the factual “Trump administration approves Central Valley water shortage plant,” to the overheated “Steven Crowder EXPOSES Antifa’s violent tactics.”</p>\n<p>Because the site selectively publishes news to boost one candidate -- cherry-picking facts and stories -- without clearly acknowledging its purpose, NewsGuard has concluded it does not gather and report news responsibly or appropriately handle the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<p>The site does not publish corrections, and does not provide readers a way to contact the site in case of an error.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard has not received a response from two messages sent through the site’s contact form about its editorial practices and lack of corrections policy.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Carepublican.com has the look and feel of a local news website. It does not prominently disclose that it is paid for by Nunes’s campaign, offering only a small print disclaimer at the foot of its homepage. On its Facebook page, the California Republican describes itself as a “media/news company” whose mission is “delivering the best of US, California, and Central Valley news, sports, and analysis.”</p>\n<p>The site offers no bylines or information on content creators and editors. Aside from linking to its Facebook page, the site does not offer contact details.</p>\n<p>Since Politico wrote a story about the site in February 2018, various media outlets and analysts have criticized Carepublican.com, along with other, similar sites set up by politicians, for a lack of transparency. “These websites are designed with one thing in mind: to trick the reader into thinking they’re a legitimate news source. And anyone who says otherwise is being disingenuous,” Aaron Sharockman, executive director of fact-checking website PolitiFact, told McClatchy News in July 2018. “A label tucked at the bottom of a web page isn’t enough.”</p>\n<p>Although the name of the site includes the word “Republican,” in and of itself that is not a clear indicator of its political leaning. Several nonpartisan local newspapers in the U.S. contain the word “Democrat” or “Republican” in their name.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard did not received a response to two messages sent through the site’s contact form about its lack of biographical or contact information about its content creators, leadership, and agenda.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Carepublican.com was first registered in June 2017. Politico reported in February 2018 that the URL was registered by a Fresno-area communications consultant, Alex Tavlian, whose company Sultana Media receives money from the Nunes campaign for “digital advertising management.” Reached by Politico, Tavlian said he registered a number of domains on Nunes’ behalf but does not manage Carepublican.com.</p>\n<p>For his part, Nunes has a fractious relationship with The Fresno Bee, a prominent local newspaper serving his district. The Bee<em> </em>called Nunes  “Trump’s stooge” in an editorial, and Nunes has called the Bee “a joke,” “a left-wing rag,” and, in a July 2018 political commercial, “a textbook example of fake news.”</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJon Allsop\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
