The group does not disclose its donors. The site runs display advertising and sponsored content. It also offers membership subscriptions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site publishes news, commentary, and opinion on U.S. politics and culture. Commentary, essays, and opinion articles are written from a perspective that opposes big government and foreign military intervention, and advocates for individual rights and what it considers traditional family values.</p>\n<p>In a 2018 piece titled “Don’t Replace Nikki Haley at the United Nations,” writer Danny Sjursen argued that having an ambassador at “a club we obviously don’t really want to be a part of” constitutes “a farce.” In another 2018 piece, “As Goes The Family…”, writer Rod Dreher argued that statistics showing fewer U.S. adults getting married and having children is a sign of a civilization in decline. “Nobody marries and has kids because it makes rational sense. If you don’t do it out of religious conviction, you do it because your culture has taught you that marriage and family are <em>primary goods</em> — that is, goods that don’t need to be justified, because they are good in and of themselves.”</p>\n<p>The site is not reflexively Republican or pro-President Trump. In an article titled “The Failing Trump Foreign Policy,” author Daniel Larison argued that compared to recent eras in U.S. history, “Trump came into office at a time of relative stability” in world affairs, but, he wrote, “Virtually every crisis that has involved the U.S. over the last year and a half has been of his own making.” A story titled “Birthright Citizenship: An American Idea That Works,” opposed certain limits on citizenship proposed by the Trump administration. Theamericanconservative.com regularly critiques conservatives. “Conservatives must acknowledge that too many of the poor are staying poor, no matter how hard they work,” stated a story titled “A Price Tag on the American Dream.” </p>\n<p>Content generally consists of long articles or blog posts. Blog posts are shorter and tend to contain less reporting and more commentary. A 2018 post titled “BBC To Identify Haters Within” provided commentary on a Times of London report that heterosexual BBC staff would be “asked to wear badges identifying themselves as ‘straight allies’” of LGBTQ staff. The post argued that people who did not want to identify as “allies” for religious reasons, but still treated LGBTQ co-workers with fairness and respect, could face discrimination.</p>\n<p>Longer articles included a two-part series on urban revitalization, “New Housing Can Spur Growth In Cities Left for Dead.” Writer Jason Segedy advocated for new housing projects in major Midwest cities, and against generally prevailing beliefs that demographic and industrial trends mandate that local governments at best can only smartly manage decline. “The Sad and Self-Inflicted Demise of Sears” responded to Sears Holdings’ decision to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy by maintaining that “America’s middle-class department store has been carved up and sold off by a soulless CEO,” Edward Lampert.</p>\n<p>Notable conservatives write for the site, including former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, who is one of the co-founders, and senior editor Dreher, author of “The Benedict Option,” which advocates that Christians withdraw from secular society and form religious communities. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site publishes serious, thoughtful, and in-depth articles, essays and commentary on politics and culture. It publishes corrections, either through “updates” at the bottom of the story, or adding corrections in the body of the article where an error was made. Headlines accurately reflect content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>All articles include the name of the author. A Contact Us page includes the email address and phone number for each staff member, and a general phone number and email for contacting managers. There are biographies of editorial staffers and an advisory board. If the author of an article is not a staff member, the site runs a brief biography at the bottom of the article. </p>\n<p>The site discloses ownership by the American Ideas Institute, and clearly discloses mission and viewpoint. An About page says The American Conservative “exists to promote a ‘Main Street’ conservatism that opposes unchecked power in government and business; promotes the flourishing of families and communities through vibrant markets and free people; and embraces realism and restraint in foreign affairs based on America’s vital national interests.” </p>\n<p>Advertising and sponsored content are differentiated from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The American Conservative was founded by Buchanan, Scott McConnell, and Taki Theodoracopulos in 2002 as a form of opposition to President George W. Bush and Republican Party support of the Iraq War. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nDan Cook\n\nEdited by:\nJosh Keefe&#x26;emsp;Jim
