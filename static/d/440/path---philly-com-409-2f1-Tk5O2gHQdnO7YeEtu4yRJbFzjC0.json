PMN has been owned by the Philadelphia Foundation since 2016, when former cable television executive and philanthropist H.F. Lenfest donated the company, converting the media properties to nonprofit status.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site covers local breaking news, politics, sports and culture, and includes local columns, profiles, real estate and entertainment. It includes articles on national, international and business news from The Associated Press wire service. The site includes web-only content as well as articles from the two print newspapers, including their liberal-leaning editorials. Philly.com blocks access to users who don’t pay a subscription fee after viewing a certain number of articles a month.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles on the site are fact-based, evenhanded and clearly sourced. The Inquirer has won the Pulitzer Prize 20 times. In 2012, it won in the Public Service category for a series of stories on violence in Philadelphia schools. In 2014, the Inquirer’s Inga Saffron won in the “Criticism” category for her reviews of architecture and design.</p>\n<p>The newspaper’s Pulitzer Prize winners include H.G. “Buzz” Bissinger, author of “Friday Night Lights”, Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele, and William Marimow, who has served as the top editor of the Inquirer, the Baltimore Sun and as vice president of news at National Public Radio.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site lists general contact information for reader feedback and has a section called “The Newsroom,” which lists beat reporters and leaders in every department and format at the company, with telephone numbers, email addresses and social media accounts. Writers’ email addresses are also linked to their bylines.</p>\n<p> It clearly identifies ads and differentiates between news and opinion writing. The company’s ownership is not easily accessible on the site, although the company has disclosed it.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Philadelphia Inquirer was founded under the name The Pennsylvania Inquirer in 1829, making it one of the oldest continuously produced newspapers in the U.S. The Daily News began publishing in the 1920s. Both newspapers were owned at various times by publisher Walter Annenberg, Knight-Ridder, the McClatchy chains and executive Brian Tierney. The site has been active since 1998, using content from both newspapers and producing online-only stories.</p>\n<p>The two Philadelphia newspapers, having had falling circulation and revenue struggles, suffered through periodic layoffs and several different owners. Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, which owned both newspapers and the digital operation, filed for bankruptcy in 2010 and was sold to a group of creditors and hedge funds before assuming its current ownership.</p>\n<p>The company was renamed Philadelphia Media Network after its bankruptcy filing.  </p>\n<p>In 2012, George Norcross, an insurance executive and a Democratic Party leader in New Jersey, teamed up with other investors, including Gerry Lenfest, to buy the company. A battle for control followed; in 2014, Lenfest and another investor, Lewis Katz, outbid the other co-owners at an auction and took over the company. Katz died that year in an airplane accident, and Lenfest purchased his stake in the company from Katz’s family.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEdith Honan\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/about/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/about/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/business/technology/New-editors-lead-papers-digital-frontiers.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.philly.com/philly/business/technology/New-editors-lead-papers-digital-frontiers.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20150825_Terry_Egger_named_publisher_of_Philadelphia_Media_Network.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20150825<em>Terry</em>Egger<em>named</em>publisher<em>of</em>Philadelphia<em>Media</em>Network.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20160112_Lenfest_donates_newspapers__website_to_new_media_institute.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20160112<em>Lenfest</em>donates<em>newspapers__website</em>to<em>new</em>media_institute.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/06/18/philadelphia-inquirer-now-has-one-owner-h-f-gerry-lenfest/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/06/18/philadelphia-inquirer-now-has-one-owner-h-f-gerry-lenfest/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20120416_Inquirer_wins_Pulitzer_Prize_for_school_violence_series.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20120416<em>Inquirer</em>wins<em>Pulitzer</em>Prize<em>for</em>school<em>violence</em>series.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/philadelphia-inquirer-0\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/philadelphia-inquirer-0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/inga-saffron\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/inga-saffron</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070219044935/http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/6135296.htm?1c\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.archive.org/web/20070219044935/http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/6135296.htm?1c</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about/press/060208.marimow.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.npr.org/about/press/060208.marimow.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"philly.com","author":"Edith Honan","date":"2018-07-20T14:04:57.608+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/philly.com/"}}
