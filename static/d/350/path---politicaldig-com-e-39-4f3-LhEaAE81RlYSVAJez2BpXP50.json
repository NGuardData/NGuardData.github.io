A confirmation message displayed after signing up for the site’s newsletter lists a Texas address. However, no businesses under the name Political Dig are registered in the state of Texas. </p>\n<p>The site generates revenue from advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Political Dig includes liberal commentary on U.S. political news, particularly on President Donald Trump’s actions and public remarks. The site does not include a mission statement on its website. The site’s Facebook page states that Political Dig “was born in the weeks before the 2016 election in an effort to counter the spread of misinformation promoted by Fox News and the Trump propaganda machine. Join the search for the truth on politicaldig.com.”</p>\n<p>Political Dig’s Facebook page, as well as a contact page on the website, includes a two-sentence statement that is copied from a page on The Associated Press’ corporate website, emphasizing a commitment to “transparency and accountability in government through freedom of information.” The Contact page on the website describes Political Dig as a “”must read” news website.”</p>\n<p>Its content generally consists of summaries of recent news reported by major national outlets like the Washington Post, BuzzFeed News, and Politico, often with added commentary. Content is divided into five main categories of coverage: News, Investigations, World, Fox Bite, which mainly contains summaries of recent interviews televised on Fox News, and Political Zen, which mainly contains stories that summarize comedians or others making fun of President Donald Trump. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Politicaldig.com publishes hyperpartisan commentary criticizing the Trump administration, Republicans, and mainstream media. Writers base news stories on social media posts, cable television news interviews, politicians’ public remarks and credible news sources such as The Washington Post and Reuters.</p>\n<p>News stories regularly insert liberal opinion, an overall perspective that the site does not disclose, which is why NewsGuard has determined the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.  </p>\n<p>For example, the author of a November 2018 post headlined “Trump Threatens Economic Apocalypse If Dems Take Back The House,” about a tweet from the president on stock market fluctuations, writes, “Nowhere in Trump’s tweet did he mention what experts say actually sunk the markets yesterday: anxiety over the likelihood the president is dumb enough to ramp up his self-defeating trade war by slapping tariffs on all Chinese imports, if his singular negotiating skills don’t yield any results when he meets with President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit next month.”  Another post, headlined “In Less Than 100 Days Trump Delivered These 5 Huge – The Best Ever — Accomplishments” is a sarcastic rundown of the president’s accomplishments, with examples such as “Successfully constructed a massive emotional wall between him and Melania.” Another article ran with the headline: “How Stupid Are Trumpsters? Bill Maher Exposed Them And It’s The Best Thing On The Internet.”</p>\n<p>Although Political Dig often cites the news stories or social media posts on which it bases its posts, NewsGuard also found several examples of articles that were apparently plagiarized from other news sources, which has led NewsGuard to determine the site does not gather and present information responsibly.</p>\n<p>For example, a November 2018 Political Dig story headlined “James Comey Just Backed Republicans Into a Corner With Bold Challenge To Hold Public Hearing” is almost identical to a story that appeared on The Hill website, headlined “Comey invites House Republicans to hold public hearing after news of possible subpoena.” The first paragraph of The Hill story reads, “Former FBI Director James Comey invited House Republicans to hold a public hearing following a report from The Hill on Friday that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) is planning to subpoena him to testify before Democrats take control of the committee.” The first paragraph of the PoliticalDig.com story, carrying the byline of a site writer, substituted the word “challenged” for “invited” and removed the words “from The Hill.”</p>\n<p>Another story, headlined “Senate And House Stand Up To Trump, Unanimously Pass Bill To Cut Tariffs On Hundreds Of Chinese Goods: Report,” copies most of the words in a Reuters story, titled “U.S. Senate quietly votes to cut tariffs on hundreds of Chinese goods.” While Political Dig links to the Reuters story in the article, the story is presented as if it were written by Political Dig’s staff.</p>\n<p>Political Dig does not post a corrections policy, and NewsGuard could not find examples of corrections issued in more than a year, which is why it has determined that the site does not regularly correct and clarify errors. Headlines use sensational language, but generally reflect the content of stories.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard contacted Political Dig, attempting to get comment on the site’s apparent plagiarism of other news outlets’ stories, its differentiation of news and opinion, and corrections policy in two emails and four Facebook messages. The site responded once through Facebook in a message signed by “political dig team,” and wrote that it would pass on NewsGuard’s inquiry to its editor, but NewsGuard did not receive a further response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Political Dig does not disclose information about its owners, editorial leaders, or most content creators. Stories are attributed to a small number of authors who do not have biographies or contact information on the site. The profile for one author, Ron DeLancer, includes a photograph that is an altered image of an actor named Michael Ealy.</p>\n<p>A contact page, which is not accessible from the homepage, has a general email for the editorial department, another email address for authors to submit opinion pieces, and DeLancer’s email address for advertising inquiries.</p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard contacted Political Dig, attempting to get comment on its lack of disclosure of owners, editors, or content creators in two emails and four Facebook messages. The site responded once through Facebook in a message signed by “political dig team,” and wrote that it would pass on NewsGuard’s inquiry to its editor, but NewsGuard did not receive an additional response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The web domain for Political Dig was created in 2014, according to WhoIS information from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
