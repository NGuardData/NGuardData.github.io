Entertainment Group, a subsidiary of WarnerMedia, which was known as Time Warner prior its June 2018 acquisition by telecommunications company AT&#x26;T.  A disclosure on the bottom of the website says toofab.com operates “in partnership with TMZ,” a tabloid website also owned by WarnerMedia. Toofab.com earns revenue from advertising.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Toofab.com produces a mix of written and visual content about celebrities, entertainment, style, and American pop culture, along with stories about the British royal family. Coverage is categorized as celebrity, fashion, television, movies, music, photos, and videos. Videos on the site include clips republished from other celebrity news sites and television shows, as well as exclusive Toofab interviews with celebrities.</p>\n<p>Articles focus on celebrity feuds, relationships, fashion, and news about television and music. Many articles are based on celebrities’ appearances on late night and reality shows or interviews with other publications, and typically link to these outside sources. They often include embedded photos and social media posts.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of the website, Toofab links to other stories from pop culture outlets including Elite Daily, TMZ, and Just Jared.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Unlike many gossip sites, Toofab.com often writes stories summarizing celebrities’ television and magazine interviews, rather than presenting rumor or speculation as news. Headlines are generally straightforward and reflect the content of articles. Outside sources, as well as stock images and social media screenshots, are credited. </p>\n<p>The site does not contain a corrections policy, and NewsGuard could not find any examples of corrected stories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Advertisements are distinguished from news content. The site provides no information about managers or content creators. Articles say they are written only by “TooFab Staff.” </p>\n<p>NewsGuard could not find a method to reach the site directly, but sent two messages to its related site, TMZ, asking how to get in touch with TooFab and inquiring about the site’s approach to corrections and its lack of disclosure about its managers and content creators. None of the messages was answered. An email sent to Shyam Dodge, whose Twitter account describes him as “Managing Editor at TMZ’s TooFab” was also not returned. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site went live in 2010, according to the Wayback Machine archives.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nRachel Treisman\n\nEdited by:\nJoyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://trademarks.justia.com/851/26/toofab-com-85126473.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://trademarks.justia.com/851/26/toofab-com-85126473.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/06/15/time-warner-will-be-renamed-warner-media-turner-ceo-exits/\" target=\"_blank\">https://nypost.com/2018/06/15/time-warner-will-be-renamed-warner-media-turner-ceo-exits/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/att-time-warner-deal-complete/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cbr.com/att-time-warner-deal-complete/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=24689\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=24689</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2018/b281594.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2018/b281594.html </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tmz.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tmz.com </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/business/media/publishers-rethink-outbrain-taboola-ads.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/business/media/publishers-rethink-outbrain-taboola-ads.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/toofab.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.whois.com/whois/toofab.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://toofab.com/videos/\" target=\"_blank\">http://toofab.com/videos/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/tmz/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/tmz/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://muckrack.com/shyam-dodge\" target=\"_blank\">https://muckrack.com/shyam-dodge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100601000000*/toofab.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.archive.org/web/20100601000000*/toofab.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/shyamdodge?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/shyamdodge?lang=en </a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"toofab.com","author":"Rachel Treisman","date":"2018-08-10T02:42:29.501+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/toofab.com/"}}
