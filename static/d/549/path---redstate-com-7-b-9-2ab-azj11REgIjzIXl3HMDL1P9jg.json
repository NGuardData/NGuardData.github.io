Articles typically package RedState writers’ commentary around posts from Twitter or excerpts from other news organizations’ stories. The site’s commentary is consistently conservative, voicing support for the Trump administration and for conservative causes and criticizing liberals and Democrats.  </p>\n<p>Some articles are labeled “diaries,” posted by readers and contributors. The site also publishes podcasts, including “The Right Side,” which discusses conservative ideas and policies. Red State links to content from other Salem-owned sites, including Hot Air, Twitchy, and Townhall.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>RedState.com’s articles are generally based on other news sources, including The New York Times, The Associated Press, The Hill, The Daily Caller, and Britain’s The Daily Mail. Articles are also based on — and quote from — posts from named and unnamed users on social media.</p>\n<p>Red State allows users to contribute posts, called “diaries,” that are published both on the homepage and in a separate section. Contributors register before they can post, and their stories are archived on the site. Some of the diarists are identified by name, but many write under pseudonyms, including “davenj1,” “Pope Sparkles,” and “bk.” A user who identifies himself as a senior contributing editor at RedState goes by “streiff.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, the site has misstated or distorted facts. For example, a November 2018 article, “There’s Good Reason to Believe The Viral Photo Of Border Agents Gassing A Migrant Mother And Her Children Is Staged,” suggests that a widely shared Reuters photograph of a mother running with her half-clothed twin daughters at the Mexico-California border was altered and false. “As you can see, the picture features a lot of people standing around doing nothing while those who do look as if they’re in mortal danger are doing so in front of cameras,” the author wrote. “It sure does make it seem as if there’s more acting going on than panic.”</p>\n<p>Both the photographer and the mother who was photographed were interviewed by several news organizations and confirmed that the image accurately captured the events at the border. The claim that the photograph was staged was also debunked by fact-checking organizations PolitiFact and Snopes, after The Gateway Pundit posted a story calling the photograph a hoax.</p>\n<p>Because RedState does not disclose whether it knows the identities of its anonymous diarists, or if the content is vetted before it is posted, and because RedState has misstated facts in news stories, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not gather and present information responsibly.</p>\n<p>RedState.com does not disclose on the site that it has a conservative orientation and that it publishes opinionated content. The site has no About Us page explaining a mission, and its stories are not labeled as opinion.</p>\n<p>Yet much of RedState.com’s content offers conservative opinion. Opinionated content published in October and November 2018 included articles that ran under the headlines, “A Brief History Of The Left’s Attempts To (Over-)Regulate The Internet;” “Saints Preserve Us! Hillary Clinton Is Still Thinking About Running;” and “Mocking Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Is Not Only Fun But It Is The Right Thing To Do.”</p>\n<p>Because RedState does not distinguish between news and opinion stories and runs opinionated content that advances its point of view, NewsGuard has determined that it does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. </p>\n<p>The site frequently uses headlines, such as the one relating to the photograph, that exaggerate or misstate facts. A November 2018 story, headlined “Federal Judge Says Pro-Lifers Are Like The Klan and Men Should Have No Voice On Abortion,” quotes from a Mississippi judge’s ruling overturning a state law that banned abortions after 15 weeks. However, the opinion did not mention the Ku Klux Klan. The judge wrote that “Legislation like H.B. 1510 is closer to the old Mississippi -- the Mississippi bent on controlling women and minorities.\" </p>\n<p>The site runs corrections, often in the form of a note at the bottom of the article explaining what was changed. For example, in February 2018, the site issued a correction, and the author apologized, after writing a story that falsely accused Parkland, Florida, high school student David Hogg of not being present at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on the day of the mass shooting that killed 17 people. The site and parent company did not respond to two emails and an inquiry sent through a contact form seeking comment on the vetting process for the site’s “diaries” and its handling of the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Stories are credited to authors, and some authors’ biographies and contact information are listed at the end of articles. However, several contributors use pseudonyms. RedState.com does not provide information about its managers or editors. </p>\n<p>The site posts a TownHall Media logo next to the RedState logo at the bottom of the site, but does not disclose the site’s ownership by Salem Media in a user-friendly way.</p>\n<p>Traditional advertising and sponsored content are distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<p>The site and parent company did not respond to two emails and an inquiry sent through a contact form seeking comment on the lack of disclosure of the site’s ownership, leadership, and content creators.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>RedState was founded in 2004, was purchased by Eagle Publishing Inc. in 2006, and acquired by Salem Media in 2014. The site was founded by conservative commentators Josh Trevino, Mike Krempasky, and Ben Domenech. Domenech is also a co-founder of The Federalist, another conservative website. Conservative pundit Erick Erickson served as the site’s editor in chief until 2015.</p>\n<p>Contributing writers have included former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, who wrote one of the site’s earlier diaries. Then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry announced his presidential candidacy in 2011 at RedState’s annual gathering in Charleston, South Carolina. A group of the site’s contributors endorsed him for the presidency later that year.</p>\n<p>RedState.com's position on U.S. President Donald Trump has been a source of debate. In 2015, the site’s then-editor, Erickson, disinvited Donald Trump, then a presidential candidate, from its annual gathering after Trump made disparaging remarks about then-Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly. Then, in April 2018, Salem Media dismissed its then-editor, Caleb Howe, and several writers, saying in an internal memo that the job cuts were “painful” but “necessary” for business reasons. Erickson and some RedState writers publicly said that they believed that the staff members who were were dismissed were targeted because they were critics of Trump.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label incorrectly stated that RedState endorsed Rick Perry for president in 2011. In fact, the endorsement came from a group of RedState contributors, not from the site itself.</em></p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: After further review, NewsGuard has determined that the site meets the standard for publishing corrections and labeling advertising.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJulia Press\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric
