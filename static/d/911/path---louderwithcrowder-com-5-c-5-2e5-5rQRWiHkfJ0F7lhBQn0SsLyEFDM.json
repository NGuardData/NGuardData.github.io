In 2013, he served as an emcee at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual gathering of influential conservatives, and for several years appeared as a contributing commentator on Fox News. A May 2016 article by Louderthancrowder.com writer “Brodigan” claims the site is “entirely independent” and has “no corporate backers.”  </p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored content appear on the site.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Crowder’s site includes news stories and clips from his YouTube channel. Most of the articles include memes, videos, and embedded tweets, and include the writer’s conservative opinion.</p>\n<p>For example, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is referred to as “Madam Fatsuit,” and a story about Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris says “‘Fear Mongering’” is her branded fragrance. Several stories accuse the film industry of “pushing the homosexual agenda.”</p>\n<p>News stories are based on reporting by conservative news sites, such as the Daily Caller and the Daily Signal, as well as clips from cable news networks and social media posts. Original content includes interviews and segments from Crowder’s show, as well as writers’ columns. The site divides its columns into topics including Culture, Political, Islam, International, Feminism, and Healthcare.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Crowder’s site has distorted facts and speeches in ways that support conservative views. For example, a March 2018 story said Emma Gonzalez, a survivor of the Parkland, Florida high school shooting, admitted to bullying the alleged shooter. CNN’s full transcript of the speech cited by Louderwithcrowder.com doesn’t contain such an admission, only Gonzalez’ explanation that Parkland students had alerted school officials about the suspect’s problematic behavior before the February shooting.</p>\n<p>An October 2017 story about a transgender woman being charged with sexual assault of a 10-year-old girl in Wyoming tied the crime to “bathroom laws” allowing transgender people to use public bathrooms that match their gender identity. The assault was alleged to have occurred in a bathroom in a private home, which is not covered by these laws. The Louderwithcrowder.com story was later updated stating where the assault actually took place. The update was not listed as a correction. No corrections policy appears on the site.</p>\n<p>Opinion is also inserted into sensationalized headlines, such as “WATCH: Trey Gowdy Just DISEMBOWELD (sic) FBI Agent Peter Strzok,” referring to a congressional hearing where Gowdy questioned Strzok about ongoing probes of U.S. elections.</p>\n<p>Transgender individuals are common targets of articles. A July 2018 story criticizing the decision to place a transgender inmate in a British women’s prison, where she has been accused of sexually assaulting four inmates, includes the site’s view on gender identity — “Women don’t have penises or erections. Men do,” the story states. A June 2018 article about a transgender man named Sabastion and his son Jaxen referred to the father as “DadMom,” saying Jaxen’s life would be “unnatural” because of his parents.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Crowder repeatedly refers to himself as a conservative in his videos, and his site’s content matches those views. Columns are sometimes marked as opinion pieces, but are also shared on the site’s main news page.</p>\n<p>News articles are credited to authors, but there is no biographical or contact information for individual writers, except for Crowder’s social media information. There is a general contact form on the site.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard sent five emails attempting to contact Crowder — three through his site’s contact form and two through agencies that book Crowder for personal appearances — asking for comment on its corrections policy, disclosure of writers and editors, and the use of opinion and derogatory terms in stories and headlines.<br></p>\n<p>CRTV’s Customer Service team responded to one of the inquiries and said the team does not run the site, and directed inquiries to Crowder’s Twitter and Facebook accounts. NewsGuard was unable to reach Crowder on those platforms.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site’s domain name was registered in 2012, according to Whois.net. The earliest stories found on the site via the Internet Archive date to 2014.</p>\n<p><em>Corrections: An earlier version of this label misstated the full name of an annual conservative gathering called the Conservative Political Action Conference. An earlier version of this label, in a description of a story on the website, also misidentified the U.S. state where a transgender woman was accused of assaulting a 10-year-old girl. The correct state is Wyoming.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJohn Gregory\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Amy
