In addition to PghTrib.com, which offers solely Pittsburgh-Tribune Review content, the company owns the Pittsburgh Pennysaver and community papers and websites in three key southwestern Pennsylvania markets.  </p>\n<p>Trib Total Media’s revenue comes from online advertising, direct mail and promotions. The organization transitioned from print to a digital-only format in December 2016.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>News is heavily local, with a single section labeled U.S./World far below regional news and suburban stories. A banner below the TribLive logo called “The Buzz” does display trending U.S. news stories. Sports, lifestyle, arts and entertainment and other features are similarly local, when appropriate. Video coverage supplements text and photos. Opinion pieces are split between staff and curated editorials (“featured commentary). The site runs syndicated editorial cartoons.</p>\n<p>An online Reader’s Choice section features winners of “best business” awards as voted on by readers of the website’s daily and weekly publications, in nearly 100 categories determined by site leaders.</p>\n<p>The site also incorporates the online versions of two suburban Pittsburgh daily papers: the Tribune-Review of Greensburg and the Valley News Dispatch of Tarentum.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Headlines reflect stories’ content. Opinion pieces are clearly marked and are consistently conservative (“Where is Congress on Illegal Immigration?”). The website provides an email for requesting corrections, which run as editor’s notes with the individual stories rather than on a separate page.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The website indicates Trib Total Media ownership, with an extensive history of the company. Advertising is clearly delineated. A Contact Us page includes a masthead with editors for each edition and their email addresses, though biographical information is not provided. There is a dedicated email address for letters to the editor, which are published on a separate page. The site does not explicitly state its conservative political leanings.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Trib Total Media precursor Tribune-Review Publishing Company was owned by Richard Scaife, an heir to the Mellon banking, oil and aluminum fortune, from 1970 until his 2014 death. Scaife was a major underwriter of conservative organizations, including American Spectator magazine’s Arkansas Project to find evidence of financial and personal transgressions by the Clintons. Under Scaife, the newspaper was accused in the 1990s of publishing questionable stories about the Clintons, including airing the debunked conspiracy theory that deputy Clinton White House counsel Vince Foster, who committed suicide in 1993, was killed. </p>\n<p>The organization today is much more focused on local news. However, the newspaper and site have retained Scaife’s conservative editorial stance, compared with the more centrist Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nPam Weber-Leaf\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://tribtotalmedia.com/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">http://tribtotalmedia.com/about-us/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/09/pittsburgh_trib_digital_only.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/09/pittsburgh<em>trib</em>digital_only.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mapquest.com/us/pennsylvania/valley-news-dispatch-1897052\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mapquest.com/us/pennsylvania/valley-news-dispatch-1897052</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://triblive.com/news/fayette/6617393-74/club-golf-clubs\" target=\"_blank\">http://triblive.com/news/fayette/6617393-74/club-golf-clubs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pittsburgh-tribune-review/\" target=\"_blank\">https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pittsburgh-tribune-review/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/tangled_web/1997/01/the_conspiracy_commerce_department.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/tangled<em>web/1997/01/the</em>conspiracy<em>commerce</em>department.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/so-happy-together-96855\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newsweek.com/so-happy-together-96855</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2004/07/26/cable-news-networks-obsess-over-teresa-heinz-ke/131509\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2004/07/26/cable-news-networks-obsess-over-teresa-heinz-ke/131509</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"triblive.com","author":"Pam Weber-Leaf","date":"2018-08-17T21:01:05.696+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/triblive.com/"}}
