Butler, who remains the site’s CEO and editor-in-chief. Mongabay is a nonprofit organization that raised nearly $3.3 million in contributions and grants in 2016, according to its tax filings. Its major funders have included the MacArthur Foundation and the Ford Foundation.</p>\n<p>The site solicits donations and runs advertising. Butler said he named the site loosely after Nosy Mangabe, a Madagascan island.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Mongabay.com’s tagline is “News &#x26; inspiration from nature’s front line.” The site offers original reporting on environmental and conservation issues in the Southern Hemisphere, focusing on deforestation, wildlife protection, indigenous land rights, and ocean conditions in countries including Indonesia, Madagascar, Honduras, and Rwanda. Articles are grouped by topics, including Rainforests, Oceans, and Animals &#x26; Environment. The site also offers a For Kids section with reading and lesson plans on conservation.</p>\n<p>Mongabay content is available in nine languages -- English, Chinese, German, Spanish, French, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, and Portuguese. Typical articles include “Haiti may lose all primary forest by 2035, mass extinction underway;” “Peru shares its fisheries surveillance data with the world;” and “Google searches reveal public interest in conservation is rising.”</p>\n<p>Mongabay often teams up with other groups on special projects, such as a 2017 series “Indonesia for Sale,” produced with the London-based nonprofit Earthsight.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Reporting is generally well-sourced and factual, often citing peer-reviewed journals, scientists, and environmentalists. Headlines accurately reflect content. On its FAQ page, the site invites readers to point out errors, and it runs corrections, often in the form of editor’s notes at the bottom of articles.</p>\n<p>Mongabay.com is clear about its environmentalist orientation, saying its mission is “to raise awareness about social and environmental issues relating to forests and other ecosystems.” Because the site does not typically misstate or distort facts to advance its agenda, NewsGuard has determined that it handles the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Mongabay.com stories are credited to authors, and the site provides biographies and contact information for its editors and content creators. It also posts a detailed description of its history, mission, and nonprofit structure. A dedicated Funders page lists the organizations that have contributed to Mongabay since 2012, when it became a nonprofit.</p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Butler founded Mongabay.com in 1999. In 2015, a newly discovered beetle species was named after Butler, in a tribute to his work raising rainforest awareness.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJon Allsop\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120036638439890355?ns=prod/accounts-wsj\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120036638439890355?ns=prod/accounts-wsj</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mongabay.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mongabay.com/about/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mongabay.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://mongabay.org/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2013/10/shifting-to-a-non-profit-model-for-environmental-news-reporting/\" target=\"_blank\">https://news.mongabay.com/2013/10/shifting-to-a-non-profit-model-for-environmental-news-reporting/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macfound.org/grantees/2463/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.macfound.org/grantees/2463/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/en/blog/00-18473-mongabay-latin-america-celebrates-one-year-more-500-reports-published-environmental-is\" target=\"_blank\">https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/en/blog/00-18473-mongabay-latin-america-celebrates-one-year-more-500-reports-published-environmental-is</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2016/453/714/2016-453714703-0e774297-9.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2016/453/714/2016-453714703-0e774297-9.pdf</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://education.mongabay.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://education.mongabay.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/en/blog/00-18473-mongabay-latin-america-celebrates-one-year-more-500-reports-published-environmental-is\" target=\"_blank\">https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/en/blog/00-18473-mongabay-latin-america-celebrates-one-year-more-500-reports-published-environmental-is</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/11/this-reporting-project-wants-to-get-environmental-investigations-out-of-pdfs-and-white-papers-and-to-the-people-affected/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/11/this-reporting-project-wants-to-get-environmental-investigations-out-of-pdfs-and-white-papers-and-to-the-people-affected/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mongabay.com/faq/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mongabay.com/faq/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2017/11/much-deeper-than-we-expected-huge-peatland-offers-up-more-surprises/\" target=\"_blank\">https://news.mongabay.com/2017/11/much-deeper-than-we-expected-huge-peatland-offers-up-more-surprises/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mongabay.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mongabay.com/about/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/10/british-owned-cruise-ship-wrecks-one-of-indonesias-best-coral-reefs\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/10/british-owned-cruise-ship-wrecks-one-of-indonesias-best-coral-reefs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/guardian-environment-network+world/indonesia\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/guardian-environment-network+world/indonesia</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1730759_1731034_1731045,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1730759<em>1731034</em>1731045,00.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mongabay.org/about/team/\" target=\"_blank\">https://mongabay.org/about/team/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mongabay.com/funders/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mongabay.com/funders/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mongabay.com/rhett/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mongabay.com/rhett/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2015/01/things-you-want-to-know-about-mongabay/\" target=\"_blank\">https://news.mongabay.com/2015/01/things-you-want-to-know-about-mongabay/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2015/04/your-name-here-auctioning-the-naming-rights-to-new-species-to-fund-conservation/\" target=\"_blank\">https://news.mongabay.com/2015/04/your-name-here-auctioning-the-naming-rights-to-new-species-to-fund-conservation/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"mongabay.com","author":"Jon Allsop","date":"2018-11-20T14:38:55.772+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/mongabay.com/"}}
