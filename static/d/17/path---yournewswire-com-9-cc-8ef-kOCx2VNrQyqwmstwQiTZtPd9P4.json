The People’s Voice is operated by Sean Adl-Tabatabai, a former MTV producer, who is the founder and editor in chief of YourNewsWire and NewsPunch. According to a September 2017 profile of Adl-Tabatabai in the Hollywood Reporter, Google AdSense, which places ads on websites, dropped YourNewsWire for violating unspecified policies.</p>\n<p>The site runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>NewsPunch, bearing the tagline “Where Mainstream Fears To Tread,” divides its articles into five categories: News, Health, Sci/Environment, Technology, and Entertainment. Articles cover international politics and news, based on reporting from a variety of news organizations. One July 2018 article, “Trump: New Evidence Proves Bush &#x26; Clintons Orchestrated 9/11,” cited the conspiracy site Infowars as its source, while another, “California Declared Largest Insane Asylum In The World,” drew on reporting from the Los Angeles Times. Health articles promote alternative medicine treatments and make claims about the dangerous effects of vaccines and various drugs.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>NewsPunch regularly publishes articles that contain false information or promote conspiracy theories. The site has published dozens of stories, for example, promoting the debunked “Pizzagate” theory, which accused Hillary Clinton and others of running child-sex rings at restaurants in Washington. YourNewsWire published some of these stories with a “News” tag, rather than its “Conspiracies” tag. The site has also published articles that falsely claim the U.S. government orchestrated the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, that the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre was a hoax, and that Pope Francis has been charged with rape and murder.</p>\n<p>The site has also promoted unfounded conspiracy theories in its Health section. A March 2018 article claims that a “holistic” doctor named Jeff Bradstreet, who reportedly discovered enzymes causing cancer, autism and diabetes in vaccines, “may have been killed” in an attempt to keep his findings from going public. NewsPunch’s source for this claim was Awarenessact.com, a site that NewsGuard found has repeatedly published stories on debunked health and medicine conspiracy theories. The Rutherford County, North Carolina, Sheriff’s Office ruled Bradstreet’s 2015 death a suicide, according to a 2017 article from PolitiFact that debunked the claim.</p>\n<p>A June 2018 article says the American Cancer Society released a list of five foods, such as blueberries and green tea, that are “that are proven to halt the growth and spread of cancer.” American Cancer society spokeswoman Kathi Di Nicola told NewsGuard the organization did not release the list cited in the article and the health claims “are inaccurate as framed in the story.”</p>\n<p>Articles often start with a kernel of real news, which is then twisted to reach unsubstantiated conclusions. For example, in a July 2018 article headlined “Gallup Poll: Democrats Overwhelmingly Hate America,” Adl-Tabatabai, the editor in chief, cites a poll showing the decline among Democrats who feel “extremely proud” to be American. The poll reflected Democrats’ unhappiness with Donald Trump, and Gallup never suggested that Democrats “hate America.” But Adl-Tabatabai wrote, “This is quite fortunate as it allows those of us in the right and on the right to claim patriotism for ourselves.” </p>\n<p>Headlines are misleading. For example, a June 2018 article titled “Trump: Judge Jeanine Pirro Will Be Next Supreme Court Justice” cited as its primary source a tweet from Donald Trump Jr. stating, “This would be pretty awesome,” referencing another tweet of Pirro’s photo and the caption, “Introducing Supreme Court Justice Jeanine Pirro.” The headline falsely implied that President Trump, not his son, supported Pirro’s ascent to the nation’s highest court.</p>\n<p>NewsPunch has also published misleading photographs. For example, a February 2018 article titled “Mainstream Media Cover-Up Woody Allen’s Pedophilia Ahead of Oscars” features a photograph of Allen with his daughter, Bechet. While Allen’s daughter, Dylan Farrow, has accused the director of molesting her, no allegations have been made against Allen involving his daughter, Bechet. The picture is not captioned.</p>\n<p>NewsPunch does not have a corrections policy and does not publish corrections. In some cases, the site has removed factually incorrect articles from its website, but did not issue a correction or update acknowledging the error. For example, the site deleted a heavily criticized May 2016 article titled “Queen Elizabeth Reveals She Is Ready To Flee Britain,” which stated that “the Queen was overheard saying that military intelligence suggests that if Britain doesn’t leave Europe then World War 3 will occur.”</p>\n<p>NewsPunch,</p>\n<p>The site was declared a “fake news” site by several fact-checking sites and news organizations, including PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, Snopes, CBS News, and The Times of London.</p>\n<p>Because NewsPunch has regularly published false stories and conspiracy theories to advance largely conservative opinions, NewsGuard has determined that it does not gather and present information responsibly, or handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>The People’s Voice did not respond to two emails seeking comment on the site’s track record of publishing false conspiracies, its lack of corrections, its misleading headlines, and its distortion of facts to advance opinions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles list the name of the writer, but do not link to biographical or contact information or disclose top editors. The site’s Contact Us page lists a Los Angeles address, general email address and phone number. The bottom of the site makes clear that it is owned by The People’s Voice. Advertisements are clearly distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Founder and editor in chief Sean Adl-Tabatabai started YourNewsWire.com in 2014. He worked previously as a TV producer in the United Kingdom and as a webmaster for British conspiracy theorist David Icke. Icke stated in a May 2016 interview with the BBC that he believes 9/11 was a “conspiracy,” that the British Royal Family are “shape-shifting lizards.”</p>\n<p>Adl-Tabatabai described himself as a “liberal” to the Evening Standard newspaper, but the Standard noted that he also “claims kinship” with InfoWars’ Alex Jones. According to the Hollywood Reporter, YourNewsWire often relies on Russia Today (RT.com) as a “favored source,” but Adl-Tabatabai denies “any links to the Kremlin.”</p>\n<p>In November 2018, yournewswire.com began redirecting its content to newspunch.com.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling\n\nEdited by:\nJohn Gregory&#x26;emsp;Amy
