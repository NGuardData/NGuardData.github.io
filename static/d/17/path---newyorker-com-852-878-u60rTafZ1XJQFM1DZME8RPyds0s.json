Condé Nast’s publications include Vogue, GQ, and Vanity Fair. The New Yorker also hosts an annual three-day literary festival in New York City.</p>\n<p>The site runs advertisements and operates a paywall requiring visitors to subscribe to a New Yorker membership after reading a limited number of free monthly articles. The site also generates revenue by selling New Yorker magazine covers and merchandise on the Condé Nast online store.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site’s News &#x26; Politics page publishes original reporting and interviews, in-depth features and analysis, and opinion pieces by New Yorker writers and columnists. These stories are often focused on U.S. politics and social issues, but include substantial reports on international news and events. Rather than focusing on breaking news, the New Yorker has been historically known for its Pulitzer Prize-winning longform pieces, from a story on an impending major earthquake on the U.S. northwest coast to an influential report giving voice to the thirteen women who initially accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault and harassment.</p>\n<p>Other notable articles include a detailed profile of Angela Merkel in 2014, the German chancellor; a 2015 piece about a former member of the Westboro Baptist Church, which is known for its anti-gay activism; and a 2016 article about Donald Trump’s book, “The Art of the Deal,” and the many regrets of Tony Schwartz, Trump’s ghostwriter. In recent years, the website has produced an increasing amount of news and commentary related to daily political events, particularly about the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>The Business &#x26; Tech section features originally reported articles and commentaries on the tech industry, scientific discoveries and the environment, healthcare, and international business. The site also publishes reviews of films and theater, music, restaurants, books, and TV shows, along short humor pieces named “Daily Shouts,” and its celebrated cartoons.</p>\n<p>The site’s Talk Of The Town section features mostly whimsical, occasionally serious depictions of everyday life and sometimes offbeat events in New York City. The Goings On About Town guide publishes schedules and reviews of cultural events around the city, available in list and map form. The site also has separate sections for its videos and podcasts, which feature a mix of news, interviews, commentary, fiction and poetry, and humor. </p>\n<p>The New Yorker Archives platform, available only to subscribers, features every New Yorker article and copy of the magazine dating to its first print issue nearly a century ago.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The New Yorker has a history of rigorous fact checking, employing nearly two dozen fact checkers for its print and online content. Articles rely largely on first-hand interviews and original reporting. Headlines accurately reflect the content of articles, and links to sources are provided.</p>\n<p>A longtime literary magazine, the New Yorker has in recent years become increasingly political, endorsing a U.S. presidential candidate in 2004 for the first time in its history -- Democrat John Kerry over Republican President George W. Bush. David Remnick, the New Yorker’s editor, has written numerous articles criticizing President Trump and his administration, and much of the content published on the site approaches political and social issues from a liberal point of view.</p>\n<p>The New Yorker has won four Pulitzer Prizes, most recently in 2018 for Public Service (together with the New York Times) for Ronan Farrow’s reporting on accusations against Harvey Weinstein and their fallout.</p>\n<p>Newyorker.com regularly publishes corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Newyorker.com provides information about its content, newsletters, and social media pages on its About Us page. The Contact Us page lists general email addresses for sending letters to the editor or submissions. The Contributors page publishes a full list of New Yorker editors, other staff, and contributors, including biographical information and, occasionally, a Twitter handle. The site makes clear its relationship to Condé Nast at the bottom of every page. The sources for Images and videos are listed.</p>\n<p>The site clearly labels advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The New Yorker was founded in 1925 by American journalists Harold Ross and Jane Grant as a literary and culture humor magazine. It would go on to publish short stories by many of the greatest writers of the 20th and 21st centuries, including Vladimir Nabokov, J.D. Salinger, and Philip Roth. It also established a singular commitment to long-form nonfiction reporting and investigative reporting, notably devoting an entire issue to “Hiroshima,” John Hershey’s gripping narrative of the bombing of Hiroshima and its after effects. In 1962, The New Yorker published Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring” in three parts, which would go on to become an influential book that gave rise to the environmentalist movement. Since its founding, the New Yorker has been widely recognized for its magazine covers, cartoons, and its iconic mascot Eustace Tilley.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling\n\nEdited by:\nJoyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://festival.newyorker.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://festival.newyorker.com/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/archive&nbsp;/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newyorker.com/archive /</a> <a href=\"https://archives.newyorker.com/\">https://archives.newyorker.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/01/quiet-german\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/01/quiet-german</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/conversion-via-twitter-westboro-baptist-church-megan-phelps-roper\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/conversion-via-twitter-westboro-baptist-church-megan-phelps-roper</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/new-york-times-reporting-led-jodi-kantor-and-megan-twohey-and-new-yorker-reporting-ronan\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/new-york-times-reporting-led-jodi-kantor-and-megan-twohey-and-new-yorker-reporting-ronan</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/daily-life-new-yorker-fact-checker/\" target=\"_blank\">https://inews.co.uk/opinion/daily-life-new-yorker-fact-checker/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-art-of-fact-checking\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-art-of-fact-checking</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/11/01/the-choice-5\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/11/01/the-choice-5</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/about/us\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newyorker.com/about/us</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/contributors\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newyorker.com/contributors</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/06/the-new-yorker-staff-wants-to-unionize.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/06/the-new-yorker-staff-wants-to-unionize.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1946/08/31/hiroshima\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1946/08/31/hiroshima</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/mystery-man-2\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/mystery-man-2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/magazine/how-silent-spring-ignited-the-environmental-movement.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/magazine/how-silent-spring-ignited-the-environmental-movement.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1962/06/16/silent-spring-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1962/06/16/silent-spring-part-1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/may/27/rachel-carson-silent-spring-anniversary\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/may/27/rachel-carson-silent-spring-anniversary</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"newyorker.com","author":"Anna-Sophie Harling","date":"2018-08-16T17:13:47.688+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/newyorker.com/"}}
