Poynter also owns the Tampa Bay Times, which was previously named the St. Petersburg Times. In 2018, Poynter took control of PolitiFact from the Tampa Bay Times, a move that made donations to PolitiFact tax deductible due to Poynter’s nonprofit status. In 2017, PolitiFact launched a “Truth Squad” membership program. The program offers perks such as stickers and access to a closed Facebook group to members who donate more than $50 a year. </p>\n<p>PolitiFact is also funded by “online advertising, grants from nonpartisan civil society groups, and by sharing our content with other publishers,” according to its Funding page. The site runs clearly marked branded content, such as a March 2018 story titled “Why Consumers Are Uneasy About IoT Companies,” paid for by technology company CDW. Such content “must be approved by the PolitiFact Approval Committee,” according to PolitiFact’s media kit. </p>\n<p>PolitiFact lists donations of more than $1,000. The site says it does not accept donations from anonymous sources, political parties, elected officials, candidates, “or any other source with a conflict of interest as determined by PolitiFact’s executive director.”</p>\n<p>As of June 30, 2018, PolitiFact said it raised $94,110 through the Truth Squad in 2018, with none of the donations more than $1,000. In 2018, the site also received $250,000 from the Democracy Fund, created by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, and another $5,000 from the Craig Newmark Foundation, which is named after the founder of Craigslist. In 2017, the site received $206,143 from the Truth Squad. The Democracy Fund gave Politifact $125,000 that year, and the Knight Foundation and the Craig Newmark Foundation each gave $50,000. Donors in past years have included the Ford Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>PolitiFact rates claims made by U.S. politicians, political parties and committees, pundits, media outlets, bloggers and occasionally viral posts on social media. PolitiFact says it has evaluated more than 15,000 claims. PolitiFact issues ratings that include “True,” “Mostly True,” “Half True,” “Mostly False,”  and “False.” It reserves “Pants On Fire” for statements that “make a ridiculous claim.”</p>\n<p>For example, in late August 2018, the site gave a “Half True” rating to North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp’s claim that her Republican opponent voted to “let insurance companies go back to denying coverage for 300,000 North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions.” It gave a “Mostly False” rating to President Donald Trump’s claim the U.S. is the “cleanest country in the planet right now” in terms of environmental health. It gave a “Pants on Fire” rating to Rudy Giuliani’s claim that the Trump campaign “didn’t know” that a Russian citizen at a 2016 meeting with Trump aides was, in fact, a Russian.</p>\n<p>The PolitiFact home page includes links to different editions, including national, which features the majority of PolitiFact’s work. Global News covers statements on foreign countries and global affairs primarily made by Americans. It occasionally runs guest columns by former members of Congress from both parties. Former GOP Rep. David Jolly and former Democratic Rep. Jason Altmire have both written for the site.</p>\n<p>The site tracks whether both Presidents Barack Obama and Trump kept campaign promises. And each year, PolitiFact announces a “Lie of the Year.” In 2017, it chose President Trump’s claim that Russian interference in the 2016 election was a “hoax” and a “made-up story.” In 2016, “Lie of the Year” went to “fake news” -- the spread of misinformation related to the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign misstatements were the 2015 “Lie of the Year.” In 2013 the site awarded Lie of the Year to the claim made by President Obama and other Democrats that, under the Affordable Care Act, people could keep their health plan if they liked it.</p>\n<p>PolitiFact has offices in Washington and St. Petersburg, Florida. It also has state-level editions through partnerships. For example, PolitiFact California is a partnership with Capital Public Radio, an NPR affiliate in Sacramento. PolitiFact Texas is a partnership between PolitiFact and the Austin American-Statesman, the Houston Chronicle, and the San Antonio News-Express.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>When PolitiFact was under the St. Petersburg Times’ ownership, the newspaper staff was awarded the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for PolitiFact’s fact-checking of the 2008 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>PolitiFact is a member of the International Fact-Checking Network, a unit of the Poynter Institute that certifies fact-checking organizations. After the 2016 presidential election, Facebook choose PolitiFact as one of five fact-checking sites to partner with in order to identify and debunk misinformation and disinformation on its platform.</p>\n<p>PolitiFact writers seek comment and clarification from those whose claims it evaluates. It conducts interviews with multiple experts to determine the validity of claims. The site publishes sources for its stories, including news reports, government documents, and those  interviewed for the fact check. PolitiFact sometimes publishes the emails it sends and receives while reporting. To arrive at a rating,the reporter and editor who worked initially on the fact-check reach agreement about the rating. Then, that rating is brought to two additional editors. The three editors vote to determine the final rating.  </p>\n<p>PolitiFact has a publicly available corrections policy, which states that “major errors of fact” receive a correction at the top of a fact check. Errors that do not impact the rating or “do not change the general outlook of the fact-check” warrant a correction at the bottom of the fact check. Typographical and grammatical errors are fixed without a notation as soon as the site becomes aware of them.</p>\n<p>PolitiFact also publishes criteria describing how it chooses which claims to fact-check.  According to the site, its writers and researchers read “transcripts, speeches, news stories, press releases and campaign brochures” and “watch TV and scan social media” to find statements to fact-check. The site also says that about one-third of its fact checks are based on suggestions sent from readers, adding that it selects “the most newsworthy and significant ones.” PolitiFact also says that it tries to select claims made by Democratic and Republican politicians, but said it is not “keeping count” to ensure an equal distribution. “We more often fact-check the party that holds power or people who make attention-getting or misleading statements,” PolitiFact said on a page explaining its process.</p>\n<p>Some researchers have tried to statistically analyze PolitiFact’s fact checks to determine if the site is biased against conservatives, who have said PolitiFact’s work shows liberal bias, particularly with ratings of “Half True” and “Mostly True,” rather than outright true and false ratings.</p>\n<p>For example, in 2018, Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz called PolitiFact a “liberal parody site” on Twitter after the site gave him a “False” rating for claiming his opponent, Democrat Beto O’Rourke, wanted to legalize all narcotics. Cruz claimed that the site had given a previous O’Rourke opponent a “Half True” rating for making the same claim back in 2012. But O’Rourke’s previous opponent, Sylvester Reyes, said that O’Rourke wanted to “legalize all drugs,” not narcotics, so PolitiFact found Reyes’ claim to be “Half True.” O’Rourke has called for the legalization of marijuana, which is a drug but not a narcotic.</p>\n<p>A 2018 study by researchers from the University of Washington and Carnegie Mellon University used text analysis techniques to determine if PolitiFact used different language to describe the two parties and their members. The researchers wrote that they were “not able to detect any systematic differences in the treatment of Democrats and Republicans in articles by PolitiFact.”</p>\n<p>In 2016, researchers from the University of Mary Washington and George Mason University  evaluated fact checks by PolitiFact and The Washington Post’s Fact Checker between January and June 2013. The researchers found that PolitiFact rated 53 percent of Republican statements it inspected either false or mostly false, compared to 22.7 percent of statements by President Barack Obama, and 30.5 percent of statements made by other Democrats. The Washington Post gave either 3 or 4 “Pinocchios” (the equivalent of PolitiFact’s  False and Mostly False) to 61.9 percent of Republican statements, 17.7 percent of statements by Obama, and 57.1 percent of statements made by other Democrats.</p>\n<p>Both fact-checking operations gave more “false” ratings to Republicans than Democrats, and both targeted Republican claims more than Democratic ones. The study’s authors stated that those results could reflect biases of the fact checkers, or could indicate that Republicans are “more likely to deceive the public than their Democratic counterparts.” </p>\n<p>PolitiFact editor Angie Holan told NewsGuard in a telephone interview that the Truth-o-Meter “is not an actual scientific instrument. It’s just a fun ratings system we developed to try and give people a sense of where we’re coming from. I think people enjoy arguing the ratings to some extent.</p>\n<p>“There’s no quantitative difference between the ratings, especially the center ratings: ‘Half True,’ ‘Mostly True,’ ‘Mostly False,’”  she added, essentially denying a distinction that those who get either of the ratings take seriously.</p>\n<p>Holan also explained that she personally tries to avoid “Half True” ratings after researchers told her they confuse readers. “Just speaking for myself as someone who votes on the ratings, if I see a justification to tip it one way or another to ‘Mostly False’ or ‘Mostly True,’ I do for reader clarity,” Holan said. </p>\n<p>The site has sometimes issued the qualifying ratings in such a way that it reached different conclusions on similar claims. In 2012, the site gave a “Half True” rating to GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul’s claim the federal income tax rate was zero percent until 1913. But in 2015, the site gave a “Mostly True” rating to Democratic presidential candidate Jim Webb’s claim that the U.S. did not have a federal income tax until 1913. More than a year later, in December 2016, PolitiFact issued a correction on the Webb fact check, and changed its rating to “Half True,” the same rating it gave to Paul’s statement. Holan told NewsGuard that different staff members worked on the two ratings, and the change was made after readers pointed out the inconsistency. </p>\n<p>“We do have a process where we look at how we rate previous items on the same statement, and we try to rate them the same,” Holan said. “But for some reason this one got through.”</p>\n<p>NewsGuard reviewed a sampling of seven conservative critiques of PolitiFact fact checks from sources including PolitifactBias.com, a blog devoted to criticizing PolitiFact, and the conservative Media Research Center. It found that two of the criticisms of the fact checks had merit, and did not result in corrections from PolitiFact.</p>\n<p>In July 2018, PolitiFact gave a “Mostly True” rating to Democratic Senator Kamala Harris’s assertion that a full-time worker earning minimum wage cannot afford a one-bedroom apartment in “99 percent of counties in America.” PolitiFact contacted Harris’s press secretary, who said that Harris was referencing a study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which found that “in only 22 counties out of more than 3,000 counties nationwide can a full-time minimum wage worker afford a one-bedroom rental home at fair market rent.”</p>\n<p>But as PolitiFact acknowledged, “fair market rent” is defined as “the 40th percentile of gross rents for standard rental units,” meaning the study did not find that minimum-wage workers could not afford an apartment in 99 percent of counties in America, as Harris claimed. Despite the difference between what the study and Harris said, her claim was rated “Mostly True.”</p>\n<p>Asked about the rating, Holan told NewsGuard, “We felt like it was mostly true because she said they can’t afford it and the study was on affordability… It seemed like her general point was a good one, that minimum wage people are struggling to rent fair market rate apartments and it did apply to the counties she mentioned.” </p>\n<p>Also in July 2018, PolitiFact fact-checked a statement made by President Trump about European auto imports. Trump’s full quote, from a June speech at a Wisconsin electronics plant, was: “European Union, last year, trade imbalance. We had a deficit of $151 billion. They send us Mercedes, they send us — by the millions — the BMWs — cars by the millions.”</p>\n<p>Although the staccato nature of Trump’s quote makes it difficult to determine exactly what his point was, a critic at PolitiFactBias.com argued “by the millions” was referring to cars imported from the European Union, and that Trump was citing BMW and Mercedes as examples of European automakers. But instead of fact-checking whether the European Union sent the U.S. “cars by the millions,” PolitiFact fact-checked if Mercedes and BMW sent more than a million cars to the U.S. every year. </p>\n<p>As PolitiFactBias pointed out, the European Union has actually exported more than a million motor vehicles to the U.S. every year since 2014, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Holan told NewsGuard, “It just might be worth us looking at it again.” She added later, “Maybe this one we would’ve been better off avoiding.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>PolitiFact fact checks list an author, an editor and a list of sources, including anyone the reporter interviewed. Author names link to a page with biographical and contact information, including emails and sometimes phone numbers, as well as links to Twitter accounts. A separate page lists editorial staff, along with each employee’s contact and biographical information. The site provides an email address for general inquiries and fact check suggestions, as well as phone numbers and addresses for its Washington and St. Petersburg, Florida, offices.</p>\n<p>PolitiFact discloses information about its funding, fact-checking process, and ethics policy, which states that staff members are barred from making political contributions or working on campaigns. Advertising is clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>PolitiFact was launched in 2007 by the St. Petersburg Times, which later changed its name to the Tampa Bay
