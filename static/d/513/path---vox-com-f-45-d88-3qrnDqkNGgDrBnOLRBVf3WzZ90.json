Its leading investors include NBCUniversal, General Atlantic, Accel, Comcast Ventures, and Khosla Ventures. Vox Media also owns the The Verge, SB Nation, Polygon, Eater, Racked, Curbed, and Recode.</p>\n<p>Revenue comes from advertisements, including branded content. Vox Media also hosts and sells advertising for other sites such as Funny Or Die and Bill Simmons’ The Ringer, and for other publishers in revenue-sharing agreements. The company plans to license Chorus, its publishing platform, to other publishers, which would use the platform to create stories, keep track of readership, and disburse content on social media, according to The Wall Street Journal. Vox Media also has a partnership with Netflix for a series called “Explained,” and partnerships with PBS and CNN for TV shows tied to its other websites. Recode’s tech conference business also brings in revenue.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Vox.com publishes articles and produces videos and podcasts to explain politics and policy, culture, science and health, business and finance, often with visual aids. For example, it used 17 maps and charts as well as video to explain America’s “unique” gun violence problem. Its story on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court used cartoon figures to illustrate how Chief Justice John Roberts would become the court’s “new median” among the court’s right and left-leaning justices. Line graphs tracked the evolution of Supreme Court ideology, as it has changed since 2005 and since 1937. It used animation to show the shift that would have happened had Merrick Garland, President Obama’s thwarted Supreme Court nominee, been confirmed in 2016. </p>\n<p>Video “Explainers” inform on a range of topics, from “Trump Invented a Fake Spy Scandal.  People Will Still Believe It” to the more quirky “Why the U.S. National Anthem Is Terrible--and Perfect” (its lowest and highest notes are an octave and a half apart, which is why few people can sing it) and “How One Typeface Took Over Movie Posters.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles are fact-based, and support their positions with original reporting and credible outside sources. The site has stood out for its health-care coverage. Vox senior policy correspondent Sarah Kliff chronicled and explained the Affordable Care Act, and her story on why ACA enrollees in rural Kentucky voted for Donald Trump drew widespread attention. She has been conducting a year-long project on U.S. health-care prices, and has invited readers to submit their emergency room bills.</p>\n<p>The site’s liberal perspective is evident in such headlines as “The messy reality of Donald Trump’s poll numbers,” “The Trump administration’s new move to undercut affirmative action, explained,” “The Trump administration says it must lock up families to keep them together. That’s Not True.” However, Vox also runs stories that run counter to the positions it might be expected to take, such as “Why Trump May Not Be to Blame for Immigrants Being Booted From the Military.” An Associated Press report that more than 40 U.S. Army reservists and recruits had been promised a path to citizenship when they joined the military but were then “abruptly discharged” roiled social media. Vox found the issue dated from the Obama years, and wasn’t necessarily driven by Trump’s anti-immigrant policies.</p>\n<p>From January through mid-July 2018, the site ran many corrections, some of them substantive. A July 2018 “Today, Explained” podcast incorrectly stated that the majority of white millennials voted for Donald Trump. While Trump won the youngest white demographic (ages 18-29), he won a plurality (47 percent), not a majority, as Vox noted in its correction. An April 19, 2018, story incorrectly stated that the New York attorney general could indict former Trump attorney Michael Cohen regardless of whether Cohen was convicted of breaking federal laws that closely resemble New York state laws, and regardless of whether Trump pardoned him. It updated the article with the correct information. </p>\n<p>Corrections generally appear at the bottom of the story with the word “Correction” usually in bold followed by an explanation of the error. Some corrections might add an editor’s note, or a clarification, which comes usually in response to a reader’s comment.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The Vox.com Masthead page lists all editorial staff members with their titles and provides links to longer profiles of reporters, which include their archived Vox stories. Some include short biographies, emails, and Twitter handles.</p>\n<p>Articles are credited to individual reporters. There’s a Contact Us form, where readers can submit story suggestions and questions, and another form exclusively for news tips. There’s also a link to “How We Make Vox,” where editors post about leadership changes, Vox’s growth, and new sections.  </p>\n<p>The About page for Vox Media lists the leadership team (from chairman to chief financial officer with Twitter handles) and the company’s major investors.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are distinguished from articles, and sponsored content is labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The founders of Vox in 2014 were Ezra Klein, a columnist and editor at the Washington Post who was well known in policy circles for his “Wonkblog” column and “Wonkbook” newsletter; Melissa Bell, director of platforms at the Washington Post; and Matthew Yglesias, author of the “Moneybag” column for Slate. The goal was to explain policy, and to make policy interesting. </p>\n<p>In its first years, the site would take a topic such as fracking, or “Everything You Need to Know About Israel-Palestine” or “Everything You Need to Know About Passover,” or the Oscars, and break it down into a series of card stacks that mimicked paper three-by-five-inch index cards. Those provided background on stories, but they were not the “game-changer” Klein believed they would be. “It was an idea of, we could create one big innovation, and that would change the way the whole thing worked,” Klein said on his podcast, “The Ezra Klein Show,” as reported by Digiday in 2016. “I’m still proud of them … but they’re not going to change the whole game.”</p>\n<p>Klein stepped down as editor-in-chief to become editor-at-large. Yglesias is senior correspondent, and Bell became publisher of Vox Media in 2016.</p>\n<p>Vox Media was founded in 2003, and was previously known as Sportsblogs Inc. It became Vox Media Inc. in 2011.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nKarin Halperin\n\nEdited by:\nJim Warren&#x26;emsp;Yemile Bucay&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vox-media/investors/investors_list\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vox-media/investors/investors_list</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/business/media/the-ringer-vox-bill-simmons-medium.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/business/media/the-ringer-vox-bill-simmons-medium.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40575395/voxs-netflix-ambitions-are-just-the-beginning\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.fastcompany.com/40575395/voxs-netflix-ambitions-are-just-the-beginning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/funny-or-die-to-retire-decade-old-website-will-migrate-to-vox-medias-platform-1202719129/\" target=\"_blank\">https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/funny-or-die-to-retire-decade-old-website-will-migrate-to-vox-medias-platform-1202719129/ </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/vox-media-to-begin-licensing-publishing-technology-chorus-1531828800\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/vox-media-to-begin-licensing-publishing-technology-chorus-1531828800</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/9/17548782/brett-kavanaugh-trump-supreme-court-anthony-kennedy\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.vox.com/2018/7/9/17548782/brett-kavanaugh-trump-supreme-court-anthony-kennedy</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/9/17537808/supreme-court-brett-kavanaugh-right-cartoon\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/9/17537808/supreme-court-brett-kavanaugh-right-cartoon </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/46-times-vox-totally-fucked-up-a-story-1673835447\" target=\"_blank\">https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/46-times-vox-totally-fucked-up-a-story-1673835447 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/9/17540114/immigrants-discharged-kicked-military-daca\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.vox.com/2018/7/9/17540114/immigrants-discharged-kicked-military-daca </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/8/17546142/trump-breastfeeding-new-york-times-ecuador&nbsp;example\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.vox.com/2018/7/8/17546142/trump-breastfeeding-new-york-times-ecuador example</a> of correction)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/30/17170716/trump-surreal-nightmare&nbsp;(example\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/30/17170716/trump-surreal-nightmare (example</a> of correction)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/11/17553452/jim-jordan-rosenstein-janet-garrett-democrat&nbsp;(correction)\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.vox.com/2018/7/11/17553452/jim-jordan-rosenstein-janet-garrett-democrat (correction)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/5/17538160/andrew-wheeler-epa-scott-pruitt\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.vox.com/2018/7/5/17538160/andrew-wheeler-epa-scott-pruitt </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/6/5/17373314/electricity-technology-efficiency-software-waste-3dfs&nbsp;(correction,\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/6/5/17373314/electricity-technology-efficiency-software-waste-3dfs (correction,</a> clarification, editor’s note)</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/4/18/17252554/trump-cohen-new-york-state-laws\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.vox.com/2018/4/18/17252554/trump-cohen-new-york-state-laws</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>See the “About” sections of Vox.com and Vox Media</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/two-years-vox-com-reconsiders-card-stacks/\" target=\"_blank\">https://digiday.com/media/two-years-vox-com-reconsiders-card-stacks/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"vox.com","author":"Karin Halperin","date":"2018-08-23T13:05:07.947+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/vox.com/"}}
