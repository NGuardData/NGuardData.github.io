It focuses on black celebrities, particularly musicians, athletes, and reality television personalities. It also posts content related to politics, strange crimes, and other odd news, and publishes photo-heavy list stories.</p>\n<p>Headlines and stories are sharply opinionated and often use conversational slang and social media lingo to report the news. Typical articles on the site have run under headlines such as “Ha-Ha, Beyotch! Aryan Avenger #ApartmentPatty Fired For Attempting To Impede African-American Entry;” “Let It Age: Usher’s Struggly Midlife Crisis Album Is Getting Dragged To the Clinic and Back;” and “The Most Miraculous Man Glo-Ups Of All Time.”</p>\n<p>The site’s sections include Bolitics (politics), SMH (or Shake My Head, which the site says includes stories about “Child Support, Deadbeat Dads &#x26; More!”); Jesus Take the Wheel (said to be for “Crazy News, Stupid Crimes &#x26; Recent Deaths”); and What The Hell???</p>\n<p>Bossip.com promotes its exclusive interviews of celebrities and reality TV stars such as the Kardashians. But its content is predominantly based on the reporting of other outlets, including local newspapers and television news sites, gossip sites such as TMZ.com, and social media posts and photos.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Bossip.com does not disclose a political or ideological orientation, yet many of its stories contain sharp opinion, often from a liberal perspective.</p>\n<p>For example, stories about President Trump have called him “unhinged,” “orange,” and “Cheeto.” Bossip.com stories have referred to Trump aide Kellyanne Conway as a “blonde piece of decaying fruit” and “potato salad faced.”  </p>\n<p>In October 2018, a Bossip.com story, based on an Associated Press report that Georgia gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp held up thousands of voter registrations in his role as Georgia’s secretary of state, began: “Is Republican candidate for governor Brian Kemp using the power of his current office to suppress votes from people of color? It sure looks that way.”</p>\n<p>Because the site does not acknowledge a point of view and yet often infuses articles with opinion that is critical of the Trump administration and conservatives, NewsGuard has determined that it does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>In September 2018, Bossip.com published a story based on a posting from ABC14News.com, a site that NewsGuard has determined publishes made-up news and is not connected with an ABC station. The false story, attributed to an unnamed “investigator” and an unnamed “victims rights group,” claimed that a mother in Morgantown, West Virginia, fatally shot a registered sex offender who was attempting to rape her 12-year-old daughter. Local police say the incident never happened. </p>\n<p>NewsGuard did not find other examples of blatantly false stories on the site, which is why we have not found that it repeatedly publishes false content.</p>\n<p>The site does not have a clear corrections policy, and NewsGuard could not find evidence of corrections on the website.</p>\n<p>Three emails and one telephone call from NewsGuard to editors at Bossip.com and to the site’s owner, Interactive One Media, inquiring about its mixing of news and opinion and its approach to corrections, drew no response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site lists several top editors, but its articles are credited only to “Bossip Staff” and no writers are identified.</p>\n<p>The site discloses its ownership in small-print copyright language at the bottom of the site, which does not meet NewsGuard’s standards for adequate disclosure of ownership.</p>\n<p>Advertising and sponsored content are distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<p>Two emails and one telephone call from NewsGuard seeking comment on the site’s lack of disclosure about its ownership and content creators did not receive a response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Bossip.com was registered in 2006.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJeremy Binckes\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric
