The VOA Charter, signed in 1976 by President Gerald Ford, and the International Broadcasting Act, outline principles to protect the editorial independence of VOA from government intervention. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The broadcaster says its content, mostly global and U.S. political news, and stories about everyday life in America, is transmitted to approximately 100 countries. VOAnews.com publishes short text stories, video clips, and radio and television broadcasts, which include interviews by journalists such as former cable TV host Greta Van Susteren.  The topics include politics, technology, health, international crises, and news aimed at college students.</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2018, voanews.com also published a separate section related to Iran, which was translated into English by the Persian language division. VOA’s director of public relations, Bridget Serchak, told NewsGuard in an email that VOA hopes to create similar news streams for other major language divisions.</p>\n<p>VOANews.com links to a separate site with editorials, which it says presents “differing points of view on a wide variety of issues,” but also expresses U.S. government policies. During the summer of 2018, editorials.voa.gov posted a piece that summarized as productive the June 2018 meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as well as an essay on the history of Independence Day.</p>\n<p>VOANews.com also publishes stories from other news sources, including Reuters and The Associated Press.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>VOA employs a staff of more than 1,000. The broadcaster’s director, Amanda Bennett, has held top editorial positions at Bloomberg News and The Philadelphia Inquirer, and shared a Pulitzer Prize for reporting at The Wall Street Journal.</p>\n<p>VOA reporting is governed by the VOA charter, a U.S. law that commits VOA to reporting that is accurate and objective, represents all segments of American society, and presents “responsible discussions and opinion” of U.S. policies. VOANews.org also outlines its journalistic code, which states that VOA staff do not speak for the U.S. government. The code pledges to correct errors or omissions  “at the earliest opportunity.”</p>\n<p>When a 2013 law enabled Voice of America to begin broadcasting within the U.S., news outlets including Foreign Policy magazine expressed concern that the broadcaster would begin publishing content skewed to support U.S. government positions.</p>\n<p>Politico and The New Republic expressed similar concerns about a December 2016 rules change that replaced the Broadcasting Board of Governors’ (now the U.S. Agency for Global Media) bipartisan advisory board with a CEO appointed by the president. Serchak said the president’s nominee must still be approved by the U.S. Senate, and that the CEO is prohibited by provisions in the International Broadcasting Act from influencing VOA news coverage. </p>\n<p>VOA reporters and editors also attended required training by the Poynter Institute for Media Studies in 2018 on the “firewall” between the agency and government.</p>\n<p>VOA has a record of reporting that has been tough on President Trump, publishing stories such as a critical Associated Press article: “Life in Trump's Cabinet: Perks, Pestering, Power, Putdowns.” </p>\n<p>In October 2018, VOA dismissed or disciplined 15 employees from its Hausa language service, which serves an audience in Nigeria and other parts of west Africa, after it was revealed that they had accepted cash bribes from a Nigerian state governor. An internal investigation by VOA Africa officials concluded that programming was unaffected by the payments, and Bennett, writing in a staff email, underscored VOA’s commitment to upholding the publication’s standards. “If any other instances of improper payments are discovered in any service anywhere in VOA, we are committed to investigating them thoroughly and dealing with them promptly as well,” she stated. By year’s end, a VOA investigation continued.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site’s About Us tab links to its Press Relations website, insidevoa.com, where VOA details its history, mission, key staff, and connection to the U.S. government.</p>\n<p>Voanews.com names its top executives and division directors, publishes phone, email and office addresses, and has a media outreach tab. Articles involving significant original reporting name the author and sometimes provide contact and biographical information. Serchak said that providing a biography is voluntary, but reporters are “strongly encouraged” to provide one. </p>\n<p>Some articles based on wire stories, news releases, or televised events are simply attributed to “VOA News,” she said.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>VOA was founded in 1942 to combat Nazi propaganda in World War II. The website was launched in 2000. In 2013, the U.S. government amended a law that had prevented VOA News from broadcasting its programming within the U.S., making the programs available in the U.S. online and upon request by broadcasters.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This label has been updated to reflect that the Smith-Mundt Act, which previously prevented VOA from broadcasting in the U.S., was amended, not repealed, as was previously stated.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
