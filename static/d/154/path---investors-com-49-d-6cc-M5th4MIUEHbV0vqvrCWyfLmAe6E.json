Scott O’Neil, the son of Investor’s Business Daily founder William O’Neil, is the CEO of Data Analysis Inc.</p>\n<p>Investors.com generates revenue through display advertisements and sponsored content. It also charges digital subscription fees for premium content, and sells products, such as MarketSmith, a stock-research tool, and SwingTrader, a system that helps investors identify and capitalize on short-term financial trends.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Investors.com’s content focuses on U.S. stock market analysis. Its main menu includes sections on market trends, stock lists, research, and how to invest. Stories offer perspective, such as one that proposed the possible upside of a falling market could be the pressure it would exert on politicians to act in the economy’s interest. Other stories update the market’s movements, highlighting the significance of individual stocks’ gains and losses.</p>\n<p>The website publishes text articles and videos, such as “How To Find The Top-Rated Stocks In The Top-Ranked Industries” and “Here's What To Know About Portfolio Construction And Asset Allocation.” Its video content also includes webinars on financial topics.</p>\n<p>The website has a Politics section, which contains conservative-leaning editorials and columns from writers such as radio host Larry Elder and DailyWire.com founder and editor-in-chief Ben Shapiro. Another section on the site, The Trump Economy, focuses on President Donald Trump’s policies and features posts, such as “Market Turmoil Shows Why Trump’s Pro-Growth Policies Must Continue,” and news articles, including “Did Trump Call It? His Tax Cuts Just Socked H&#x26;R Block.”</p>\n<p>Investor’s Business Daily partners with TechnoMetrica to produce monthly polling that assesses how Americans view the president and their policies, as well as the economy and the direction of the U.S.</p>\n<p>In addition to its staff stories, the website publishes content from the Bloomberg news service.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Stories on the site are generally produced by Investor’s Business Daily journalists, who use market statistics, financial industry leaders and company spokespeople as direct sources. The website’s news stories are objectively reported or written from an advisory or analytical perspective. Opinionated posts, including editorials and columns, are prominently labeled above headlines to distinguish them from news content.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard could not locate a corrections policy on the website, but found examples of corrections posted online to stories with errors. Headlines reflect the content of stories.</p>\n<p>In April 2018, Investor’s Business Daily published an editorial headlined “A Startling New Discovery Could Destroy All Those Global Warming Doomsday Forecasts,” which was cited by an environmental fact-checking website as inaccurate.  The editorial, referring to a study published in Science magazine about the Earth’s nitrogen supply, said that plants might be able to offset the effects of climate change with more access to nitrogen in bedrock. “With more nitrogen available, plant life might be able to absorb more CO2 than climate scientists have been estimating, which means the planet won't warm as much, despite mankind's pumping CO2 into the atmosphere,” the editorial said</p>\n<p>Climate news fact-checking website Climate Feedback, quoting scientists who reviewed the editorial, called the editorial “incorrect and poorly reasoned.” An author of the Science magazine study, University of California-Davis professor Benjamin Houlton, told Climate Feedback, “Our study does not suggest or imply that rock nitrogen will solve global climate change.”</p>\n<p>Investor’s Business Daily responded in a subsequent editorial, saying the publication did not claim what Climate Feedback said it did. “The headline in our editorial says the study <em>\"could\"</em> render doomsday forecasts obsolete,” Investors.com wrote. “There's an important distinction between \"could\" and \"will.\"”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Stories clearly identify authors in most instances. Users can click on authors’ names to access archive pages of their work. However, these pages do not share any contact or biographical information about the site’s writers. The website also does not identify its owner or top editors.</p>\n<p>An Investor’s Business Daily editor did not respond to a NewsGuard phone message and email seeking comment on the lack of information about the publication’s owner, editors, and content creators.</p>\n<p>Advertising and sponsored content are distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>William O’Neil, a stockbroker who previously founded securities research firm William O’Neil + Co. Inc., founded Investor’s Business Daily in 1984. O’Neil saw an opportunity for a publication to offer better, more effective advice on the stock market than newspapers offered at the time, according to an About page on the site. The publication shifted from a daily to weekly print format in 2016. The investors.com domain name was created in 1994.</p>\n<p>Investor’s Business Daily won the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartoons by Michael Ramirez.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSam
