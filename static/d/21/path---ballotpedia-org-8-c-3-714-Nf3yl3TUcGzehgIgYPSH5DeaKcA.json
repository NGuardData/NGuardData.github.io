Founded in 2006, the sole purpose of the Lucy Burns Institute is to sponsor and run Ballotpedia. The Lucy Burns Institute is financed through private contributions from individuals and philanthropic foundations, which totaled $4.2 million in 2016, according to its latest publicly available tax filing. The funds are used to pay the Ballotpedia staff of researchers, writers, and editors.</p>\n<p>According to Ballotpedia’s Editorial Independence policy page, the site accepts “gifts, grants and sponsorships from individuals and organizations.” It also runs advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content </h3>\n<p>Ballotpedia describes itself in its About page as “the digital encyclopedia of American politics and elections.” Ballotpedia’s mission is “to inform people about politics by providing accurate and objective information about politics at all levels of government.”</p>\n<p>Ballotpedia.org divides its content into sections including Election Resources, Government (U.S. President, U.S. Congress, State Legislatures, and School Boards,) Politics (Trump Administration, Supreme Court Cases, and Fact Checks,) and Public Policy (including Budget, Campaign Finance, Education, Energy, Healthcare, and Immigration.)</p>\n<p>Each section and subsection has an interactive, Wikipedia-style encyclopedia entry. For example, the State Executives subsection (found under the Government section) provides  a general overview of the state officials up for election. Users can click on a U.S. map to learn about state executives and specific offices, such as governor or labor commissioner, to learn more about that role. The State Executives page also has pages focused on past elections at the federal, state, and local level. For example, the State Executive Official Elections 2016 page includes Ballotpedia’s 2016 election analysis and thorough breakdown of public policy disputes that year.</p>\n<p>The site’s homepage prominently features Ballotpedia’s Sample Ballot Lookup tool, which allows users to enter a zip code and read information about candidates running in that area. The homepage also provides the most recent edition of Ballotpedia’s nine newsletters, including “The Federal Tap,” a weekly review of federal politics, and “Bold Justice,” containing summaries of the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court and other federal courts.</p>\n<p>Ballotpedia has published more than 260,000 articles written and curated by a staff of more than 50 editors, writers, and researchers, according to the site. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility </h3>\n<p>Ballotpedia describes itself as striving to produce content that is neutral, accurate, and verifiable. Its lengthy Neutrality Policy, written by Wikipedia co-founder and Ballotpedia consultant Larry Sanger, states: “If you’re neutral, you don’t take a position. You present all sides fairly and let your reader decide which is correct.” </p>\n<p>Ballotpedia’s articles are fact-based, citing and linking to credible primary sources. Articles frequently link to other Ballotpedia articles about politicians or topics.</p>\n<p>For example, Ballotpedia’s article on ”Investigation and impeachment proceedings of West Virginia Supreme Court justices (2018)” includes a straightforward headline, a short summary, a list of justices under investigation, links to related Ballotpedia articles, and a detailed timeline of events. Readers can click on each timeline event, such as “October 15, 2018: Senators responded to the Supreme Court's October 11 ruling,” for a full description. Below the timeline, a lengthy section provides background information, citing relevant statutes and laws.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Ballotpedia is regularly cited by media outlets, including Fox News, the Washington Post, Reuters, and Bloomberg. NBC News cited Ballotpedia’s data in a September 2018 article “Ahead of midterms, Democrats lead in cash, candidates and voters.” In September 2018,The New York Times cited Ballotpedia as a source for its article, “These 20 Representatives Have Not Had a Primary Challenger for at Least a Decade.”</p>\n<p>Ballotpedia has also worked with media outlets to produce political stories or reports. For example, Ballotpedia worked with The Wall Street Journal to produce the November 2017 article \"Ballot Measure to Cap Ohio Drug Prices Unleashes Expensive Ad Battle.” In August and September 2018, the election website FiveThirtyEight partnered with Ballotpedia to produce series about the 2018 primaries.</p>\n<p>Ballotpedia provides three methods for readers to report errors: Submitting an online form, alerting the site via its chat function  or sending an email to a general Ballotpedia editor email address. Corrections are inserted directly into articles or entries.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency </h3>\n<p>The site’s Ballotpedia Staff page provides names, titles, email addresses, and biographical information for its writers and editorial leaders. Individual staff pages include information about their latest contributions to the site. In keeping with encyclopedic style, individual articles are not published with author names; readers can learn what articles a writer has authored by referencing their staff page. </p>\n<p>The site’s About page discloses its ownership and sponsorship by the Lucy Burns Institute, and a separate page provides background information on the institute, including its history, board of directors, and links to its page on Guidestar, as site that chronicles the nonprofit sector. Users can download the Institute’s IRS Forms 990 and access financial information. Ballotpedia also links to the Lucy Burns Institute corporate website, which features its 2016 Form 990, its Audited Financials, and its Annual Reports since 2013. </p>\n<p>However, the site does not appear to publish information about its major donors, which does not meet NewsGuard’s standard for nonprofits disclosing their ownership and financing.</p>\n<p>Ballotpedia’s director of communications did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are distinguished from the site’s editorial content with the label “Ad.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History </h3>\n<p>Ballotpedia was founded in 2007 by Leslie Graves, a Wisconsin resident frustrated with the lack of easily accessible information about local government, the site states. In late 2006, Graves founded the Lucy Burns Institute, which first launched WikiFOIA, a resource for state-level Freedom of Information laws. In 2009, the Lucy Burns Institute took over sponsorship of Ballotpedia and Judgepedia from another nonprofit, the Sam Adams Alliance. Ballotpedia and Judgepedia merged in 2015.</p>\n<p>Ballotpedia began as a repository of U.S. ballot measures. The site’s scope has expanded to include information on political candidates and general U.S. political information. </p>\n<p>The Institute was named after Lucy Burns, a suffragette who helped organize the National Woman’s Party in 1916.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling\n\nEdited by:\nEric Effron&#x26;emsp;Macaela
