It also has a “Store” link at the top of every page that brings readers to KeepandBear.com, a conservative news site owned by Romulus Marketing, a media company that runs other hyperpartisan conservative news sites.</p>\n<p>A link at the bottom of articles brings readers to a Patreon page for Joe Newby and Conservative Firing Line. Patreon is a subscription platform service that allows “patrons” to contribute funds in support of specific people and organizations. Another link takes users to a GoFundMe page for NewsArmor, a conservative group aiming to “Fight Facebook Censorship.” NewsArmor also appears to be connected to Brandon Vallorani, co-founder of Romulus Marketing.</p>\n<p>ConservativeFiringLine.com did not respond to four NewsGuard messages sent through its contact form seeking information about the site’s ownership and its relationship with Romulus Marketing.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>An About Us page says the site was started “to inform, educate and inspire grassroots conservatives at all levels.” It portrays President Donald Trump and his allies in a positive light, and liberals and Democrats in a negative light. The site regularly warns about a growing Jihadist movement within the U.S. </p>\n<p>The site publishes content that draws on reporting from others, with some original reporting as well. The site also bases some content on social media posts and viral videos. Articles contain conservative commentary, even if not in the opinion section.</p>\n<p>Sections include Politics,Terrorism, Education, and Crime. It also publishes syndicated political cartoons.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>ConservativeFiringLine publishes conspiracy theories. For example in August 2018, the site published a story about how Hillary Clinton’s “ASSASSINATION SQUAD” killed DNC staffer Seth Rich in 2016. The story repeated debunked claims about Rich’s murder, which investigators ruled a robbery gone wrong.</p>\n<p>In June 2018, the site claimed that television host Anthony Bourdain was killed by Clinton operatives and implied that designer Kate Spade was murdered by the Clintons as well. Both Bourdain and Spade committed suicide. Both stories were written by Adina Kutnicki, a writer who regularly contributes essays about what she portrays as creeping Islamic fascism in the U.S. The essays link to her own blog as a source.</p>\n<p>The site links to a story on Kutnicki’s blog which states that former President Barack Obama “is deeply hooked into the Muslim Brotherhood Mafia,” and also a “dope fiend.” That story links to a “new report” that shows Hezbollah “maintains a network of sleeper cells in the United States.” That link leads to a story about a report from the nonprofit Investigative Project on Terrorism. The Project’s blog (not a “report”) did not mention any new findings about Jihadists sleeper cells “prepping” for violence in the U.S.</p>\n<p>Because the site links to non-credible sources and makes claims that are not backed by supporting links, NewsGuard has determined the site does not gather and present news responsibly.</p>\n<p>The site does not appear to run corrections. It also regularly injects opinion into articles that do not run in the Opinion section. A 2018 story titled “Socialist Ocasio-Cortez: Defeating Global Warming Just Like Beating Nazi Germany,” said then-congressional candidate Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez of New York City had a “tiny, tiny head” and a “simple mind,” was “not the brightest crayon in the box,” and had fewer brain cells than some bricks. Another 2018 article titled “Video: Liberal Lunatic Rosie O’Donnell wants military to take Trump out of White House,” called MSNBC “the official network of insane liberal hate.” </p>\n<p>Headlines accurately represent the content of stories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Stories generally provide author names, although some content is credited only to “CFL staff.” The site provides a brief bio for Newby but does not provide biographical information for other writers. The site does not list staff, and does not provide contact information for writers.</p>\n<p>ConservativeFiringLine does not state its ownership, although the biography for Newby says he “now runs” the site. The “Contact Us” page provides a contact form, but does not provide an email address or phone number.</p>\n<p>The site differentiates advertising from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Conservativefiringline.com was launched in May 2012.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label incorrectly stated that the site does not conduct any original reporting.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nPeter Janecky\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a
