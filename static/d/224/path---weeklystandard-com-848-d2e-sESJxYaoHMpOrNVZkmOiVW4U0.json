Anschutz has subsidiaries in the real estate, energy, and entertainment sectors. Clarity Media Group also publishes The Washington Examiner and Red Alert Politics. The Standard earns revenue from subscriptions and advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content </h3>\n<p>Weeklystandard.com publishes stories from the print magazine as well as web-exclusive content, podcasts, and a Swing State section with updated projections for the 2018 midterm U.S. Senate elections. The Today and Editorial sections feature analysis and commentary, with a conservative slant, about social and political current events. The Weekly Standard also publishes fact checks of recent news stories by other media, including conservative outlets.</p>\n<p>Its primary subject is politics and government, and it has proven a frequent conservative critic of President Trump. For example, longtime writer-editor Fred Barnes’ “Trump Tries Something Surprising: Self-Control” noted Trump’s initial and uncharacteristically understated response to a September 2018 allegation of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. William Kristol, a prominent conservative commentator who was the magazine’s founding editor and now serves as editor-at-large, has written, “Donald Trump is in many ways a bad president—bad for the country, bad for conservatism, bad for the Republican party. His sway over party and policy should be limited as much as is feasible and his dominance of our politics not extended any longer than necessary.” It takes on other notable conservatives, such as author-pundit Dinesh D’Souza, whom it pilloried in both a long story and a Daily Standard Podcast called “The Decline of Dinesh.”</p>\n<p>The website’s editorial expansion into non-political areas includes The Tuesday Morning Quarterback section that provides in-depth coverage of football, including statistics and analysis of player trades, individual games, and rules changes. The website also publishes reviews of books, film, and art exhibits.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Stories are generally well sourced, referencing public records as well as reporting by other news organizations such as CNN, The Washington Post, and Politico. A fact-check feature is well sourced and verifies claims made against both Republicans and Democrats. It also researches stories outside of politics, such as the way in which automatic weapons can be made from 3D printers. It criticized as bogus the claim by both a conservative site and a news aggregator that Malia Obama, daughter of the former president, was suspended by Harvard University for a “anti-white rant.” It wrote, “Not a lick of this is true.”</p>\n<p>Although The Weekly Standard promotes conservative views, it does not explicitly disclose its political ideology on the website nor does it clearly distinguish between news and opinion. While it does label some editorial content, opinions appear in stories throughout the website, most notably in the Today section where The Standard publishes both print and web-only content. The Standard often produces stories that focus on perceived missteps of Trump and his administration, including American policy in Afghanistan and the Mueller investigation of Russian influence in the 2016 presidential campaign. A 2018 story, “Losing a War,” describes Trump as “an instinctive president—and an impatient one,” and the Trump administration as “freewheeling.” The story was not labeled as opinion. Another story was based on a tweet by a Democratic California congressman who chided Republican Sen. Susan Collins for disclosing that her office had received “pretty ugly voicemails” about the confirmation process involving Kavanaugh (“Boo Hoo Hoo,” Rep. Eric Swalwell tweeted. “You’re a senator who police will protect”).  The writer noted Swalwell’s ultimate apology, but  also called the episode “silly,” and wrote, “If you think this story is bad enough already, then please, for the love of the Almighty, don’t read the comments” on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Asked why The Weekly Standard does not explicitly state its political ideology, online Managing Editor Rachael Larimore told NewsGuard in an emailed reply that the publication “has never shied away from characterization by others as a conservative magazine, and our editorials generally take a conservative point of view. It generally seems unnecessary. Many publications that have clear ideological leanings characterize themselves as a general interest publication, generally to appeal to advertisers.”</p>\n<p>Larimore also told NewsGuard that “it's oversimplifying our work to try to draw a black and white line between news and opinion...We trust our readers to be able to judge what is straight news and what includes commentary or opinion. If a piece talks about legislation and includes quotes from sources in Congress about that legislation, it's pretty much straight news. If there is a piece that says something is good or bad, or tries to influence how people think, it's probably commentary or opinion. But there's often a mix in there.”</p>\n<p>In 2017, Facebook approved The Standard as one of its third-party fact-checkers. To join the group, organizations must work toward the principles of the International Fact Checking Network, a division within The Poynter Institute for Media Studies. Those principles include nonpartisan fact-checking, transparency in process and methodology, and the disclosure of funding.</p>\n<p>The site does not state a general corrections policy, but NewsGuard independently verified that The Weekly Standard regularly makes corrections. The corrected sentence is marked with an asterisk, and a correction at the bottom of articles clarifies the error and notes that the text has been changed.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The Weekly Standard names authors and provides information about them, including links to their social media accounts. The About Us page lists writers, editors, and senior staff, and discloses ownership. Readers may contact editors by email. The Weekly Standard has a policy not to give out the email addresses or contact information of authors without their permission. Advertising is clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation started The Weekly Standard in 1995. Kristol served as editor for 21 years until stepping down in 2016 to be editor-at-large, handing over editorial oversight to editors Steve Hayes and Richard Starr.</p>\n<p>Although the Standard reported annual losses estimated between $1 million and $5 million, Murdoch was reluctant to sell it, according to a New Yorker profile. Murdoch eventually sold The Weekly Standard to Philip Anschutz, a conservative billionaire businessman, in 2009. The Weekly Standard became more influential after 9/11. Its views on national security became so favored by the Bush administration that The New York Times called the magazine “one of the most influential publications in Washington” despite its small size. Upon Kristol stepping down, Rich Lowry, editor of The National Review, a conservative media stalwart, said that Kristol “created a media institution out of nothing” and that it remained “lively and very influential.”</p>\n<p>In December 2018, Clarity Media announced it would be shutting the Standard, citing a poor financial performance and a steady decline in subscribers in recent years. Following the announcement, President Trump celebrated the news in a tweet, calling the magazine that had embraced the #NeverTrump movement, “pathetic and dishonest.”</p>\n<p>John Podhoretz, a co-founder of the Standard, criticized the decision in Commentary magazine. Podhoretz said that the Standard was not “killed because it was hostile to Donald Trump,” but instead suggested that Clarity Media might cynically harvest the Standard’s subscribers for another publication. Podhoretz called the end of the Standard “an intellectual and political crime.”</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nJohn Gregory&#x26;emsp;Jim
