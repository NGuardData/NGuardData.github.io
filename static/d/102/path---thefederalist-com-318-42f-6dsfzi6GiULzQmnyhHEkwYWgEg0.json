Securities and Exchange Commission paperwork for the company lists four people as company executives or directors -- John and Jenn McIntyre, Ben Domenech and Sean Davis. Davis was previously the chief financial officer for the conservative Daily Caller website. Domenech is a political blogger. John McIntyre is the co-founder and CEO for RealClear Media, a group of news and commentary websites. </p>\n<p>FDRLST Media has shared a Chicago mailing address with RealClearPolitics. A September 2017 SEC filing for FDRLST Media indicates the company offered $750,000 of debt for sale, and sold $200,000 to two investors. The Federalist displays advertising on its website and sells newsletter subscriptions. The website also promotes a “swag shop” with branded clothing.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content </h3>\n<p>The website displays the motto, “Be lovers of freedom and anxious for the fray” at the bottom of its pages. The site features articles and podcasts about culture, lifestyle, politics and political analysis, in news articles and unlabeled opinion pieces. Headlines generally match the content of the stories.</p>\n<p>A July 2018 article titled “Watch The Left Go Crazy On Twitter Over Trump’s SCOTUS Pick” is typical of the site’s conservative and opinionated approach to the news, as was another July 2018 article, “‘White House Should Defend Diplomats,’ Says Hillary Clinton, Who Let U.S. Diplomats Die.” The site also publishes lifestyles content, such “Heeled Crocs Are A Leap Into Inglorious Shoe Barbarism” and “7 Americans Recall Watching The Stunning Moment A Man First Walked On The Moon.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility </h3>\n<p>Articles on The Federalist are based on firsthand reporting, reference reliable sources, and link to work produced by other news outlets, including The New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, National Review, BBC News and NBC News.</p>\n<p>The site regularly publishes corrections as notes at the end of articles, explaining the error and the corrected information. Headlines accurately reflect the content in stories and columns.</p>\n<p>Opinion and analysis are rarely labeled as such. For example, “Serena Williams’ Tweet About Missing Her Child’s First Steps Shows How To Accept Trade-Offs Of Modern Motherhood,” is written from the author’s personal experience as a mother, offering a mix of advice and solidarity with Williams.</p>\n<p>A July 2018 post titled “Donald Trump’s Trade War Is Proving The Free Traders Right” is a mix of analysis and opinion by then-Federalist senior writer Robert Tracinski, with block quotes from outside sources, but gives no indication that the piece is an opinion post. A total of four NewsGuard emails sent to the site and its top editors seeking comment about its handling of news and opinion received no response.</p>\n<p>Most posts include the writer’s name, but others are written anonymously. Some articles spell out specific reasons why an author was allowed to remain unidentified. A February 2018 post, “Thank Goodness My Kids’ School Lets Trained Faculty Carry A Gun,” explained that, “The author is an occasional Federalist writer who requested anonymity to protect her kids’ and their school’s safety.” In August 2018, the site retroactively added a disclaimer to about a dozen pieces, explaining that the site grants anonymity in situations when publishing writers’ bylines “would credibly threaten close personal relationships, their safety, or their jobs.” The disclaimer also states that TheFederalist.com verifies the authors’ identities. </p>\n<p>A total of four NewsGuard emails sent to the site and its top editors seeking comment about its identification of unnamed writers did not receive a response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>A tagline on the website describes The Federalist as “a wholly independent division of FDRLST Media,” but provides no additional information about the site’s ownership. The Federalist’s website lists Davis as a co-founder. Domenech is listed as the site’s publisher. The other two officers listed as owners of FDRLST Media, John and Jenn McIntyre, are not listed on the website. A total of four emails sent to the website, Domenech, and executive editor Joy Pullmann asking about its ownership disclosure were not answered.</p>\n<p>Two emails to John McIntyre, and a phone call to RealClearPolitics’ Washington office, asking about McIntyre’s connection to The Federalist were not returned.</p>\n<p>The site lists its editorial managers, staff writers, and outside contributors,except for the unnamed writers in particular posts. Contact information, including social media accounts and personal websites, are available for most regularly featured writers. Biographies are available for some as well. Email addresses are usually not posted. The website publishes a general email address and physical address on its Contact Us page.</p>\n<p>The site publishes editor’s notes to readers for a variety of reasons, including warning the reader about possibly offensive words in a post, and informing the audience that the post contains movie or television spoilers.The notes are in italics and usually appear near the top  of the article. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History </h3>\n<p>The Federalist was launched in September 2013, as a “new web magazine on politics, policy, and culture.” In a post announcing the site, Domenech said The Federalist would be modeled in part by an early version of Time magazine, distilling the news for middle class readers through a conservative lens.</p>\n<p>Before The Federalist, Domenech was a co-founder of the website RedState.com, which launched in 2004. In 2006, Domenech wrote for the Washington Post’s “Red America” blog, but left within three days, after other news outlets disclosed what appeared to be examples of plagiarism in pieces he wrote during and after college. He told a media writer for the Post that he did not knowingly publish work unattributed. When the same writer asked Domenech about reports that he had referred to Coretta Scott King as a “communist” in an article he wrote for RedState.com, Domenech said “I regret using the term,” adding “I'm there to do opinion. That's what I do. I'm not a journalist.”</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This label has been updated and the rating has been changed to reflect that TheFederalist.com regularly makes corrections to errors.</em></p>\n<p><em>Corrections: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label erroneously reported that the site’s co-owner, John Domenech, is identified on the website as a co-founder.
