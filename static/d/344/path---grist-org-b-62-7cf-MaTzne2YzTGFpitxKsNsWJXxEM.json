Brady Walkinshaw, a former Democratic Washington state representative and congressional candidate, has been CEO of Grist since March 2017. Grist publishes an annual report disclosing that its revenues come from grants, donations, and advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>On its About Grist page, the site describes itself as “a beacon in the smog – an independent, irreverent news outlet and network of innovators working toward a planet that doesn’t burn and a future that doesn’t suck.” Grist publishes both original stories and articles from other sources through Climate Desk, a collaboration among more than a dozen organizations including The Atlantic, Mother Jones, and The Guardian.</p>\n<p>Typical stories include “Ohio’s Watershed Moment: How to Fix Lake Erie Algae.” Typical headlines include “There are more ways to fight climate change than giving up meat” and “The Green New Deal: How to fix the economy without breaking the planet.” The site contains videos and articles on energy, climate, food, business, and technology. Grist publishes an annual Grist 50, a list of 50 people “cooking up the boldest, most ambitious solutions to humanity's biggest challenges.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles often feature firsthand reporting and provide extensive links to outside sources. Headlines accurately reflect content, albeit worded in a casual tone at times, such as “Did the EPA borrow its latest PR strategy from my teenage self?”</p>\n<p>Grist is upfront about its environmental agenda, stating on its About page “Climate, sustainability, and social justice are the most important stories on the … well, on the planet right now.” Thus, many articles warn of the threat of climate change. Reporting is backed by evidence and widely-accepted research. Because Grist is clear about its point of view and does not distort facts to advance its ideology, NewsGuard concluded the site handles the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>When there is an error, Grist updates articles and appends a correction notice to the bottom of the article.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The website states that it is “an independent, nonprofit media organization devoted to eye-opening environmental journalism,” as stated on page titled The Grist Team. The page names and provides biographical information for members of Grist’s staff, including the CEO, founder, board members, and editorial leadership. Most articles contain names of authors, and link to the author’s biography, Twitter account, and other articles. Grist provides pages to submit comments, story pitches, and confidential news tips.</p>\n<p>The site publishes an Editorial Independence Policy that commits Grist to naming all individuals and foundations that contribute more than $5,000 annually, and states: “We retain full authority over editorial content and our news judgments are made independent of donor support.” Donors and other financial details are disclosed in an annual report published on the site. Advertisements are distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Chip Giller, a former editor for the environmental news daily Greenwire, founded the site in 1999. Walkinshaw took over as CEO in 2017.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2017/03/07/brady-walkinshaw-new-grist-ceo-seattle-environment.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2017/03/07/brady-walkinshaw-new-grist-ceo-seattle-environment.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grist.org/about/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/about/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/61664153\" target=\"_blank\">https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/61664153</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.guidestar.org/profile/06-1664153\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.guidestar.org/profile/06-1664153</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/grist-annual-report-20161.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/grist-annual-report-20161.pdf</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grist.org/article/there-are-more-ways-to-fight-climate-change-than-giving-up-meat/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/article/there-are-more-ways-to-fight-climate-change-than-giving-up-meat/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grist.org/article/the-green-new-deal-how-to-fix-the-economy-without-breaking-the-planet/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/article/the-green-new-deal-how-to-fix-the-economy-without-breaking-the-planet/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grist.org/about/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/about/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.climatedesk.org/about-us\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.climatedesk.org/about-us</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grist.org/briefly/did-the-epa-borrow-its-latest-pr-strategy-from-my-teenage-self/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/briefly/did-the-epa-borrow-its-latest-pr-strategy-from-my-teenage-self/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grist.org/article/midterms-moderate-republicans-bipartisanship-on-climate-what-comes-next/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/article/midterms-moderate-republicans-bipartisanship-on-climate-what-comes-next/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grist.org/article/new-york-just-filed-a-big-ol-lawsuit-against-exxonmobil/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/article/new-york-just-filed-a-big-ol-lawsuit-against-exxonmobil/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grist.org/article/severe-weather-could-dampen-election-day/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/article/severe-weather-could-dampen-election-day/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grist.org/article/hurricane-michael-is-a-monster-storm-and-an-unnatural-disaster/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/article/hurricane-michael-is-a-monster-storm-and-an-unnatural-disaster/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-D-16-0134.1\" target=\"_blank\">https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-D-16-0134.1</a></li>\n<li>Correction <a href=\"https://grist.org/article/uber-and-lyft-passengers-are-ultra-wealthy-will-this-keep-cities-from-investing-in-transit/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/article/uber-and-lyft-passengers-are-ultra-wealthy-will-this-keep-cities-from-investing-in-transit/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p>Correction <a href=\"https://grist.org/article/billionaires-and-bacteria-are-racing-to-save-us-from-death-by-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/article/billionaires-and-bacteria-are-racing-to-save-us-from-death-by-fertilizer/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grist.org/advertising/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/advertising/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grist.org/about/writers/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/about/writers/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grist.org/team/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/team/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grist.org/article/scherer-christian/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/article/scherer-christian/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grist.org/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/contact/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://grist.org/editorial-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/editorial-policy/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chipgiller/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/chipgiller/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://skoll.org/contributor/chip-giller/\" target=\"_blank\">http://skoll.org/contributor/chip-giller/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grist.org/about/how-to-leak-to-grist/\" target=\"_blank\">https://grist.org/about/how-to-leak-to-grist/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"grist.org","author":"Sarah Brandt","date":"2018-11-19T16:42:26.884+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/grist.org/"}}
