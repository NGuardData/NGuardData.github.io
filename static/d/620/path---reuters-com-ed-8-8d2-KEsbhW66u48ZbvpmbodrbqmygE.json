A majority of the company is controlled by the Thomson family, the richest family in Canada, through its Woodbridge investment company. The family also owns the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. News organizations pay a subscription fee to Reuters for use of its content, including articles, pictures and video footage -- a fee that varies depending on the size of the subscriber’s organization and which services it uses.</p>\n<p>Reuters.com carries advertisements as well as sponsored content.</p>\n<p>According to Thomson Reuters’ 2017 annual report, the news division brought in $296 million in revenue and $27 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Reuters News accounted for only 3 percent of the company’s total revenue in 2017. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Reuters coverage includes business, financial markets, international news, politics, technology, sports and lifestyle. Content is published in a variety of formats, including video and infographics, in addition to text. A special section on the site covers stories related to two Reuters journalists who have been imprisoned in Myanmar since Dec. 2017.</p>\n<p>As of January 2019, Reuters says it employs 2,500 journalists and 600 photojournalists reporting from about 200 locations around the world.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>A commitment to “always correct an error openly” is in the company’s list of “10 Absolutes of Reuters Journalism,” and the corrections policy is detailed in the company’s handbook. Reuters makes regular corrections and updates to stories on the site. Reuters has won five Pulitzer Prizes. In 2018, it won two Pulitzers, one for a series exposing police killing squads targeting drug offenders in the Philippines and a second award for a photographic series on the migration of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar.</p>\n<p>Reuters’ coverage of the deaths of 10 Rohingya men and boys in a Myanmar village won two British Journalism Awards in 2018 in the foreign affairs journalism and global investigation of the year categories.</p>\n<p>Reuters has gone to greater lengths than most other news outlets to avoid the appearance of emotionally charged language. Its journalism handbook, first published in 1992, states that the words “terrorist” or “terrorism” cannot be used to describe specific events, but can appear within the context of a direct quotation or paraphrase. Reuters stories can refer to terrorism or counterterrorism in general, as concepts. “Aim for a dispassionate use of language so that individuals, organisations and governments can make their own judgment on the basis of facts,” the handbook reads.</p>\n<p>Reuters refers to the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks as the Sept. 11 attacks. The attackers who flew hijacked jetliners into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a western Pennsylvania field are referred to as “suicide hijackers.” Reuters asked Canadian newspaper publisher CanWest Global Communications to remove the names of Reuters reporters when it substituted “terrorist” for terms like “insurgents” into Reuters articles in 2004. </p>\n<p>Editor-in-chief Stephen Adler encouraged its reporters to stick to its principle of “integrity, independence and freedom from bias” in a January 2017 memo titled “Covering Trump the Reuters Way.” When Rob Cox, editor of Reuters’ Breakingviews section, violated those principles by tweeting “Blood is on your hands, Mr. President,” after five people were killed at an Annapolis, Maryland newspaper, Cox apologized and deleted the tweet. Adler released a statement saying Cox’s “actions were inconsistent with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles … we do not condone his behavior and will take appropriate action.” No disciplinary action was disclosed by Reuters. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Reuters.com has a page with a general overview of its news gathering and editing process, including how it utilizes sources for covering routine events and breaking news, and how reporters, editors and photographers fact check stories. The Reuters handbook is publicly available as a more in-depth and searchable database of editorial policies. the reporting of another news organization, according to the handbook. In these cases, stories are attributed to “Reuters Staff.”  Heather Carpenter, public relations manager and head of special projects for Reuters, said that reporters also will not be named “to protect the safety of a journalist working in a dangerous area,” or if too many reporters contributed to a story to list them all individually.</p>\n<p>When stories do include a reporter’s byline, it links to a page with his or her recent work. No biographical or contact information is centrally listed for reporters or editors, other than Adler, for whom a biography is accessible. Readers who want to contact the editorial staff are directed to a general contact form.</p>\n<p>The site’s ownership by Thomson Reuters is disclosed on the homepage and is mentioned in most news stories involving Thomson Reuters. The site also has an “Editorial Leadership” page linking to the biography of editor-in-chief Stephen Adler and listing Reuters’ global leadership team and its three regional editors. Additionally, editors are listed at the bottom of each story along with the names of contributing reporters and writers, and a link to “Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.”</p>\n<p>Reuters has addressed an apparent conflict with its “Trust Principles” created by the Thomson merger. The first of these principles, adopted in 1941, says Reuters “shall at no time pass into the hands of any one interest, group, or faction.” After the Thomson Reuters merger,  however, a majority of the company is now controlled by the Thomson family. A Reuters Q&#x26;A published in January 2018 said the Thomson family was “granted an exemption” to the shareholding limit set by the Trust Principles after assuring the Reuters Founders Share Company, considered the guardian of those principles, that they would uphold them. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Reuters traces its roots to 1851, when Julius Reuter began sending stock quotes between London and Paris via a telegraph cable across the English Channel. He had previously used pigeons to carry stock information between Aachen, Germany and Brussels. The wire service expanded across Europe and then to Asia and South America by the 1870s. The Press Association, a news cooperative founded by British newspapers, bought a majority stake in Reuters in 1925. In 1941, ownership was split between the Press Association and Newspaper Proprietors’ Association, which represented Britain’s national newspapers. Ownership was later extended to press associations in Australia and New Zealand in 1947. Reuters became a publicly traded company in 1984. It merged with the Thomson Corporation in 2008.</p>\n<p>In 2010, Reuters expanded its services for U.S. news outlets by launching the Reuters America service, in an effort to draw publishers and broadcasters away from The Associated Press and CNN’s wire services at a lower subscription cost. This resulted in more U.S.-based reporters being assigned to cover major cities and sports, although according to a 2014 Poynter story, Reuters “made no attempt to build” state-by-state bureaus like the AP. The first customer was the Tribune Company, which moved seven of its major publications, including the Chicago Tribune, to Reuters by 2013. The papers went back to using the AP’s services in 2015, but Reuters has continued to invest in U.S. coverage, and hired its first “Rust Belt” correspondent in 2017. </p>\n<p>A deal completed in October 2018 sold 55 percent of Thomson Reuters’ financial and risk unit, the most profitable segment of the company, to investment firm Blackstone Group, which agreed to pay “a minimum” of $325 million per year for 30 years for Reuters to supply news and editorial content. Ownership of Reuters news operations was not affected.</p>\n<p><em>Corrections: An earlier version of this label erroneously reported that a policy to not use the words “terrorist” or “terrorism” to describe specific events has been in place since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The policy has been in effect at least since 1992.</em></p>\n<p><em>Disclosure: NewsGuard Editorial Director Eric Effron previously worked at Reuters as editor in charge of business and legal
