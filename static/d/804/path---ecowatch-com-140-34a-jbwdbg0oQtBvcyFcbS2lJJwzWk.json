The majority owners of EcoWatch Holdings are financial executives Thomas O’Sullivan, Theodore Janulis and Kerry Waterson. The site carries advertisements. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Ecowatch.com mainly focuses on stories about climate change and the environment. The site’s About Us page says Ecowatch is “leading the charge in using online news in the U.S. to drive fundamental change to ensure the health and longevity of our planet.”</p>\n<p>Typical topics include severe weather which may have been exacerbated by climate change, such as the 2018 California wildfires, deforestation and beach erosion. The site’s topics sections include Climate, Oceans, Energy, Food, Science, Animals, Politics, Business and Insights/Opinion.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of the content comes directly from advocacy groups, such as the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, the Center for American Progress, and the Organic Consumers Association.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Ecowatch.com articles published in 2018 tend to use straightforward headlines and reference reliable news organizations such as USA Today, The New York Times, and The Economist. The site’s managing editor, Tara Bracco, told NewsGuard in an email that it is staffed by “a very small team, mostly of part-time freelancers.” </p>\n<p>However, the site has published multiple articles over the past two years that promote unfounded claims about the safety of vaccines, some of which were removed by EcoWatch after NewsGuard pointed them out. Articles that EcoWatch removed in November 2018 include an story that falsely stated that expectant mothers who get flu shots during the first trimester of their pregnancy are more likely to have autistic children, as well as several articles that claimed vaccine ingredients such as thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative, led to the development of the disorder.</p>\n<p>A frequent contributor until May 2017 was Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former EcoWatch board member, who has repeatedly claimed vaccines can cause a variety of health conditions. His EcoWatch articles misrepresented the findings of published research to support his views. </p>\n<p>Bracco said she was unaware of the Kennedy articles until she was contacted by NewsGuard, and EcoWatch removed several of the stories from the site in November 2018. Because of the removal of the stories and a leadership change at Ecowatch.com in 2018, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not repeatedly publish false content.</p>\n<p>However, because some stories that are still on the site are misleading and promote unsubstantiated research, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not gather and present information responsibly, and does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>For example, a November 2017 article headlined “Top 17 Health Problems That Improved in People Who Switched From GMO to Organic Diets” made claims such as “the process of genetic modification itself damages DNA, which can add allergens, toxins and anti-nutrients to food.” The World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, the National Academy of Sciences, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science have all released statements saying there is no evidence that GMOs, which are food items produced from plants or animals whose DNA has been altered, are unsafe.</p>\n<p>The Ecowatch.com article relied on a survey written by anti-GMO activist Jeffrey Smith of the Institute for Responsible Technology, which claimed people who cut out genetically modified foods from their diets saw improvements in areas like digestive health, mood, memory, and joint pain. The article failed to mention that the survey responses came from people within the institute’s email database who, as the full November 2017 study acknowledged, “may be biased towards attributing health improvements to the elimination of GMOs based on expectations.”</p>\n<p>Bracco said Ecowatch.com could not change this article because it was a repost from the website Alternet.org. “We have partnerships with other sites and we curate and select content to repost, and reposts are clearly marked,” she told NewsGuard in an email. “We are unable to edit or change a repost. But we do reserve the right to change a photo or title of a repost.” Bracco added that reposts “are clearly marked so it’s clear it’s not EcoWatch making the claims” and said the site will “continue to review our current partners to make sure they are consistent with our editorial standards.”</p>\n<p>In a separate Insights/Opinion section, where Bracco says contributors are encouraged to “have more of a voice,” some writers misstate the findings of research to promote an environmentalist perspective. For example, a November 2018 article titled “5 Tips to Protect Kids From Cellphone Radiation During Holiday Travel,” argues that a 2018 study from the National Toxicology Program that found that high levels of cell phone radiation caused cancerous heart tumors in rats was applicable to humans: “This study offers valuable insight into the potential risk to people, including future exposure to 5G wireless networks,” the study said. Study author and National Toxicology Program senior scientist John Burcher said otherwise in a press release when the research was published. “The exposures used in the studies cannot be compared directly to the exposure that humans experience when using a cell phone,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>Bracco responded to NewsGuard, “With limited resources and a small team, we address any issues with older material once aware of a potential problem. We then have a team member here review and make a recommendation that is evaluated and approved by at least two other team members.”</p>\n<p>Although the site does not have a posted corrections policy, it has issued corrections to address factual errors in articles posted in 2018.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Authors are identified on stories written by EcoWatch’s staff, containing bylines that link to short biographies. For those written by advocacy groups, the group’s name appears in the byline, and the individual writer is generally identified at the top of the article. Some older stories are attributed only to “EcoWatch Contributor.” Bracco told NewsGuard that the site has ended the practice of publishing stories that do not credit a specific author.</p>\n<p>The site’s About page identifies its top editors and staff, with photos and biographies. The page does not list individual contact information, but general email addresses are included on the site’s Contact page.  </p>\n<p>The About page lists majority owners Thomas O’Sullivan, Theodore Janulis and Kerry Waterson as the site’s board members. In November 2018, the site added a clear ownership disclosure below their biographies that states, “The Board members collectively are the majority owners of EcoWatch.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>EcoWatch was founded as the nonprofit organization EarthWatch Ohio in October 2005 by Stefanie Spear, an environmental activist. Spear has also served as an advisor to environmental groups like GreenCityBlueLake, a group advocating for sustainable development in Northeast Ohio run by the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.</p>\n<p>The site changed its name to EcoWatch in 2009. In 2011, the site discontinued its bimonthly print newspaper, EcoWatch Journal, and relaunched as a “nationwide news service” in partnership with Kennedy’s Waterkeeper Alliance, according to an October 2011 press release.</p>\n<p>According to Bracco, current board members Janulis, O’Sullivan and Watterson have together represented a majority of the company’s ownership since its incorporation as a for-profit company in 2013.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This label has been updated, and its rating has been changed, after a further review of content on Ecowatch.com, additional discussions with the site’s managing editor, and after receiving new information about the site’s owners.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label reported erroneously that the site’s ownership changed in 2018. The site’s majority owners have been in place since 2013.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJohn Gregory\n\nEdited by:\nSarah Brandt&#x26;emsp;Amy
