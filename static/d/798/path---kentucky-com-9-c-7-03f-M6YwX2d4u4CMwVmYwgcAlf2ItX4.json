It also operates McClatchy DC, a news agency based in Washington that provides political coverage to McClatchy’s newspapers. McClatchy generates the bulk of its revenue from subscriptions and advertising for its printed and digital products.</p>\n<p>The site runs advertisements and also derives subscription revenue from readers who want unlimited access.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Kentucky.com features news articles about Lexington, Kentucky’s second-largest city, and also serves 70 counties in Central, Eastern, and South-Central Kentucky. The website prominently features the Herald-Leader’s coverage of University of Kentucky athletics. The Herald-Leader’s bureau in Frankfort, Kentucky, also contributes original reporting. The site publishes national content from the McClatchy Washington bureau, other McClatchy newspapers, and The Associated Press. </p>\n<p>Kentucky.com<em> </em>includes searchable databases of public information, including government employee salaries. Through a partnership with the Fayette County Sheriff’s Office, the site includes a weekly photo gallery of mugshots of fugitives, called Lexington’s Most Wanted. The site also publishes information on local activities and events in Lexington, under the title Lexington Things To Do.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Kentucky.com features original reporting with attributed sources, along with originally-produced videos and images that match text stories. Headlines accurately reflect articles. The site does not detail a formal corrections policy, but it regularly publishes corrections to its own articles, as well as separate corrections to Associated Press stories. Readers can submit corrections through a contact portal.</p>\n<p>The Herald-Leader has won three Pulitzer Prizes, most recently in 2000 for editorial cartooning.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Kentucky.com notes that the site is owned by McClatchy. Kentucky.com’s Contact Us page includes a list of reporters and editors, along with their contact information. The site’s About Us page lists the names and titles of its management team.</p>\n<p>Sponsored links are labeled and advertisements are differentiated from editorial content. After an earlier version of this label was published, McClatchy sites, including Kentucky.com, started labeling articles provided by content recommendation firm ZergNet with a “FROM OUR ADVERTISING PARTNERS” heading.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site publishes content of a news organization that represents two former Kentucky newspapers: The Lexington Herald, which launched in 1870, and the Lexington Leader, founded in 1888. They merged in 1983. Kentucky.com launched in 1999.</p>\n<p><em>Editor's Note: This Nutrition Label has been updated, and its rating has changed, after McClatchy sites began labeling paid content hosted by content recommendation firm ZergNet. The site now meets NewsGuard’s standard for labeling advertising.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSam Howard\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://smileypete.com/business/2012-03-02-herald-leader-makes-deep-cuts-and-loses-its-editor/\" target=\"_blank\">http://smileypete.com/business/2012-03-02-herald-leader-makes-deep-cuts-and-loses-its-editor/</a></li>\n<li>kentucky.com</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mcclatchy.com/our-impact/markets\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mcclatchy.com/our-impact/markets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://smileypete.com/business/2012-03-02-baniak-named-herald-leader-editor/\" target=\"_blank\">http://smileypete.com/business/2012-03-02-baniak-named-herald-leader-editor/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://investors.mcclatchy.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=87841&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1047643\" target=\"_blank\">http://investors.mcclatchy.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=87841&#x26;p=irol-newsArticle&#x26;ID=1047643</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19990422035210/http://www.kentucky.com:80/\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.archive.org/web/19990422035210/http://www.kentucky.com:80/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20000229171545/http://www.kentucky.com:80/rc/support/about.htm\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.archive.org/web/20000229171545/http://www.kentucky.com:80/rc/support/about.htm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20021012050458/http://www.kentucky.com:80/mld/kentucky/\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.archive.org/web/20021012050458/http://www.kentucky.com:80/mld/kentucky/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20010924181241/http://kentucky.com:80/\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.archive.org/web/20010924181241/http://kentucky.com:80/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"kentucky.com","author":"Sam Howard","date":"2019-02-25T18:24:36.372+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/kentucky.com/"}}
