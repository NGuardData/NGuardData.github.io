Lee Enterprises newspapers generate revenue from advertising and subscriptions to their printed and digital editions. Azdailysun.com has a subscription paywall.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Azdailysun.com covers breaking news, crime, education, business and the environment. Crime coverage includes a listing of sex offender notifications required of police departments by state law.</p>\n<p>The site frequently follows up to examine the impact of news stories. For example, after Flagstaff voters declined to decrease the city’s minimum wage to match a lower state minimum wage, the paper explored how businesses would deal with the higher costs. In another story, the paper looked at the economic effect of closing Coconino National Forest due to wildfire threats during the tourist season in late spring 2018. </p>\n<p>Articles from the Arizona Daily Sun and Flag Live!, a weekly arts and entertainment publication, are posted on azdailysun.com, as are state and national stories from The Associated Press and other third-party content providers. The newspaper publishes six days a week, excluding Mondays, while the website is updated daily.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Azdailysun.com quotes reliable sources, such as police, government officials, people with firsthand knowledge of events, and subject experts. Although the website does not post a corrections policy, it corrects factual errors, and adds an editor’s note explaining the mistake.</p>\n<p>The site clearly distinguishes between news and opinion, with a separate section for editorials, letters to the editor, and commentary. Headlines on azdailysun.com accurately reflect the content of articles.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The website discloses its ownership by Lee Enterprises, along with a corporate history. Staff-written articles include the names of authors, and the names, titles, email addresses, and phone numbers for reporters, editors, and managers are included on the Contact Us page.</p>\n<p>Advertising and sponsored content are distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Arizona Daily Sun started publishing in 1883 as a weekly newspaper under the name Coconino Sun. In 1946, the paper began to publish daily and changed its name to the Arizona Daily Sun.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nLillian Childress\n\nEdited by:\nPeggy Ackermann&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://lee.net/about/\" target=\"_blank\">http://lee.net/about/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://azdailysun.com/news/flagstaff-economy-thrives-despite-forest-closures/article_2d9dcbd9-a9b9-5d21-9285-74cc0163a1ae.html#tracking-source=home-top-story\" target=\"_blank\">https://azdailysun.com/news/flagstaff-economy-thrives-despite-forest-closures/article_2d9dcbd9-a9b9-5d21-9285-74cc0163a1ae.html#tracking-source=home-top-story</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://azdailysun.com/news/flagstaff-businesses-ponder-the-future-after-fails/article_6f86e67f-3b3c-506f-a241-52d1a414aca2.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://azdailysun.com/news/flagstaff-businesses-ponder-the-future-after-fails/article_6f86e67f-3b3c-506f-a241-52d1a414aca2.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://azdailysun.com/sports/local/nau-seeks-fifth-straight-wac-swim-and-dive-title/article_ab7b01db-abc7-5b2b-b4cb-d7d1cdc1656e.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://azdailysun.com/sports/local/nau-seeks-fifth-straight-wac-swim-and-dive-title/article_ab7b01db-abc7-5b2b-b4cb-d7d1cdc1656e.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://azdailysun.com/sports/local/influx-of-new-players-leaves-nau-defensive-line-as-a/article_94d6ed3a-31f7-577c-afe3-626a3ed46c7e.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://azdailysun.com/sports/local/influx-of-new-players-leaves-nau-defensive-line-as-a/article_94d6ed3a-31f7-577c-afe3-626a3ed46c7e.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://azdailysun.com/news/local/the-fewsion-project-finding-a-way-for-flagstaff-s-food/article_2ab7abf2-aa8e-5482-b183-65f7a0b46e79.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://azdailysun.com/news/local/the-fewsion-project-finding-a-way-for-flagstaff-s-food/article_2ab7abf2-aa8e-5482-b183-65f7a0b46e79.html</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://azdailysun.com/opinion/#tracking-source=menu-nav\" target=\"_blank\">https://azdailysun.com/opinion/#tracking-source=menu-nav</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://azdailysun.com/contact/staff/\" target=\"_blank\">https://azdailysun.com/contact/staff/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://azdailysun.com/contact-us/\" target=\"_blank\">https://azdailysun.com/contact-us/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://azdailysun.com/info/flagstaff-publishing---arizona-daily-sun---about/article_28f08034-b026-11e1-b398-001a4bcf887a.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://azdailysun.com/info/flagstaff-publishing---arizona-daily-sun---about/article_28f08034-b026-11e1-b398-001a4bcf887a.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://azdailysun.com/info/flagstaff-publishing---arizona-daily-sun---about/article_28f08034-b026-11e1-b398-001a4bcf887a.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://azdailysun.com/info/flagstaff-publishing---arizona-daily-sun---about/article_28f08034-b026-11e1-b398-001a4bcf887a.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"azdailysun.com","author":"Lillian Childress","date":"2018-12-12T17:24:03.162+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/azdailysun.com/"}}
