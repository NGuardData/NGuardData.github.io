William Allman, chief digital officer for Smithsonian Enterprises, the revenue-generating arm of the Smithsonian, manages the website and other digital efforts. Allman began his career as a journalist on Science 80, published by the  American Association for the Advancement of Science, and moved to U.S. News &#x26; World Report as a senior writer and editor specializing in science, technology, and health. The site is supported by advertising and magazine memberships.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The website contains a mix of original web-only stories plus articles from the magazine. Brian Wolly, digital editor of Smithsonian.com, said in an email the site publishes 40-50 stories per week, plus 20 or so articles per month from the print edition. The website covers a broad range of topics including history, nature, hard science, travel, and innovation. A recent edition contained a cultural analysis of Mad Magazine and the late Stephen Hawking’s exhortation to humans to leave earth for new planets. Articles are well-written and lushly illustrated.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles are sourced to leading researchers, and headlines match the content of articles.</p>\n<p>Corrections are run with notes from the editor explaining what was corrected in the article.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Editorial staff are listed on the site, and links are provided with contact information to reach writers. Advertising is clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The website has been around in various iterations since the early 2000s, editor Wolly said, but it began in earnest as a magazine site in 2006.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nHoward Wolinsky\n\nEdited by:\nJim Warren&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.smithsonianmag.com/</a></li>\n<li>Email exchange with Brian Wolly, digital editor</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"smithsonianmag.com","author":"Howard Wolinsky","date":"2018-07-20T14:06:05.206+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/smithsonianmag.com/"}}
