Belo Corporation, a publicly traded media company based in Dallas, owns Dallas News and operates it through a subsidiary, the Belo Media Group. Belo Media Group operates affiliated sports and entertainment sites called Sports Day and Guide Live. Revenues come from advertising and subscription fees paid by readers.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Dallas News’ original reporting extensively covers North Texas politics, business, real estate, crime, retail, weather, and other news. The website also publishes content from several news services, including The New York Times, Bloomberg and Associated Press. Following changes introduced by editor in chief Mike Wilson and other senior editors in 2015, Dallas News became more of a digital-first outlet, working to publish more breaking news online.</p>\n<p>Readers can also access the Dallas Morning News Store, which sells back copies and reprints, sports memorabilia, photo reprints, and print and digital newspaper subscriptions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Headlines on Dallas News are straightforward and reflect the articles’ substance. Articles include first-hand interviews and link to external sources and other Morning News articles when relevant. Photos and social media posts are often embedded within stories. </p>\n<p>In its opinion section, which is separate from reported news, the site publishes letters to the editor, opinion, commentary, and editorials. A March 2018 editorial titled “Meet the Dallas Morning News editorial board” published profiles of, and contact information for, the nine-person board. </p>\n<p>Both the print newspaper and the website issue corrections and clarifications to stories that contain errors. The site’s Contact Us page includes a link to a detailed form readers can fill out to submit corrections or clarifications.</p>\n<p>The Dallas Morning News has won nine Pulitzer Prizes, most recently in 2010 for editorial writing that explored an economic divide in the city, and in 2006 for breaking news photography that documented the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.</p>\n<p>The Morning News’ original office -- the newspaper moved from it in 2017 --  was known for its “Rock of Truth” facade, a three-story stone slab displaying a quote from its first publisher: “Build the news upon the rock of truth and righteousness. Conduct it always upon the lines of fairness and integrity. Acknowledge the right of the people to get from the newspaper both sides of every important question.” A Rock of Truth replica is on display at the entrance of its new newsroom. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Dallas News publishes biographical information and email addresses for its reporters and editors, which can be found by clicking on their bylines. Newsroom leaders are identified on the Contact Us page, which lists individual phone numbers and email addresses as well as phone numbers for various departments at the paper, including local news, the editorial board, and the sports desk. </p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored stories are clearly distinguished on the site.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Dallas Morning News was initially developed in 1885 as a satellite paper for The Galveston News in Texas, but quickly became the more prominent news outlet of the two. Today, it is the only remaining English-language daily newspaper in Dallas. The website launched in 1996.</p>\n<p>In the 2016 presidential election, the paper’s editorial board endorsed Hillary Clinton. She was the first Democratic candidate for that race endorsed by the paper in over 75 years.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This Nutrition Label and the criteria checklist have been updated to reflect the fact that DallasNews.com now discloses information about its newsroom leaders on its Contact Us page.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nKendrick McDonald\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.guidelive.com/about-us\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.guidelive.com/about-us</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171031005961/en/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171031005961/en/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bushcenter.org/publications/articles/2018/02/why-we-need-to-know-the-difference-between-fake-news-and-real-news.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bushcenter.org/publications/articles/2018/02/why-we-need-to-know-the-difference-between-fake-news-and-real-news.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.dallasnews.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.belomediagroup.com/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.belomediagroup.com/about-us/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ahbelo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.ahbelo.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2017/the-move/\" target=\"_blank\">https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2017/the-move/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/news/dallas-morning-news-becoming-truly-digital-means-starting-over\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.poynter.org/news/dallas-morning-news-becoming-truly-digital-means-starting-over</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/taro/smu/00107/00107-P.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/taro/smu/00107/00107-P.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://texashistory.unt.edu/explore/collections/DSDHD/\" target=\"_blank\">https://texashistory.unt.edu/explore/collections/DSDHD/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/business/the-dallas-morning-news/2018/03/01/grant-moise-become-8th-publisher-dallas-morning-news\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.dallasnews.com/business/the-dallas-morning-news/2018/03/01/grant-moise-become-8th-publisher-dallas-morning-news</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/contact-us\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.dallasnews.com/contact-us</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://store.dallasnews.com/#_ga=2.218863705.1399909583.1532617196-66167452.1473986772\" target=\"_blank\">http://store.dallasnews.com/#_ga=2.218863705.1399909583.1532617196-66167452.1473986772</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/opinion/2018/03/27/meet-the-dallas-morning-news-editorial-board\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/opinion/2018/03/27/meet-the-dallas-morning-news-editorial-board</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/news/dallas-morning-news-iconic-rock-truth-monument-made-move-across-town-sort\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.poynter.org/news/dallas-morning-news-iconic-rock-truth-monument-made-move-across-town-sort</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2017/the-move/\" target=\"_blank\">https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2017/the-move/ </a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"dallasnews.com","author":"Kendrick McDonald","date":"2018-10-09T21:17:32.195+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/dallasnews.com/"}}
