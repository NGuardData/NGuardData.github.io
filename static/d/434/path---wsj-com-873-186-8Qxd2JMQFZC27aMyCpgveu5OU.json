News Corp also owns Barron’s, MarketWatch, The New York Post, and other media entities. Murdoch also owns 21st Century Fox. In addition to its print and digital editions, The Wall Street Journal hosts conferences for business leaders. The site is financed through advertisements, subscriptions, and sales of the publication’s other products, according to News Corp’s annual report. Much of the site’s content is only accessible to paid subscribers.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site publishes articles and videos with original reporting covering international politics and financial markets, technology, lifestyle, and the arts. It also contains an opinions section featuring regular columnists, reviews, and other editorials. Its opinion section, particularly the editorial page, has long been known for its conservative posture, summed up by its principle “free markets and free people” — a point of view that is not evident on its news pages. The Journal has long had a big impact on financial markets, with features such as the popular “Heard on the Street” columns that have caused stock prices to rise and fall. WSJ.com also offers articles on lifestyle, fashion, travel, and the arts. The Wall Street Journal operates Asian and European editions in addition to its U.S. edition. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal has a history of more than 100 years of credible reporting, with bureaus worldwide. Articles are thoroughly sourced, featuring original interviews and outside research and reporting. The site contains a section in which it publishes corrections, and articles that have been updated are appended with a description of the correction at the bottom. The Wall Street Journal has won 37 Pulitzer Prizes, most recently receiving a Pulitzer Prize for commentary for columnist Peggy Noonan’s coverage of the 2016 presidential election.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>WSJ.com discloses its ownership by Dow Jones &#x26; Company at the bottom of the site. A Contact section identifies its editors and contains email addresses for contacting different sections of the publication and for submitting feedback, corrections, and letters to the editor. Articles include the name of the writer with links to the author’s biography, social media accounts, and usually their email address. Advertisements and sponsored content are clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The first products of Dow Jones &#x26; Company were brief news items called “flimsies,” hand-delivered in New York City’s financial district. The company launched the The Wall Street Journal in 1889. Co-founder Charles H. Dow created the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The paper was aimed at the business community at a time when most newspapers focused on local or general news.</p>\n<p>Bernard Kilgore became managing editor of The Wall Street Journal in 1941 and ran the newspaper for 25 years, expanding the paper to provide coverage beyond business and finance. The Journal has published many consequential articles over the years, including Pulitzer Prize winning coverage of stock market crashes and insider trading scandals. In 1985, the Journal’s “Heard on the Street” columnist, R. Foster Winans, was convicted on insider trading charges, after he was found to have traded stocks based on what his column was about to report.</p>\n<p>The Journal established its online version in 1996 and was one of the first newspapers to charge for its online content. News Corp acquired the Journal’s publisher, Dow Jones, in 2007.</p>\n<p><em>Disclosure: </em><em>NewsGuard co-CEO Gordon Crovitz was formerly the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, a columnist for the publication, and the executive vice president of Dow Jones and president of its Consumer Media Group.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie
