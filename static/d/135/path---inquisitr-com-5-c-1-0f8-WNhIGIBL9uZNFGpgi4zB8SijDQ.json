Editor-in-chief and managing director Daniel Treisman, an Israeli businessman, is one of the site’s owners. Treisman bought the site in 2011 for $330,000 from founder and former TechCrunch blogger Duncan Riley. According to his LinkedIn profile, Treisman is also the founder and CEO of Dream Smoke, an e-cigarette company, and the chief executive of Guru Media International, a media company that seeks to “provide the ultimate platform for both advertiser campaigns and affiliate marketing partners,” according to its website.  </p>\n<p>Inquisitr runs display advertising and sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Inquisitr writers produce news stories with little, if any, original reporting. Instead, the site’s writers typically write about news originally reported by other news outlets. The site occasionally publishes original opinion pieces and marks them as such.</p>\n<p>Inquisitr writers cover a variety of topics, including entertainment, health and lifestyle, world news, technology, business and politics. The site’s front page, however, primarily features entertainment and celebrity coverage. The site sometimes posts stories with a “fact check” tag, in which it “debunks” stories that appeared on other outlets. However, those stories are typically coverage of debunking work done by other websites. For example, a June 2018 headline “No, Netflix Isn’t Releasing a ‘God Of War’ Series Next Month,” ran with a story that referenced a fake promotional poster for a non-existent Netflix series that was debunked by both fact-checking site Snopes and a Netflix fan site.  </p>\n<p>Inquisitr.com also employs “influencers,” who are paid to promote its content on social media platforms. Inquisitr discloses this program, but not its members, on its website.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Inquistr.com writers cite and link to sources within articles. Headlines are generally accurate and properly label the accompanying story. However, headlines are occasionally misleading. For example, a May 2018 headline, “Robert Mueller Hints Probe Could End September 1 Pending Donald Trump’s Cooperation” did not accurately reflect the article’s content. According to the article, President Trump’s attorney, Rudy Giuliani claimed he was told by Mueller’s team that the special counsel’s investigation could end by September 1. However, the headline falsely implied that Mueller himself had spoken publicly about a deadline.</p>\n<p>Inquisitr.com has published stories containing unverified information that turned out to be fabricated. In 2015, the site published a story about a Florida man turning himself in to the police for murdering his imaginary friend. The original story was published on a site called Moron.com and was written by an author identified as “Moron.” The story was soon exposed as fake by fact-checking site Snopes.com. Inquisitr eventually took down the story and did not publish a correction. </p>\n<p>The site retracted an article in 2015 on a customer complaining that a Costco birthday cake she ordered online had “666” written on it in icing, after learning that the customer was the girlfriend of the story’s author, and that several details in the story were false, including that the cake could be ordered online. It published a statement on the story saying, “A thorough review of the facts found it does not meet the Inquisitr’s standards on multiple fronts, including accuracy and disclosure.”</p>\n<p>In 2017, Inquisitr.com, along with several other sites, including Fox News and the Daily Mail, published a story about a married couple discovering they were twins through genetic testing. Fact-checking site Snopes.com pointed out that the original report Inquisitr.com and others had used as a basis for their stories was from a website called MississippiHerald.com, which did not provide details about the couple, the clinic in question, or the medical professionals involved. Inquisitr later updated its story to note it had been debunked.</p>\n<p>Inquisitr runs corrections. It has also taken down stories and replaced them with editor’s notes explaining why the story was taken down.</p>\n<p>In May 2018, Inquisitr hired Dominic Miserandino as CEO. Miserandino is the founder and former executive editor of CelebrityCafe.com and was a former president of the Press Club of Long Island. Miserandino told NewsGuard on the phone that he was seeking to improve the site’s editorial safeguards, but he did not respond to two emails, a voicemail and a message sent through the site’s Contact Us portal asking specifically about what changes he has implemented.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Article bylines include links to an author page with biographical information and links to authors’ social media profiles. However, the site does not provide links to the authors’ emails. It also does not provide contact or biographical information about the site’s editors or management. It does provide a general email address for the site’s editors and a phone number. </p>\n<p>Inquisitr describes on its About page a system for vetting its freelance journalists who contribute stories. It doesn’t specify if all of its content is produced by contributors, but says their work is evaluated and graded, and audited regularly.</p>\n<p>The site does not lists its editors or management. Inquistir did not respond to two emails, a voicemail, and a message sent through the site’ asking about the site’s disclosure of its leadership.</p>\n<p>Inquisitr.com labels sponsored and promoted
