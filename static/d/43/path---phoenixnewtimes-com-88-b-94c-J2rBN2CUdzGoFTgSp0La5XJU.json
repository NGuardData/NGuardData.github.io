The homepage includes as events calendar, Things to do in Phoenix. A Best of Phoenix section gives out out annual awards to local businesses and organizations. There are also sections devoted to longform journalism and to news about marijuana.</p>\n<p>The News section has a page devoted to the controversial former sheriff of Maricopa County, Joe Arpaio, who was pardoned by President Trump after he disobeyed a court order to stop racially profiling Hispanics. Over the last two decades, the paper has reported extensively on Arpaio’s polarizing tactics, from the outdoor jails he ran to the millions of dollars his office paid out in wrongful death lawsuits.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Most of the site’s content is original reporting and reviews. The site’s writers seek comment from subjects of stories and use primary sources and documents. Headlines accurately represent the content of articles. The site runs corrections at the bottom of stories as needed.</p>\n<p>In 2018, New Times reporters Antonia Noori Farzan and Joseph Flaherty won a Polk Award for revealing that Motel 6 in Phoenix provided lists of guests to ICE agents investigating undocumented immigrants. </p>\n<p>The site does not typically publish opinions or editorialize in its news stories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Author names are published with stories. Brief biographies of reporters appear at the bottom of stories, which contain links to a contact form and social media profiles. The site lists its employees and contributors on a Staff page. An About Us page discloses the site’s ownership by Voice Media Group.</p>\n<p>The site differentiates between advertising and editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The New Times was founded in 1970 by Arizona State University students as an alternative to the largest paper in the state, Phoenix-based Arizona Republic, which they believed to be too conservative. The founders sold the publication to Voice Media in 2012.</p>\n<p>In 2007, two of the paper’s founders, Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin, were jailed by Arpaio after allegedly publishing grand jury details related to a dispute between Arpaio and the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office. Charges were later dropped and Maricopa County eventually paid a $3.75 million settlement to the journalists after they filed suit over the arrests.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBen
