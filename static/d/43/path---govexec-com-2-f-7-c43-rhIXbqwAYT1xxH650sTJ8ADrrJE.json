The site also runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Government Executive states that its “essential editorial mission is to cover the business of the federal government and its huge departments and agencies -- dozens of which dwarf the largest institutions in the private sector.” The site explains that it aims to serve “the high-ranking civilian and military officials who are responsible for defending the nation and carrying out the laws that define the government's role in our economy and society.”</p>\n<p>GovExec.com’ news section covers breaking news in the federal government, such as changes in Cabinet positions, military maneuvers, and news events that could require federal intervention, such as hurricanes. It has several other sections with more explanatory and analysis pieces on managing federal agencies and federal employee salaries. Other content sections include Management, Oversight, Defense, and Pay &#x26; Benefits. On a typical day, stories might cover topics such as “Behind the Trump Administration's 'Brutal' Decision to Remove Its Federal Personnel Chief,” “Judges’ Union: Supreme Court Decision an ‘Excuse’ to Politicize AJLs,” and “FBI Internal Survey Shows Morale Was Higher Before Comey was Fired.”</p>\n<p>The site also hosts articles from other Atlantic Media publications.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Government Executive employs a staff to carry out original, firsthand, and often in-depth reporting. Some articles draw predominantly from third party sources, which are linked. Headlines accurately reflect their stories. Images and sources used in Government Executive (and hosted Atlantic Media) articles are consistently attributed.</p>\n<p>Some stories articulate clear points of view, but are written from a balanced perspective and are backed up by public officials’ comments. For example, the October 2018 story “How Attempts at Fixing the Civil Service System Have Made It Worse” quotes the analysis of several federal human resource officials interviewed about the problem. Some opinion columns are published in a section called Voices.</p>\n<p>The site does not have a stated corrections policy and does not appear to regularly publish corrections. The site did not respond to two NewsGuard messages sent through the site’s contact form about its corrections policy and mixing of news and opinion.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>All articles on Government Executive name their authors, which link to biographical and social media information. The site features a staff page listing Government Executive’s employees, which also link to biographical or social media details for its leadership.</p>\n<p>The website clearly labels its sponsored content and explains where relevant that “This content is made possible by our sponsor. The editorial staff of Govexec was not involved in its preparation.” Advertisements are also distinguished from news content.</p>\n<p>Government Executive makes clear that it is owned by Atlantic Media and features links to the websites of other Atlantic Media outlets at the bottom of each page.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Government Executive was founded as a print magazine in 1969, and later moved from a monthly to a bimonthly publication. The website launched in 1996 Government Executive stopped publishing in print at the end of 2015.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBron Maher\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ownership</li>\n<li>“Launched as a print magazine in 1969 and as a digital publication in 1996, it is produced by Atlantic Media’s Government Executive Media Group.
