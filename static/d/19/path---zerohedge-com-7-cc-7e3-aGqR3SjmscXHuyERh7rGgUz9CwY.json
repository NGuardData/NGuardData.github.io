The site’s copyright lists a company called ABC Media LTD as its owner. According to a 2012 court document, a search for Zero Hedge in a domain registry database revealed that ABC Media LTD was based in Bulgaria.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard asked Zero Hedge via a general email address about its relationship to ABC Media LTD, and was told that the site is “100% employee owned and has never received outside funding.” According to a November 2016 post on the site, Zero Hedge’s revenue comes exclusively from advertising and donations from readers. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site publishes a mixture of original and aggregated reporting and commentary on global financial and political news. Articles are often densely written, featuring charts, photographs, and numerical calculations. The stories most often carry the byline “Tyler Durden,” with a graphic illustration of “Durden,” who is a character in the book and film, “Fight Club.” Stories often begin with a one- or two-paragraph introduction with commentary, and then republish news from largely credible sources, including The Associated Press and Reuters news services, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and political sites like The Hill. Other stories insert quote blocks from the other news outlets and include longer analyses. </p>\n<p>Shortly after it was founded in 2009, the blog featured lengthy analyses of financial institutions, often focused on the idea that Wall Street had many secrets and would soon come crashing down. A September 2009 New York Magazine<em> </em>report said the posts “had the feel of a financial insider leaking forbidden information.” </p>\n<p>Articles on Zero Hedge, which has stated that it refuses “to follow the pro-US script,” are often conspiratorial or pro-Kremlin in nature, which has prompted speculation that the site is a Russian propaganda initiative. A NewsGuard review found many stories on the site with a pro-Russia slant, such as an April 2018 story headlined “Russia Claims Skripal Poisoning Was Staged By UK Intelligence.” Sergei Skripal is a former member of the Russian military who had served as a double agent for the British government and was poisoned with a nerve agent in March 2018 in the United Kingdom. </p>\n<p>The Zero Hedge story supported the Kremlin’s stance on Skripal, implying that the U.K. and the U.S., not Russia, were responsible for the attack. It included a video from RT, a news outlet financed by the Russian government, posing a similar argument.</p>\n<p>Zero Hedge also republishes op-eds from RT that espouse pro-Russian views, such as a March 2018 piece headlined “Global Anti-Russia Campaign Is Taking Us Dangerously Close To Disaster.” Ivandjiiski has denied any ties with the Russian government. Zero Hedge did not respond to an email from NewsGuard asking about the site’s connection to Russia.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Zero Hedge has been cited multiple times over the past two years for publishing false content by independent fact-checking websites, including Snopes and Politifact, and has been judged by NewsGuard to repeatedly publish false content.</p>\n<p>In July 2017, Zero Hedge published a false story headlined “Haiti Official Who Exposed The Clinton Foundation Is Found Dead.” The story was republished from a right-leaning blog SHTFplan.com, which often posts alarmist reports. The July 2017 piece reported that Klaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official who committed suicide that month, “was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week.” The story included a statement attributed to Eberwein about the Clinton Foundation, referring to them as “criminals...thieves…liars,” and implied that this criticism made him a target of the foundation.</p>\n<p>Haitian activist Dahoud Andre, not Eberwein, actually made this statement. Andre had protested outside the New York offices of the Clinton Foundation over Bill Clinton’s work as co-chair of the United Nations-affiliated Interim Haiti Recovery Commission following the devastating Haiti earthquake in 2010. The slow pace of the recovery process overseen by the commission frustrated many Haitians and several stories, without evidence, blamed the Clinton Foundation. </p>\n<p>The Clinton Foundation never controlled any of the foreign aid funds managed by the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission, although the Zero Hedge story conflated the two, incorrectly attributing United Nations statistics about the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission’s allocation of funds to Eberwein. Neither Snopes nor NewsGuard found any substantiated link between Eberwein’s death and the Clinton Foundation. Zero Hedge did not respond to an email from NewsGuard asking for comment on this story.</p>\n<p>Snopes debunked a Zero Hedge story from November 2016, published a few days after the presidential election, that falsely reported that anti-Trump protesters were paid to protest and had been bused to Chicago. The story offered no proof that protesters were “professional [and] paid” other than a video “courtesy of a Zero Hedge reader.” The video depicted a group of buses that allegedly contained the paid protesters, but did not show that the vehicles were related to anti-Trump protests in any way. Zero Hedge did not respond to an email from NewsGuard asking for comment on this story.</p>\n<p>Another story flagged as false, also originating from the SHTFplan.com site, incorrectly claimed that police seized a man’s gun without a warrant in Seattle. NewsGuard confirmed that the seizure described in the March 2018 story, “Seattle Police Begin Gun Confiscations: No Laws Broken, No Warrant, No Charges,” occurred under the state’s “red flag law,” which prohibits an individual from having access to firearms for a certain period if a court decides that that person is a significant threat. Under that law, the police had obtained a warrant from a judge. Politifact flagged the story as false.</p>\n<p>SHTFplan.com updated its story with an editor’s note acknowledging the police did have a warrant. Zero Hedge did not update its version of the story.</p>\n<p>In response to an inquiry about the content it draws some of its reports from, an unnamed Zero Hedge spokesperson replied that the site “hyperlinks to all data sources, which for 98% of articles, are Bloomberg, Reuters, AP, or wire services.” The spokesperson, who corresponded with NewsGuard from an email address for “Tyler Durden,” did not respond to an email inquiry asking to identify himself. </p>\n<p>The Zero Hedge spokesperson who communicated from the Tyler Durden alias told NewsGuard about its policy for corrections: “Zero Hedge corrects articles, in both content and style, if and when we find errors. We do not make formal correction announcements.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site’s mission statement highlights “the critical importance of anonymity and its role in dissident speech.” In a 2016 Bloomberg story, former Zero Hedge employee Colin Lokey alleged that “Durden” was three individuals: himself, Ivandjiiski, and a current financial industry member.</p>\n<p>The site fails to provide information about the identity of “Durden,” but bylines for other contributors sometimes link to profiles that include their names along with personal websites or contact information. The company that owns the site is not disclosed.</p>\n<p>Some articles are labeled as a “Sponsored Post,” although other stories that do not have that label are produced by sites that sell various financial services. For example, stories by “Phoenix Capital Research,” a company that publishes investment research, are attributed to its chief market strategist and contain promotional material for the company at the bottom of the article. This content is not labeled as advertising, although it promotes the businesses that produce it, which is why NewsGuard determined that the site does not clearly identify advertising.</p>\n<p>The unnamed representative writing from the Tyler Durden alias said the site “publishes outside content from content contributors. It does not receive any compensation from such contributors, unless an article is explicitly noted as a ‘sponsored post.’’’</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Zero Hedge was founded by Ivandjiiski in January 2009. It caught the attention of the mainstream media with its reporting on high-frequency computer trading at Goldman Sachs in the spring of 2009, alleging that this method allowed the firm to see trading movements just before they were carried out and accounted for its huge profits so soon after the 2008 economic crisis. The SEC proposed a ban on so-called “flash trading” in September of that year. </p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this label misspelled the name of Haitian activist Dahoud Andre.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nNina Zweig\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
