It is funded almost entirely by donations, although the site also runs some ads. ProPublica is not legally bound to disclose its donors as a nonprofit. But on its website, it publishes its tax returns, which list all donors that donated over $5,000, along with the donated amounts. </p>\n<p>The largest donations in 2017 were a $7.5 million contribution from the Ford Foundation, a $3 million gift from a partnership between the anti-war Peace by Pieces Fund and Pew Charitable Trusts, and roughly $3 million each from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Democracy Fund, and Herb and Marion Sandler’s Sandler Foundation. </p>\n<p>The Sandlers, the largest donors to ProPublica since its launch, made a fortune selling their savings and loan company, Golden West Financial to Wachovia Bank in 2006. The Sandlers  were criticized for their role in the 2008 financial crisis after Wachovia Bank collapsed. The couple has funded liberal causes and contributed to groups aligned with the Democratic Party. Marion Sandler died in 2012.</p>\n<p>ProPublica also solicits donations from readers. It received donations from more than 34,000 people in 2017, with an average donation of $100, according to the site.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>ProPublica conducts and publishes deeply reported stories covering diverse topics including fracking, airport scanners, presidential pardons, mortgages, and political corruption, with an aim of spurring reform. For example, in August 2018, ProPublica published “The Shadow Rulers of the VA,” a nearly 4,000-word examination of three members of President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago country club who have exerted influence at the Department of Veterans Affairs, even though they do not work there. ProPublica also publishes stories on larger demographic and health trends. In late 2017, ProPublica published a story on the disparities between white and black women’s mortality rates during childbirth in the U.S..</p>\n<p>ProPublica publishes stories across a variety of mediums, in partnership with other outlets, including the New Yorker, NPR, 60 Minutes, the Washington Post, Politico, The Atlantic, and PBS. For example, ProPublica partnered with PBS’ Frontline to create a video series titled “Documenting Hate.” The first installment, “Documenting Hate: Charlottesville,” published in August 2018, examined the march and rally by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. </p>\n<p>The site also pays for local reporters to work on investigative projects through its Local Reporting Network. Projects funded through the network are published on ProPublica.org.</p>\n<p>ProPublica creates and maintains a variety of tools and databases that allow the public and other journalists to track politicians’ spending and corporate connections. Its Represent page enables users to search voting records, sponsored legislation, and press releases of individual members of Congress, as well as state delegations. It also allows users to look up bills and to see who voted for and against them. Represent also maintains a database of lobbying records, searchable by legislation, issue, individual lobbyist, lobbying firms, firm clients, and the lobbied government entity.</p>\n<p>The site’s NewsApp section has various other databases and tools, including Trump Town,  which contains the searchable records of thousands of Trump administration appointees by name, agency, former employers, and by whether they have obtained ethics waivers. ProPublica also maintains the Nonprofit Explorer, a searchable database of more than 3 million tax returns from tax-exempt organizations, and Dollars for Docs, a searchable database that lets visitors see if their doctors have received payments from drug or medical device companies. </p>\n<p>A Get Involved section seeks reader input on possible stories. In August 2018, the site ran such requests under the titles “Have You Donated or Helped to Collect Birth Tissue?” and “What Do You Know About Public Housing In the U.S.? Help Us Investigate.”</p>\n<p>ProPublica maintains a ProPublica Illinois site that reports on the state from a Chicago newsroom.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>ProPublica investigations have had a major impact both on policy and public discourse. In June 2018, for example, ProPublica published audio of children crying at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility after they had been separated from their families at the border. The audio caused a public outcry, and contributed to the bipartisan outrage that led the Trump administration to roll back its family separation policy.</p>\n<p>Since its founding in 2007, ProPublica has won four Pulitzer Prizes. The site shared the award with the New York Daily News in 2017 for public service for exposing a New York City Police Department practice of evicting residents from minority neighborhoods under the city’s “nuisance abatement” law. The series was followed by legislative changes that reformed the way police can enforce the nuisance laws. ProPublica won Pulitzers in 2016 for explanatory reporting, in 2011 for national reporting, and in 2010 for investigative reporting, the first time an online-only news outlet won the award. In 2018, ProPublica was a finalist in both the explanatory reporting and local reporting categories.</p>\n<p>ProPublica runs corrections, and links to a list of corrections on its homepage, which also has a notice telling readers where to send corrections.</p>\n<p>The site ran perhaps its most significant correction in March 2018, after President Donald Trump tapped longtime CIA veteran Gina Haspel to be the agency’s next director. ProPublica corrected a February 2017 story about Haspel that said she was in charge of a CIA “blacksite” in Thailand where suspected terrorist Abu Zubaydah was tortured in 2002. Haspel was not in charge of the site when Zubaydah was tortured. As part of its correction, ProPublica ran a nearly 1,000-word editor’s note at the top of the story and changed the story’s headline.</p>\n<p>Some conservative outlets have criticized ProPublica for having a liberal bias, citing its funding by the Sandlers and George Soros, who are supporters of liberal causes. A 2017 article in the Daily Caller, titled “Credibility Of Pulitzer Prize Takes A Hit By Rewarding Propublica’s Liberal Bias,” argued that “for all the hard-hitting investigations ProPublica reporters do, none of them has looked into the questionable financial history of Herbert and Marion Sandler.” The piece also argued that a journalism model based around donations was inherently flawed, writing “fundraising links are a tool for advocacy groups, not news organizations.”</p>\n<p>In 2017, White House press secretary Sean Spicer sought to dismiss a ProPublica report about changes made to President Trump’s trust by calling the site a “left-wing blog.”</p>\n<p>In 2018, a ProPublica story by three senior editors titled “Welcome to Our Second Decade” looked back on the site’s first 10 years of operations. The editors wrote that the site’s reporters “covered three administrations — two led by Republican presidents and one by a Democrat. We’ve had a testy relationship with every one of them, and that’s no surprise. Investigative reporting sets out to reveal what those in power most want to hide, their mistakes, misjudgments, and, sometimes, their corruption. We do so without regard to party affiliation or political outlook.”</p>\n<p>ProPublica has investigated the Trump administration on many fronts, and was also critical of the Obama administration. For example, in 2016 the site ran a story titled “Trying (and Trying) to get Records From the ‘Most Transparent Administration’ Ever” that pointed out Obama’s failure to live up to his promise of transparency. Requesting records under the Freedom of Information Act “has been a disaster under his watch,” ProPublica’s Justin Elliot wrote.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>ProPublica stories credit reporters, and include a short author biography, photograph, email, Twitter handle, and often a phone number at the bottom of stories. At the bottom of the home page, an Officers and Staff link brings readers to a page that lists all ProPublica staff, with links to biographical and contact information.</p>\n<p>The site lists its major donors, its board members and advisors, and the news outlets it has partnered with. ProPublica also publishes a code of ethics. Advertising is distinguished from news content.</p>\n<p>ProPublica President Richard Tofel told NewsGuard that ProPublica has a policy in place that ensures the newsroom’s independence from the board. Board members do not review stories prior to publication, he said. “They don’t know what we are working on. That’s the way we want it and they want it,” Tofel said.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>ProPublica began operations in 2008. A note explaining the launch of ProPublica published on the website in late 2007 explained the site’s purpose. “Investigative journalism is at risk. Many news organizations have increasingly come to see it as a luxury,” the note said. “This is therefore a moment when new models are necessary to carry forward some of the great work of journalism in the public interest that is such an integral part of self-government, and thus an important bulwark of our democracy.”</p>\n<p><em>Disclosure: NewsGuard co-CEO Gordon Crovitz is on ProPublica’s
