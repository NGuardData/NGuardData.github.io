Space.com derives revenue from advertisements and sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Space.com says its mission is “celebrating space exploration, innovation and discovery” by publishing articles, photos, and videos on space-related news. The site features sections titled News, Tech, Spaceflight, Science &#x26; Astronomy, Search for Life, Skywatching, and <br>Entertainment, as well as a Video section that links to a Space.com YouTube account.</p>\n<p>Articles written by Space.com staff and contributors are based on reporting and content published elsewhere, including SpaceNews, collectSPACE.com, and Live Science. The site features a space-related image of the day, skywatching guides, infographics explaining complex astronomy concepts, and topic-specific pages dedicated to dark matter, rocket launches, and the latest discoveries about Saturn.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles typically link to external sources of information and images. Space.com clearly distinguishes between news content and opinion pieces by publishing the latter in a section titled: “Expert Voices: Op-Ed and Insights.” The section features work by science experts, including astrophysicists and environmental science lecturers as well as science news site contributors. </p>\n<p>NewsGuard confirmed the site publishes corrections as needed. It has been cited as authoritative on space-related issues by Snopes, a fact-checking organization. Space.com was a Webby Award Honoree in the Science category in 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014. The Webby Awards are run by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Space.com’s About Us page lists biographical and contact information for its staff. It includes disclosure regarding relationships with the companies whose products it reviews. “Our review pages may contain traditional advertising and sponsorships, in addition to links which generate sales through an affiliate or lead generation relationship,” the site disclosed. However, content is not labeled as sponsored in the articles themselves. Space.com did not respond to an email and two voicemails seeking information about the labeling of its sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Space.com was founded on July 20, 1999, the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, by pundit and author Lou Dobbs, a founding anchor of CNN who started hosting a show on Fox Business Network in 2011. At its founding, Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, was the site’s president, and Neil Armstrong, the first human to set foot on the Moon, served on the board of directors.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJulia Press\n\nEdited by:\nJosh Keefe&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.space.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.space.com/about </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.purch.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.purch.com/about/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=30518536\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=30518536 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_de/4560993\" target=\"_blank\">https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_de/4560993</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/2000/07/05/feat.html#97cfa3331649\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.forbes.com/2000/07/05/feat.html#97cfa3331649 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120351492\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120351492 </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.space.com/31979-space-dot-com-new-logo.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.space.com/31979-space-dot-com-new-logo.html </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.space.com/infographics\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.space.com/infographics </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.space.com/topics\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.space.com/topics </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.space.com/skywatching\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.space.com/skywatching </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/VideoFromSpace\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/user/VideoFromSpace </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.space.com/topics/expert-voices\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.space.com/topics/expert-voices </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2010/web/general-website-categories/science/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2010/web/general-website-categories/science/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2012/web/general-website/science/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2012/web/general-website/science/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2013/web/general-website/science/spacecom/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2013/web/general-website/science/spacecom/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2014/web/general-website/science/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2014/web/general-website/science/ </a></li>\n<li>Correction example: <a href=\"https://www.space.com/7287-giant-cracks-mars-hint-ancient-lakes.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.space.com/7287-giant-cracks-mars-hint-ancient-lakes.html </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/space-com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/space-com/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/asteroid-christmas-eve/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/asteroid-christmas-eve/ </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/are-there-more-trees-on-earth-than-there-are-stars-in-the-milky-way/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/are-there-more-trees-on-earth-than-there-are-stars-in-the-milky-way/ </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.space.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.space.com/about </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.space.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.space.com/about </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120351492\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120351492 </a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"space.com","author":"Julia Press","date":"2018-08-28T14:57:44.400+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/space.com/"}}
