Goldstein started the blog in 2002 with his wife, Amy Howe, also a lawyer who has argued before the court. Goldstein has stated that most of the site’s staff work on a volunteer basis.</p>\n<p>After stepping down as editor in 2016, Howe works as an independent contractor for the site and runs her own eponymous blog, which is often cross-published on SCOTUSBlog. Goldstein is a partner at the Washington law firm Goldstein &#x26; Russell, P.C. An About page states that the site is “provided as a public service.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The blog publishes news and analysis of the U.S. Supreme Court. Writers cover each case that comes before the nation’s highest court both before and after oral argument, then assess the decision and potential impact. The site links to relevant legal documents.</p>\n<p>Regular features include Petitions of the Week, which detail the issues presented by potential cases that the site’s staff think may interest the court; a podcast produced each week that the court is in session; updates on the court’s schedule; and a daily round-up of articles about the Supreme Court from other news sources.</p>\n<p>The site is known for its Live Blogs, which provide real-time coverage of the court’s opinions, orders, and arguments, as well as of confirmation hearings for a Supreme Court nominee, including the 2018 Senate Judiciary Committee hearings into Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination. Readers can contribute to the discussion with comments or questions.</p>\n<p>The blog also publishes “symposiums” in a Special Features section, in which notable legal figures comment on matters related to the court. For example, a symposium in August and September of 2016 delved into “The Court after Scalia,” reference to the late Justice Antonin Scalia. </p>\n<p>A Plain English section highlights blog posts and guides to help readers understand legal terms and complicated legal procedures.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>SCOTUSBlog is an influential source of legal news that is frequently described as a must-read for those who follow the Supreme Court. Writers rely on primary documents, first-hand reporting, and significant legal knowledge to produce thorough coverage.</p>\n<p>Law professors and veteran lawyers frequently contribute to SCOTUSBlog. Legal journalist Lyle Denniston wrote for the site from 2004 until his retirement in 2016, after having covered the Court for 58 years.</p>\n<p>Analysis and commentary are typically labeled, with a biography of the writer that indicates his or her position on certain topics or cases.</p>\n<p>On its Administration page, the blog links to its editorial policies, which emphasize a commitment to impartiality and objectivity. The site states that it follows policies to keep site founder and publisher Goldstein’s firm and his legal work separate from the editorial mission of the blog. Lawyers are banned from reporting on cases in which their firms are involved and cases involving Goldstein &#x26; Russell must be covered by a reporter independent of both the firm and the blog. </p>\n<p>Moreover, the coverage of such cases includes clear disclosure of the firm’s involvement and “will not contain any assessments or judgments about the relative strengths of the parties’ arguments, which side is likely to prevail or what the case’s broader impact might be,” according to the Policies page.</p>\n<p>Goldstein’s litigation work has concerned the Senate Press Gallery, an organization that accredits Washington journalists to cover Congress and is a gateway to press credentials for the Supreme Court. The Gallery’s Standing Committee of Correspondents has repeatedly denied applications for a press pass from SCOTUSBlog on the basis that the site lacks sufficient separation from Goldstein’s and his firm’s legal activity. For many years, Denniston had press credentials separately through his work for a radio station.</p>\n<p>The Committee’s decision to deny SCOTUSBlog credentials has been criticized in multiple news outlets, including the Columbia Journalism Review and The New York Times. Writers have argued that the Gallery has enforced its rules in a confusing manner and not sufficiently acknowledged the policies that SCOTUSBlog has in place to ensure editorial independence.</p>\n<p>SCOTUSBlog includes a corrections policy on its Policies page and notes when posts have been updated with new information both in the headline and in the text. Corrected posts appear on a dedicated page on the site.</p>\n<p>SCOTUSBlog has won numerous awards, including a Peabody Award in 2013 for what Peabody described as “filling a gap in Supreme Court coverage created by traditional media outlets’ staff cutbacks.” It won an American Bar Association Silver Gavel award in 2010 for what the ABA called “efforts to foster public understanding of the law.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The SCOTUSBlog homepage includes a masthead with names of the site’s publisher and editorial staff. Editors and regular contributors have pages with biographical information detailing their legal expertise and professional backgrounds. For others who write, and are identified in their posts as Guests, biographical information is provided beneath headlines in italics.</p>\n<p>General contact information appears on an Administration page, and email addresses are typically provided for writers on articles they publish.</p>\n<p>Posts on the site frequently link to legal documents to provide primary source backup for coverage.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>SCOTUSBlog was started in 2002 by Goldstein and Howe. The full-time staff, as well as the number of contributors, has grown over the years, with 21 people on the masthead in August 2018.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the death of Scalia in early 2016, President Barack Obama published a piece on the site explaining what he would look for in his next nominee to the Court. His eventual nominee, Merrick Garland, was blocked by Senate Republicans.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nKendrick McDonald\n\nEdited by:\nGordon Crovitz&#x26;emsp;Steven Brill&#x26;emsp;Eric
