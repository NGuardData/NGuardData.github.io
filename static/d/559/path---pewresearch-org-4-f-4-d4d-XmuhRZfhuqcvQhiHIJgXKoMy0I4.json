It funds a diverse range of projects, particularly in the realms of public data, conservation, and health.</p>\n<p>Pew Research Center’s 990 IRS nonprofit filings show that it took in almost $40 million in revenue in 2016, nearly all of which came from donations and grants. The filing for the Pew Charitable Trusts shows that the parent organization took in $335 million in 2016.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Pewresearch.org contains a wide range of data and reports on issues in the United States and around the world. It breaks its website down into several research sections, including public opinion survey data on U.S. politics, opinion polling, and quantitative analysis of media trends. It also tracks social and demographic data charting issues such as workplace representation, marriage, divorce, and pregnancy, as well as religion, scientific trends, and analytical data on technology and social media use.</p>\n<p>The site has a special section called Hispanics, which collects opinion polling from the Hispanic community in the United States and also analyzes demographic and citizenship data. Pewresearch.org offers a searchable, alphabetized database of the topics it tracks, as well as downloadable reports and full datasets.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Pew Research Center data, particularly around public opinion, is widely relied upon across U.S. media, politics, and academia, and is often cited by major publications, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal. </p>\n<p>Articles on Pewresearch.org are meticulously sourced, with the longer reports and datasets often adding further details on how data has been obtained and analyzed.</p>\n<p>The site has a corrections policy, which advises readers to get in touch if they spot an error, and also has a detailed mission statement and code of ethics spelling out its policies around research methods and conflicts of interest.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Pewresearch.org runs a blog called Decoded on the Medium publishing platform, in which it digs deeper into its research methodologies, including highlighting internal debates and disagreements over how a given report or dataset has been put together.</p>\n<p>The site’s About page contains rich detail about what the Pew Research Center is, who runs it, and who pays for it, making its most recent 990 nonprofit filing available for download.</p>\n<p>Articles on the site do not always have clear bylines, although those that do not will often offer an downloadable report with an acknowledgements section noting who contributed research.</p>\n<p>The site makes available a list of researchers with biographies and individual contact details, and general contact details are also readily available.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Pew Research Center grew out of a research institute founded in 1990 by the Times Mirror Company, a newspaper group bought by Tribune (now Tronc) in 2000. The Pew Charitable Trusts started sponsoring the site in 1996, and renamed it the Pew Research Center for the People &#x26; the Press the same year. In 2004, the modern Pew Research Center was established in Washington, bringing a number of Pew research initiatives together under one roof.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJon Allsop\n\nEdited
