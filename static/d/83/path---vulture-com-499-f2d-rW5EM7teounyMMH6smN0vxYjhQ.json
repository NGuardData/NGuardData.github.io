Access to the site, which runs advertisements, is free.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Vulture is essentially the entertainment section of New York magazine; content published on Vulture also appears in the print edition of the publication, as well as its website. The site says it “celebrates culture both high and low, because you never know where you’ll find the next truly brilliant moment.” Vulture publishes short news articles, interviews, recaps, lists, videos, and reviews that cover television, film, music, art, comedy, theater, and books. The site absorbed Splitsider, a comedy-news site acquired by New York Media in March 2018, into its existing content in May 2018, as a dedicated comedy-news section.</p>\n<p>Flashy, bold graphics predominate. Articles are written by Vulture staff, and the site links to other New York Media properties including Grub Street and The Cut.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Vulture’s content has a lively, accessible tone evidenced in headlines such as “Nicki Minaj Hates Everyone You Hate in Cut-for-Time <em>SNL</em> Song” and “Prepare to Be Blown Away by the Child Actors in the Heartbreaking <em>Capharnaüm</em>.”</p>\n<p>The site regularly corrects and acknowledges errors as soon as it is made aware of them, according to a New York magazine spokesperson, but does not outline this policy on vulture.comStories are well-sourced and opinionated content, such as reviews and lists, is labeled accordingly.</p>\n<p>Jerry Saltz, the senior art critic at New York Magazine and Vulture, won a Pulitzer Prize for criticism in 2018.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>All articles have bylines, which link to an archive of the writer’s work. The full names and positions of editors and writers are available, as are links to their social media profiles, although no background information or email addresses are provided. A “Contact Us” link directs readers to a page on the New York magazine website, which lists email addresses and phone numbers of different departments, as well as a physical address. The page notes that individual writers and editors can be reach through traditional mail. Articles allow for reader comments.</p>\n<p>Vulture’s relationship to New York Media and New York magazine are made clear and advertisements are clearly marked.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Founded in 1968 by magazine pioneer Clay Felker and famed graphic designer Milton Glaser, New York magazine is widely credited with helping to usher in the more personal and irreverent style of writing known as New Journalism. Over the years, it has published important writers including Tom Wolfe, Nora Ephron, and Jimmy Breslin. Vulture.com was launched in 2010 as part of the magazine’s digital expansion.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nMelissa Goldin\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/09/business/09carr.html?_r=1&dbk\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/09/business/09carr.html?_r=1&#x26;dbk</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/04/new-york-magazine-oral-history.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/04/new-york-magazine-oral-history.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/culture-vulture-stands-alone/\" target=\"_blank\">https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/culture-vulture-stands-alone/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://variety.com/2018/digital/news/new-york-media-splitsider-merge-vulture-1202733838/\" target=\"_blank\">http://variety.com/2018/digital/news/new-york-media-splitsider-merge-vulture-1202733838/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2018/01/new-york-times-james-franco-cancel-event-misconduct-accusations.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.vulture.com/2018/01/new-york-times-james-franco-cancel-event-misconduct-accusations.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/jerry-saltz-new-york-magazine\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/jerry-saltz-new-york-magazine</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nymag.com/contactus/\" target=\"_blank\">http://nymag.com/contactus/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2018/05/leigh-whannell-defined-a-decade-of-horror-and-hes-not-done.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.vulture.com/2018/05/leigh-whannell-defined-a-decade-of-horror-and-hes-not-done.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2018/03/harvey-weinstein-is-at-olive-garden-planning-a-documentary.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.vulture.com/2018/03/harvey-weinstein-is-at-olive-garden-planning-a-documentary.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2018/02/last-men-in-aleppo-team-oscar-party-invites-on-travel-ban.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.vulture.com/2018/02/last-men-in-aleppo-team-oscar-party-invites-on-travel-ban.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2018/01/new-york-times-james-franco-cancel-event-misconduct-accusations.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.vulture.com/2018/01/new-york-times-james-franco-cancel-event-misconduct-accusations.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"vulture.com","author":"Melissa Goldin","date":"2018-07-20T14:06:07.179+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/vulture.com/"}}
