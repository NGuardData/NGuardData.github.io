The deal, funded in part by conservative activists and billionaires Charles and David Koch, made Meredith the largest magazine publisher in the country. Meredith has since announced plans to sell some of Time’s portfolio, including Time, Fortune, and Sports Illustrated.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>People.com publishes extensive written, photo, and video content across a variety of entertainment-focused subjects, including celebrities, movies, TV, human-interest stories, style, food, and the British royal family.</p>\n<p>PeopleTV, a free streaming network from People and Entertainment Weekly (another Meredith-owned publication), is also featured prominently on the site. The magazines have shared an editorial director, Jess Cagle, since 2014.</p>\n<p>The magazine is well known for its annual special issues naming the “World's Most Beautiful,” and “Sexiest Man Alive,” as well as its feature issues on the Oscars, country music, and a weight loss issue called “Half Their Size.”</p>\n<p>The site is more focused on celebrities than the print edition, which often features human-interest pieces on tales of survival, and reporting from mass school shootings or other developing news. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>With a few exceptions, the site refrains from publishing unsubstantiated, or at least previously unreported, gossip, but does publish material attributed to unnamed sources.</p>\n<p>Celebrities often issue exclusive statements on developments in their personal lives or responses to current events in People, or provide exclusive photos. Actress Sandra Bullock and couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, are among the superstars who provided the first public photos of their babies to People. Several media outlets reported that People paid significant fees -- some as high as $14 million -- for these and other exclusives. Asked by NewsGuard about the parameters of its payment policy for exclusives, a representative of People declined to elaborate. People’s vice president for communications, Marnie Perez, said that as a rule, the publication does not comment on its editorial process.</p>\n<p>Melania Trump threatened to sue People a month before the 2016 presidential election over a first-person account by a former People writer who claimed that Donald Trump had sexually harassed her years earlier. Mrs. Trump demanded a retraction of details in the first-person account about a reported interaction between the writer, Natasha Stoynoff, and Mrs. Trump.</p>\n<p>A lawsuit was never filed and People stood by its story.</p>\n<p>Headlines are straightforward by celebrity journalism standards, often quoting key words or phrases (“Sean Penn Says He and Ex Robin Wright Don’t ‘Share the Same Ethical Views on Parenting’”).</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Although People’s ownership, financing and the names of its editors have been widely reported, the site does not disclose this information. Stories generally credit writers and sometimes link to the writers’ Twitter profiles.</p>\n<p>The website has no clear corrections policy and does not regularly note errors. Perez, People’s spokeswoman, declined comment on its editorial process in response to NewsGuard inquiries on its corrections policy and disclosure about its leadership and content creators.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>People was founded in 1974 by the editors of Life magazine, then owned by Time Inc. People’s founding managing editor, Richard Stolley, said at the launch that the media company was “getting back to the people who are causing the news and who are caught up in it, or deserve to be in it. Our focus is on people, not issues.” </p>\n<p>People magazine is widely considered a pioneer in the genre of celebrity-oriented magazines, combining a tabloid’s interest in fame with more traditional journalism standards. Like the tabloids, People has, in recent years, offered extensive coverage of reality TV stars such as members of the Kardashian family. For many years, it was among Time, Inc.’s most profitable title.</p>\n<p>The magazine was initially printed in black and white, with a color cover. Film star Mia Farrow was the first cover subject.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nPam Weber-Leaf\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Joyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.foliomag.com/aarp-overtakes-people-per-issue/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.foliomag.com/aarp-overtakes-people-per-issue/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meredith-corporation-announces-completion-of-time-inc-acquisition-and-reports-fiscal-2018-second-quarter-and-first-half-results-300591270.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meredith-corporation-announces-completion-of-time-inc-acquisition-and-reports-fiscal-2018-second-quarter-and-first-half-results-300591270.html</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/business/media/meredith-time-sports-illustrated-fortune-money.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/business/media/meredith-time-sports-illustrated-fortune-money.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://people.com/crime/arkansas-father-allegedly-smothers-newborn-attempts-revive-electrical-cord/\" target=\"_blank\">https://people.com/crime/arkansas-father-allegedly-smothers-newborn-attempts-revive-electrical-cord/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jess-cagle-baa2674/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jess-cagle-baa2674/ </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/06/01/jennifer-garner-just-broke-a-celebrity-taboo-when-she-called-out-people-magazine/?utm_term=.7f5ac4e87192\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/06/01/jennifer-garner-just-broke-a-celebrity-taboo-when-she-called-out-people-magazine/?utm_term=.7f5ac4e87192</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/people-pay-14-million-brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-baby-photos-report-article-1.317460\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/people-pay-14-million-brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-baby-photos-report-article-1.317460</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/10/what-s-the-most-accurate-tabloid/339937/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/10/what-s-the-most-accurate-tabloid/339937/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/300940-melania-threatens-people-mag-with-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\">http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/300940-melania-threatens-people-mag-with-lawsuit </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944778,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944778,00.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/life/shopping/2004/04/sweet_and_lowdown.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.slate.com/articles/life/shopping/2004/04/sweet<em>and</em>lowdown.html </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/10/what-s-the-most-accurate-tabloid/339937/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/10/what-s-the-most-accurate-tabloid/339937/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.flowjournal.org/2013/11/the-reality-of-contemporary-stardom/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.flowjournal.org/2013/11/the-reality-of-contemporary-stardom/ </a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"people.com","author":"Pam Weber-Leaf","date":"2018-08-08T19:55:32.357+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/people.com/"}}
