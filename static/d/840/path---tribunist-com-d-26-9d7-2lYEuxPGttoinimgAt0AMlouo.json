Tribunist.com is registered to an address in Panama, and the registrant’s identity is protected by WhoIsGuard Incorporated, a service for domain owners that keeps them anonymous. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Tribunist.com stories focus on patriotism, police, and politics in the United States, and occasionally covers international military news.</p>\n<p>The site publishes articles with large photos and attention-grabbing headlines. Articles are categorized as news, military, and technology, and often have a strong point of view, with headlines such as “Photo of Soldier Watching the Birth of His Child on FaceTime Shows How Much the Military Sacrifices” and “U.S. Navy Proposes New Class of Ships to Open a Can of Whoop Ass on Enemies.” The site’s content is based on reporting from a wide range of other outlets, including The Daily Mail, CBS News, CNN, and USA Today.</p>\n<p>Articles feature embedded photos, videos, and social media posts. They do not typically include original reporting, but cite information from external sources. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>A number of Tribunist.com articles have been called into question, although not since 2016.</p>\n<p>In November 2016, Tribunist.com ran a story about a Gold Star family —  relatives of military service members who have been killed —  being booed on a commercial flight when the family was allowed to deplane first in order to make a connecting flight to retrieve their son’s remains.</p>\n<p>The article described the other passengers’ reaction as part of the “post-election backlash against anything tied to traditional patriotism.” However, the story omitted the detail, included in the original account in the Stockton, California, newspaper the Record, that the father said he did not know whether the other passengers actually knew they were a Gold Star family. </p>\n<p>Also in 2016, the Tribunist ran a story titled “Obama Administration Tells Medal of Honor Recipient He Cannot Attend Marine Corps Ball,” which claimed that U.S. Marine veteran and Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer —  a Tribunist board member who was married to Sarah Palin’s daughter —  had been uninvited from a U.S. Marine Corps birthday ball at the American embassy in Afghanistan because he was critical of the Obama administration. The story is based on a telephone interview with Meyer, but did not disclose his connection to the Tribunist. The fact-checking site Snopes.com looked into the claim and said it could not verify it.</p>\n<p>Tribunist.com does not contain a corrections policy, and NewsGuard could only find one correction ever published on the site.</p>\n<p>While it has published misleading information in the past, NewsGuard did not find any such stories after 2016, which is why it has judged the site to be gathering and presenting information responsibly. Articles written in 2017 and 2018 are generally more balanced and link to sources from across the ideological spectrum, including HuffPost, CNN, and Fox News. </p>\n<p>Some articles in the Technology section promote products, from lawn mowers to apps, but do not disclose whether such posts are paid for by those companies.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Tribunist offers no information about its ownership or funding. Stories do not include the names of the writer, and no writers or editors are named on the site. The site publishes the names and biographies of its six-person Editorial and Advisory Board, whose members are described as “third party influencers and media experts who assist in determining the editorial direction of Tribunist.com and its social media efforts.” </p>\n<p>Board members include Meyer, who was a Scout Sniper in Iraq and Afghanistan; Army veteran and fitness motivator John Burk, who is known for his viral videos including one in which he called obese people “repulsive;” and a man identified as Officer Daniels, a police officer and social media personality.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard tried multiple times and methods to reach the site for comment about its ownership, approach to corrections, lack of information about content creators, and labeling of paid content.</p>\n<p>The site could not be reached directly, as the Contact Us page did not work. An email asking to speak to staff about Tribunist’s ownership and editorial policies, sent to an address disclosed only in the site’s privacy policy, was not returned. NewsGuard sent separate messages to members of the site’s Advisory Board via their Facebook and LinkedIn profiles, asking about ownership, financing, and corrections — none of which were returned. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site was registered in January 2015.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label included a description of a story on the site relating to a VA hospital’s treatment of human remains. The label inaccurately said the Tribunist story was based only on a CBS Chicago segment and contained details that were unsupported by that source. Actually, the story was based on both a CBS segment and a Fox News story, which contained those additional details. The reference to the VA article has been removed from this label.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nRachel Treisman\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric
