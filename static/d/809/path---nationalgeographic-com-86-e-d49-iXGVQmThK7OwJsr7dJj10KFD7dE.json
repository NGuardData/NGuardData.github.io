National Geographic is known for its extensive use of high quality digital photography, specifically nature and travel photography. It regularly holds photo contests in which readers can submit pictures. </p>\n<p>Articles published on the site aim to educate and inspire readers about the less-known regions and cultures of the world. Stories focus on people, places, cultures, and wildlife, as well as science, environmental issues, and history. Many of the longer, in-depth articles and profiles are written in the first person, making clear that information will be mixed with opinion. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Nationalgeographic.com is widely regarded as a credible science publication site. As the website for a science-based institution, Nationalgeographic.com publishes factual and credible stories, often bolstered with scientific evidence and input from experts in relevant fields. National Geographic magazine and members of its staff have won multiple journalism awards, including numerous National Magazine Awards. In February 2017, National Geographic received a National Magazine Award for “Best Website.”  </p>\n<p>The website has a “Corrections and Clarifications” page, which links to both brief clarifications and detailed revisions of featured stories, explaining what was corrected. For example, an Editor’s Note posted in July 2018 noted that a widely shared video story published in December 2017 used a photo of a starving polar bear to make statements about climate change that were not backed up by facts. “National Geographic went too far in drawing a definitive connection between climate change and a particular starving polar bear,” the note stated.</p>\n<p>In April 2018, National Geographic and its website featured an article of self-examination by editor-in-chief Susan Goldberg that acknowledged the publication’s past racist coverage. “It hurts to share the appalling stories from the magazine’s past,” Ms. Goldberg wrote. “But when we decided to devote our April magazine to the topic of race, we thought we should examine our own history before turning our reportorial gaze to others.” The article, part of a special edition entitled “The Race Issue,” cited aspects of the magazine’s history that reflected racism, conveyed through language, choice of photographs, stereotypical coverage of non-Western cultures, and failure to include the voices of those pictured and chronicled. </p>\n<p>Examples are many, ranging from a 1962 article about South African gold miners that ignored apartheid, to a photo caption in a 1916 feature about Australia that describes Aboriginal people as “savages,” who “rank lowest in intelligence of all human beings.” Goldberg was widely praised for her leadership in the creation of the special issue. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Sources are cited and photographers are credited. Most bylines link to the writer’s biographical page and social media pages. The Leadership page provides full biographies for the Senior Team, and links to a list of the Board of Trustees and International Counsel of Advisors.</p>\n<p>The Contact Us page provides a question and comments form, as well as phone numbers and email links for customer service requests, donations, and general information. Sponsored content is marked as such.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The first issue of <em>National Geographic </em>was printed in September 1888. Nationalgeographic.com was launched in June 1996.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nKat Harling\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Joyce
