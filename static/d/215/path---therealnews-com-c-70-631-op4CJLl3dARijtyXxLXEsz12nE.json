TRNN was started by Paul Jay, a documentary filmmaker and former executive producer of a debate show on the Canadian Broadcast Corporation. Jay serves as TRNN’s chief executive officer and senior editor.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>TRNN says that its reporting is “imbued with historical and social context,” and that its “main focus is the search for answers to the social, economic, and environmental challenges.” The site provides local (Baltimore), national and international news coverage through videos that include documentary-style footage and commentary by TRNN journalists.</p>\n<p>TRNN’s videos often include a mixture of clips from other news organizations, on-site reporting, and interviews with policymakers, scholars, and journalists. Content is categorized by region and topic, ranging from U.S. politics and climate change to human rights in developing countries. The site features a number of original programs, including “The Real Baltimore,” which reports on local issues, and “Real News Daily Reports.”    </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>TRNN often provides original on-site video reporting for stories set in Baltimore. Information is typically attributed to subject-matter experts and people with firsthand knowledge about the topic in question. For its national and international coverage, videos often include clips from credible media outlets, which are credited. Headlines accurately reflect the content.</p>\n<p>On the About page, TRNN states that its mission is to produce “independent, verifiable, fact-based journalism that engages ordinary people in solving the critical problems of our times.” The site states that it focuses on “the movements for working peoples’ rights, for peace, for the health of our planet, and against racism.” The people it considers “newsmakers,” TRNN says, are those “who fight for human rights and work for solutions.”</p>\n<p>Addressing the question of its own objectivity and transparency, TRNN states: “We all have interests. This affects the facts we consider important and the sources we decide to trust.”</p>\n<p>TRNN’s content is typically infused with a point of view. For example, a video released after the funeral of President George H.W. Bush in December 2018 described the former president as “an elite custodian of capitalism and empire,” who “paved the way for Trumpism.” A video titled “Police Brutality and the Failure of Liberal Democrats,” makes the case that liberal doctrine alone “will not end institutional racism.”  </p>\n<p>Because TRNN is upfront about its agenda and has not been found to misstate or distort facts, NewsGuard has determined that the site meets the standard for handling the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<p>TRNN does not state a corrections policy but the site publishes corrections in the form of a note at the bottom of stories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>TRNN names and provides information about its content creators, editors, management, and board members. On the Our Mission page, TRNN lists its major contributors, which include The Park Foundation, The Flora Family Foundation, and The Benjamin Fund. </p>\n<p>The site does not run advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>TRNN was launched in 2007.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nJohn Gregory&#x26;emsp;Eric
