Lee Enterprises’ newspapers generate revenue from advertising and subscriptions to their printed and digital editions.</p>\n<p>Cumberlink.com users can read a limited number of free articles before paying for a digital subscription. The Sentinel also publishes the monthly Cumberland Valley Business Journal.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Cumberlink.com publishes local news around Carlisle and the surrounding area, including the state capital of Harrisburg and its West Shore suburbs along the Susquehanna River. The site publishes breaking news on crimes, court cases, and accidents, as well as in-depth series tagged “Closer Look.” Topics for the series have included the aging prison population, and the homeless population in Cumberland County, including homeless veterans and women.</p>\n<p>The newspaper also features multiple articles a week that use the Sentinel’s archives to recount historical events. A section called The Scene covers nightlife, arts and entertainment, and restaurant reviews.</p>\n<p>The site also publishes national and state stories from The Associated Press and Tribune News Service.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Local reporting conducted by The Sentinel generally relies on firsthand interviews with law enforcement agencies, businesses, emergency professionals and local government officials. Headlines accurately reflect the content of articles. The newspaper does not provide a corrections policy, although it routinely issues corrections, typically in notes at the bottom of stories.</p>\n<p>Columns, letters, and editorials appear in the Opinion section, separate from news stories.</p>\n<p>In April 2018, The Sentinel received 12 awards at the Pennsylvania Associated Press Managing Editors News Excellence and NewsPhoto Contest Awards, including two related to reporting on the opioid epidemic in Cumberland County: Best General News Reporting award for the story “Opioids in Cumberland County,” and the Best Public Service award for “Understanding Overdose,” a series on overdose deaths in the county.  As part of its coverage, the newspaper developed an app to connect residents to substance abuse treatment.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles are generally credited to individual writers. The Staff page lists the names of Sentinel editors, reporters and business staff, along with their phone numbers, email addresses and Twitter handles. The website also links to a Contact page, which provides a general phone number for the newspaper. The site’s About Us page states that Lee Enterprises bought The Sentinel in 2002. </p>\n<p>The site publishes sponsored articles provided by the ad company Zergnet under a heading called Around the Web, which does not meet NewsGuard’s standards for clearly labeling advertising. John Humenik, Lee Enterprises’ vice president of news told NewsGuard that the company is reviewing its labeling of sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Sentinel was first published in 1861 as The Valley Sentinel, originally based in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. It moved its newsroom to Carlisle in 1874. The Thompson family, headed by Sentinel editor David R. Thompson, took over the paper in the late 1800s and ran the newspaper for more than 80 years, selling it to Howard Publications in 1968, according to the website.</p>\n<p>Lee Enterprises purchased 15 Howard Publications newspapers in 2002, including the Sentinel.</p>\n<p>Cumberlink.com launched in July 1995.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSophia Tewa\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;John
