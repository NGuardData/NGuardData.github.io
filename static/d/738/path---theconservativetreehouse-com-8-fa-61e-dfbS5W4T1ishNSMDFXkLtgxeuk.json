The Conservative Tree House derives revenue through advertisements and reader donations, which the site solicits through PayPal.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The About page describes its mission as being a “Last Refuge” for conservatives from “the turmoil of storms” caused by liberals. The Conservative Tree House features “open threads” on topics such as presidential politics and local elections, with readers encouraged to leave comments and discuss politics. The site publishes commentaries on news items based on press releases, videos, or transcripts of President Trump or other administration officials speaking or attending events.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site regularly publishes false, unproven, or misleading information, blurring the line between opinion and fact. Over the course of a week, the site claimed without reliable evidence that mainstream media outlets were “front-loading bad news in a coordinated effort to influence polls still open” in the midterm elections, and called Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony against Brett Kavanaugh a “smear campaign.” It also suggested that Ford was likely “selected/recruited” by a former FBI agent and “her allies” to take down Kavanaugh. It accused the FBI of “a classic entrapment sting operation” of George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about interactions with Russian intermediaries during the campaign.</p>\n<p>A September 2017 story falsely stated that the International Brotherhood of Teamsters had organized a strike of Puerto Rican truck drivers, who were refusing to assist in hurricane relief efforts. The story relied on specific quotes taken out of context and was not corrected after the Teamsters rejected the claim as false.</p>\n<p>In July 2016, the site published a story accusing Philando Castile of being a suspect in an armed robbery before Minnesota police stopped and fatally shot him during a traffic stop. The story cited an audio clip submitted from a listener to a local television station that claimed to feature the officers discussing Castile’s resemblance to an armed robbery suspect. Beyond the clip’s unverified nature, resemblance to a suspect did not make Castile a suspect. The story also falsely claimed that Castile lacked a permit to carry a gun. Minnesota police confirmed that he did have a permit. The site also reported an unproven allegation that Castile was in a gang.</p>\n<p>It does not appear that the site regularly corrects or clarifies storiesm as several examples remain on the site unchanged. There is no clear way for readers to report errors, other than a general contact email address for the site. The site did not respond to two emails seeking information about its corrections policy or editorial process.</p>\n<p>Conservative Tree House appears on a list of sites that “have posted deceptive content” published by FactCheck.org, a project from the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site does not disclose information about its owners, editors, or content creators. All stories are attributed to a user called “sundance,” about whom no biographical or contact information is provided. The only contact information on the site is a general email address. Two emails sent to this address, seeking information about the failure to disclose those responsible for the site’s content, received no response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>According to a domain registry search, TheConservativeTreehouse.com was created in 2011.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJulia Press\n\nEdited by:\nKendrick McDonald&#x26;emsp;Jim
