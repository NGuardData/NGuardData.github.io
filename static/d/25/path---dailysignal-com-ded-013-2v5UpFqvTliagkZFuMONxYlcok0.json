The site also features a special section on taxes and another containing discussion podcasts.</p>\n<p>News stories feature firsthand interviews and cite reliable outside news organizations, such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Reader letters, as well as commentary pieces by Daily Signal staff, reflect the views of The Heritage Foundation.</p>\n<p>Many of the site’s news stories come from The Daily Caller News Foundation, the nonprofit reporting arm of The Daily Caller, a conservative news site.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Daily Signal produces original content that is well-sourced, featuring rigorous analysis and exclusive interviews with prominent officials and political leaders. In 2015, The Daily Signal was one of the first foreign publications covering the battle in Ukraine with a journalist on the front line of combat.</p>\n<p>The site and its parent foundation have close ties to President Donald Trump and his administration, and White House officials frequently give interviews to Daily Signal journalists. </p>\n<p>“Like any news outlet, we welcome the opportunity to speak to those who determine and have an impact on the policies that will in turn directly affect Americans’ lives. We are proud of having had a chance to ask administration officials to weigh in on important policy topics, and only wish the Obama administration had been more open to such interviews,” said Katrina Trinko, director and managing editor of The Daily Signal, in an email to NewsGuard.</p>\n<p>All content is clearly labeled news, commentary, or analysis. News articles themselves are straightforward and objective, presenting multiple sides of issues — even acknowledging arguments that run counter to the stances of The Heritage Foundation. For example, a July 2018 story discussed the Trump administration’s efforts to stop state governments from automatically deducting a portion of home care providers’ Medicaid stipend in order to fund labor unions. The article acknowledged that those opposed to the efforts considered it an attempt to prevent home care workers from unionizing, even though The Heritage Foundation has historically been anti-union. </p>\n<p>The site has acknowledged criticism from those who doubt that a conservative think tank can produce objective news. In a 2014 interview with the Poynter Institute for Media Studies,  Geoffrey Lysaught, the site’s publisher at the time, called this skepticism “the No. 1 challenge that we face,\" adding that “it's a challenge we're well-positioned to face.\" In the same interview with the Poynter Institute, The Daily Signal’s editor, Robert Bluey, pointed to the distinction between news and opinion content, and the balance of perspectives in stories, as evidence. </p>\n<p>The site’s Contact Us page provides an email address for reporting corrections, and the site regularly makes corrections, usually in an italicized note at the end of a story. Trinko said the managing editor signs off on any correction. Minor changes are noted at the bottom of stories and a major error will be referred to within the body of the article, she said. Trinko said minor errors that are caught almost immediately after publication will occasionally be corrected without a separate notation.</p>\n<p>DailySignal.com sometimes quotes Heritage Foundation members in stories and publishes stories related to the foundation efforts. Over a two-day period in July 2018, four out of nine Daily Signal news stories quoted foundation members. When asked about this practice, Trinko told NewsGuard, “It is common in journalism to quote think tank researchers, and Heritage researchers regularly appear in mainstream news outlets. We would be foolish to deny our own readers that insight, and so we do provide that.” She added that experts from other think tanks and groups, and politicians with diverse ideologies are also quoted in Daily Signal articles.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Dailysignal.com contains an Authors page with photos, biographies, and contact information for its editors and journalists. Articles name authors and link to their biography pages. Stories sourced from outside contributors and news organizations also name their author with a brief description. A Contact Us page provides email addresses for readers with comments, correction suggestions, or other general inquiries.</p>\n<p>The site makes clear its connection to The Heritage Foundation and links to Heritage.org, containing detailed information about the leadership, mission, and financing of the organization.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Heritage Foundation launched The Daily Signal in June 2014 with the goal of providing straight news reports on political stories that were going unreported.</p>\n<p>The Foundation made previous attempts to launch a news service: first through the website Townhall.com, which was acquired by Salem Communications in 2005; then through a blog on Heritage.org called The Foundry, which was replaced by The Daily Signal.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
