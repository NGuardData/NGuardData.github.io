Revenues from Foreign Affairs help fund the CFR. The website uses a paywall and runs advertisements and sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Foreign Affairs publishes analyses of international news, trends and challenges. For example, it assessed how the U.S. “ceded leadership in cyberspace to China,” and how India and the European Union are in the forefront of dealing with internet developments. The magazine has published influential essays, among them Zheng Bijian’s \"China’s ‘Peaceful Rise’ to Great Power Status,” Samuel Huntington’s \"The Clash of Civilizations,\" and George Kennan’s \"The Sources of Soviet Conduct.\" The 1947 Kennan analysis, which was signed “X” though his authorship became widely known, helped to foster the post-World War II U.S. Cold War strategy of “containing” the spread of communism. The October 2018 death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul prompted a critical profile of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It detailed how the 33-year-old heir to the Saudi throne had moved his government from “deeply ingrained caution to brutal impetuousness” and demonstrated “a recklessness that is deeply at odds with U.S. interests.”</p>\n<p>In addition to longer commentaries, foreignaffairs.com publishes shorter, web-oriented regular features. They include “Letters From” (on-the-ground reporting from abroad), “Snapshots” (quick analyses of current affairs and policy), and “Postscripts” (pieces by past Foreign Affairs authors reflecting on how their articles have stood the test of time).</p>\n<p>The publication hosts essays from prominent individuals. Past Foreign Affairs authors have included U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, former U.S. President Barack Obama, former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. The November-December 2018 issue, which was dedicated to the question “Do Nuclear Arms Matter?” also included an essay by Secretary of State Michael Pompeo on U.S. strategy toward Iran.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Encyclopaedia Britannica describes Foreign Affairs as “one of the most prestigious periodicals of its kind in the world,\" describing its work as “authoritative and scholarly” and noting it “has an international reputation for its careful and probing analyses of political, economic, and social developments on the world scene.” Articles are typically written by experts in their field, with each staff writer’s biography detailing their area of expertise. Articles are frequently cited elsewhere due to the publication’s reputation.</p>\n<p>Foreign Affairs states in its submission guidelines that “We do not have fact checkers and rely on authors to ensure the veracity of their statements,” expanding that “contributors should be able to provide appropriate citations for any facts or quotations their pieces contain.” The website does not have a corrections page or a stated corrections policy. Foreign Affairs did not respond to two NewsGuard emails asking about the publication’s corrections procedures.</p>\n<p>In 2003, CFR senior fellow Kenneth Maxwell resigned from Foreign Affairs, alleging the outlet’s editorial independence was compromised by its editors’ eagerness to please politically influential members. Despite Maxwell's claim, Foreign Affairs has often run content critical of CFR members.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles consistently provide their author’s name, biographical information, credentials, and contact details. The Staff page lists all Foreign Affairs employees and editor Gideon Rose has a full page providing his background, email, and telephone number. Sponsored content is labeled, and advertisements are clearly distinguished from news content. Foreign Affairs’ ownership by the CFR is disclosed across the site and CFR’s website in turn publicly discloses its income and lists all its directors, advisors, staff, and members.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Foreign Affairs was founded in 1922 -- the year after the CFR was founded -- to broaden CFR’s reach beyond the small number who attended its meetings and conferences. Business research firm Erdos &#x26; Morgan regularly ranks Foreign Relations in the ten most influential U.S. media outlets among \"thought leaders who shape policy and opinion in the public and private sectors.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBron Maher\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
