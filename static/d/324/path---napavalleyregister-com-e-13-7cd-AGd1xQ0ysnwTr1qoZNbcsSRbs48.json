Lee Enterprises newspapers generate revenue from advertising and subscriptions to their printed and digital editions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The website publishes originally-produced local, state, and regional news, as well as business, entertainment, and opinion content. It also runs stories from wire services. The website has a section for wine news. The newspaper also publishes Inside Napa Valley, a quarterly magazine. In 2018, the magazine won first place for special sections in the California Newspaper Publishers Association Better Newspapers Contest.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The website does not present opinion as fact. Stories regularly attribute sources of information and images and reference primary sources, including government officials. Headlines and images accurately reflect content. The website runs corrections at the bottom of relevant articles, as Editor Sean Scully said in a phone interview with NewsGuard, and NewsGuard confirmed independently. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Stories have author names and link to their biographies and contact information. The website also provides contact information in a Contact Us page. The Staff section includes names and contact details for reporters and editorial leadership.</p>\n<p>The website does not disclose ownership details in an easily accessible way, naming Lee Enterprises only in the site’s legal notices such as its privacy policy. “We don’t hide it, but we don’t make a big deal about it,” said Scully when NewsGuard asked about the difficulty in finding an ownership reference.</p>\n<p>Display advertisements are clearly labeled and sponsored content frequently features an “advertorial” tag. Some articles published before December 2017 that advertise products or services were not clearly identifiable as sponsored content. For example, a July 2017 article attributed to “Brandpoint,” appeared to promote an auto show, SEMA.</p>\n<p>“On sponsored content we do label items where we ourselves have received compensation,” explained Scully in email correspondence. “Brandpoint, however, is a free service, at least to us (I believe the producers do pay Brandpoint, however, but I am not privy to those terms). I have to confess that I am surprised to find any Brandpoint content on our site at all – locally at least, we only use them for non-news, advertiser-driven special sections and specialty magazines in the print product only. I can’t find a single case since our current content management system was installed almost five years ago where my staff has posted a Brandpoint piece to the web.”</p>\n<p>He later added, “One of my employees locally did, in fact, post those to the web accidentally as he was prepping some advertiser-driven print products, but he did so in a way that was hard for me to discover, so I am going to take them down entirely.”</p>\n<p>As of September 2018, the website removed unlabeled sponsored content. “...there is still some Brandpoint content coming through from several corporate channels, such as Senior Living and Family Living, but all of that seems to display under a prominent tag of ‘Advertorial’,” said Scully in an email. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Napa Valley Register was founded in 1863. Throughout the 1860s, the front page featured poems. During the Civil War, the newspaper’s editorial stance was pro-Union. </p>\n<p>In 2017, the newspaper won a first place award at the California Newspapers Publishers Association Better Newspapers Contest for a feature about a murder trial, which resulted in the convictions of three-year-old Kayleigh Slusher’s mother and the mother’s boyfriend. In 2018, the newspaper’s sports section won third place, and the newspaper won third place in General Excellence in the statewide contest.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJennie Kamin\n\nEdited
