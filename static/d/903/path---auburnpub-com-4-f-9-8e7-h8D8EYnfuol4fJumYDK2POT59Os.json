Lee Enterprises’ newspapers generate revenue from advertising and subscriptions to their printed and digital editions.</p>\n<p>Auburnbpub.com charges users for unlimited access to its content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Auburnpub.com publishes fact-based daily reports on crime, fires, and auto accidents.The website’s news on a typical day also included an enterprise story about leaders in Auburn seeking input from historically marginalized members of the community on how to spend a $10 million downtown revitalization grant.</p>\n<p>Auburnpub.com publishes a Lake Life section on the state’s Finger Lakes, and an On this Day in History item that displays a photograph from the paper’s archives and short explanatory text. The sports section covers Syracuse University's athletic teams. </p>\n<p>The site hosts five community blogs, including Citizen Pop, the newspaper's entertainment blog and Eye on NY, which covers state and national political news. The site posts entertainment news content, such as event guides, reviews, and profiles of local performers. Many lifestyle articles are provided by other entertainment news websites, such as TV Guide, Simplemost and Greatist. The newspaper also publishes state and national articles from The Associated Press and Bloomberg News.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Stories on auburnpub.com cite reliable sources, including government officials, law enforcement agencies, people with firsthand knowledge of events, and subject experts. Over the years, The Citizen has won many top journalism prizes from the New York State Associated Press Association. In 2017, it won a best feature writing first-place award for its “Holy Harassment?” article about street preaching in Auburn, and a first-place award for best editorial writing. </p>\n<p>Auburnpub.com does not post a corrections policy, but the website corrects erroneous articles in standalone items that explain the mistake.</p>\n<p>Editorials, commentary and letters to the editor are posted in an opinion section that is separate from the news section.</p>\n<p>Headlines accurately reflect story content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p> The Citizen's Contact Us page discloses that the newspaper is a division of Lee. It also links to a staff page that lists the names and contact information of editors and reporters, along with their social media handles. Articles produced by Citizen staff generally include the author's email address. </p>\n<p>The site advertises sponsored content under each article with the heading \"From the Web.\" These links are provided by the ad company ZergNet and are not clearly marked as advertising or sponsored content. The newspaper did not respond to two emails and one phone call from NewsGuard inquiring about the company's advertising disclosure practices. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>In 1931, two Auburn newspapers, The Auburn Citizen and the Advertiser Journal, merged to form The Citizen-Advertiser. Howard Publications acquired the newspaper in 1975. A year later, the newspaper became the Citizen-Advertiser. In 2003, Lee Enterprises purchased the paper from Howard Publications for $694 million.</p>\n<p>Former Citizen reporter William Osborne Dapping, who later became the newspaper’s managing editor, won a special Pulitzer Prize in 1930 for his coverage of a  Dec. 11, 1929,  prison riot in Auburn that left the chief warden and eight inmates dead.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSophia Tewa\n\nEdited
