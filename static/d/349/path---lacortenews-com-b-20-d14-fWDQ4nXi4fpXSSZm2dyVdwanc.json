LaCorte News is based in Sausalito, California, according to Linkedin.</p>\n<p>The website was founded by Bivona Digital owner Ken LaCorte, a former Fox News senior vice president who left the cable network in November 2016. LaCorte News editor-in-chief John Moody, who is a former executive vice president at Fox News, holds an equity stake in the company, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The site runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>LaCorteNews.com provides a curated stream of national and international headlines from other news websites. It focuses on a variety of topics, including politics, crime, movies, celebrity news, and recipes. The site also shares short viral content, such as humorous images, animal videos, or political tweets.</p>\n<p>Most articles contain a short summary of stories published elsewhere, such as The Washington Post, NBC News and CBS News. These posts generally credit and link back to the site that originally published the article. LaCorte News occasionally produces its own articles and analysis, generally about national politics. For example, in January 2019, the site posted a summary of President Donald Trump's second year in office.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The website link to articles from reliable news organizations, including The Associated Press and Reuters. Some stories are attributed to anonymous or crowdsourced platforms, such as YouTube or Reddit. In January 2019, the site posted two stories that only credited Wikipedia as a source: \"TRUE FACT: Test pilot Chuck Yeager, the first man to break the sound barrier in level flight in 1947, is still alive and well in Northern California\" and \"TRUE FACT: Sigmund Freud on the Nazis burning his books ... ‘What progress we are making. In the Middle Ages they would have burned me. Now, they are content with burning my books.’”</p>\n<p>The website does not have a posted corrections policy, but NewsGuard found examples of corrections on the site disclosed in a note at the bottom of articles.</p>\n<p>Stories offering opinion and analysis are clearly labeled as such in the headline. LaCorte News views itself as politically balanced, stating on its About page that its editors \"bring decades of experience at the highest levels of journalism, as well as political balance to a news site that's pledging to be open and honest.\" Examples of opinion articles shared on the site include “Opinion: Why the new Democratic majority could work better than the last,” originally published in The Atlantic in January 2019, and an Associated Press article titled “Opinion piece: Has Beto O'Rourke lost presidential momentum?” which questioned whether the former Democratic congressman and U.S. Senate candidate was taking too long to decide on running in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.</p>\n<p>Headlines accurately reflect the content of stories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>LaCorte News discloses on its About page that it is owned by Bivona Digital Inc. and provides a list of its investors. The page also features a short biography of LaCorte and its editor in chief John Moody, along with a general email address. The site’s Contact page includes the same email address along with a phone number.</p>\n<p>Most posts do not include the author's name. Moody told NewsGuard in a phone interview that the editorial team plans to add full biographies for both full-time staffers and contributors.</p>\n<p>“We are in the process of staffing up,” Moody said. “And it was something that we said we were going to do.”</p>\n<p>Advertisements are distinguishable from editorial posts.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The website launched in December 2018 with about $1 million in funding, according to Politico.</p>\n<p>Before joining LaCorte News, John Moody was an executive vice president at Fox News. He resigned in March 2018, after writing a Fox News column titled \"In Olympics, let’s focus on the winner of the race—not the race of the winner,” which suggested that the 2018 U.S. Olympic Committee had diversity quotas and should change its slogan to “darker, gayer, different.” Fox News retracted the piece, stating that it did not reflect its \"views\" or \"values.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSophia Tewa\n\nEdited by:\nJohn Gregory&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
