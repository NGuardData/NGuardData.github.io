Jacobson, who is director of Cornell University’s Securities Law Clinic, is the founder, publisher, and a frequent contributor.</p>\n<p>The site runs advertising and accepts donations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>At the top of every page, there is a definition of the term “Legal Insurrection”: “‘A rising up against established authority; rebellion; revolt ‘in conformity with or permitted by law.’” Sections include Quick Takes (the site’s blog content), College (stories about campus issues), Cartoons (which are mostly cartoons from conservative cartoonist A.F. Branco), and Forum (comments from readers).</p>\n<p>Most articles consist of commentary on issues raised by other outlets, with occasional original opinion pieces. Coverage centers on U.S. politics, culture and legal affairs, including Supreme Court decisions, congressional elections, and free speech on college campuses. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is also a regular topic. Jacobson comments regularly on Senator Elizabeth Warren’s claims of Native American ancestry, and maintained his critical stance after she disclosed a DNA test that “suggested lineage to a distant Native American ancestor,” as stated by The Washington Post. His commentary was headlined, “DNA Disaster: Elizabeth Warren proved she doesn’t have what it takes to take on Trump.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Stories cite credible news organizations and websites. Sources are hyperlinked within articles. Legal Insurrection does not distort facts to advance opinions and discloses its conservative perspective on an About page, leading NewsGuard to conclude that the site handles the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>Legal Insurrection does not articulate a corrections policy. Jacobson told NewsGuard in an email: “If there is a minor non-substantive correction, such as a name spelling or job title correction, we generally just make the change. More commonly, when there is additional information that puts the original story in a different context or presents an alternative view or new information, we do that as an ‘Update.’” Because the site has not issued corrections since 2016, and NewsGuard does not classify updates as corrections, Legal Insurrection does not meet NewsGuard’s standards for regularly correcting or clarifying errors.</p>\n<p>Headlines can be opinionated, but do not distort facts or mislead readers about the content of stories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles are attributed to specific authors, and readers can click on a writer’s name to learn his or her background. Some contributors’ biographies include email addresses, social media information, or personal websites. The site lists editors and writers. Two contributors write under pseudonyms, but because they are not major contributors, NewsGuard has determined that the site provides information about content creators.</p>\n<p>An About page discloses ownership by Jacobson and WAJ Media. Advertisements are clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Jacobson launched Legal Insurrection in October 2008, frustrated by what he called “the mass delusion of Obamamania sweeping the nation, and the blatant media bias” toward then-presidential candidate Barack Obama.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nNina Zweig\n\nEdited by:\nJosh Keefe&#x26;emsp;Jim
