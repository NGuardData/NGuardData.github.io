Quality, content, and length can vary greatly. Medium.com regularly features the work of credible publications such as Rolling Stone, the Guardian, and Bloomberg News, but most content is contributed by individual writers with varying backgrounds. Although Medium does not claim to publish news, many stories are frequently a mix of news and opinion, some of which use evocative language and headlines. Examples include, “Iran Hawks Should Be Careful What They Wish For” and “No, you don’t have ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome.’”</p>\n<p>Politicians and other public figures have posted first-person updates and news on the platform. Members of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign posted an open letter on Medium.com in 2017 after revelations that Democratic party leader Donna Brazile had considered replacing Clinton on the ticket.</p>\n<p>While political stories do feature both liberal and conservative perspectives, the majority of the content is left-leaning in its portrayal of President Trump and social issues in the U.S.</p>\n<p>The platform features a “Future Human” section, which covers science and technology. “Culture” features personal essays, movie reviews, and travelogues. In other sections, readers can find advice columns from self-described life coaches, stories about entrepreneurship from business people, political analysis, and commentary. Medium includes audio versions of some of its written content, which is available to paying subscribers.</p>\n<p>Medium also features stories about psychedelic drugs, living with disabilities, and philosophy.</p>\n<p>Medium offers subscriptions for unlimited access to premium content on the website. It also pays writers based on the engagement their stories get.  </p>\n<p>The platform has some rules governing the type of content allowed on the website. Writers may not post threatening or violent stories, spam, or otherwise deceptive content that impersonates people and organizations. Medium’s rules state that parody and satirical content is permitted only if it is clearly labeled as such.</p>\n<p>Stories on medium.com provide the names of authors, and readers can find biographical information about them. Readers cannot contact writers directly through the website, but author bios often provide social media handles. Medium publishes a blog that details news about the company and provides the names of its staff and senior management, but it is not possible to contact staff directly.</p>\n<p>In addition to the contributions of Williams, its founder, several venture capital firms have invested in Medium, including Andreessen Horowitz and Spark Capital.</p>\n<p>In January 2017, Williams wrote in a blog post that Medium would stop selling advertisements on its website because ad-driven media on the internet is a “broken system,” and that the company is “shifting our resources and attention to defining a new model for writers and creators to be rewarded, based on the value they’re creating for people.”</p>\n<p>The company laid off 50 employees at that time.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/technology/evan-williams-medium-twitter-internet.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/technology/evan-williams-medium-twitter-internet.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/25/twitter-co-founder-evan-williams-blogging-platform-medium-opens-signups-to-all/\" target=\"_blank\">https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/25/twitter-co-founder-evan-williams-blogging-platform-medium-opens-signups-to-all/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.medium.com/the-medium-model-3ec28c6f603a\" target=\"_blank\">https://blog.medium.com/the-medium-model-3ec28c6f603a</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.inc.com/dave-schools/medium-announces-new-look-and-new-way-to-pay-write.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.inc.com/dave-schools/medium-announces-new-look-and-new-way-to-pay-write.html </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.medium.com/renewing-mediums-focus-98f374a960be\" target=\"_blank\">https://blog.medium.com/renewing-mediums-focus-98f374a960be </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-the-meltdown-of-evan-williams-startup-medium-2017-2\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-the-meltdown-of-evan-williams-startup-medium-2017-2 </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/topics\" target=\"_blank\">https://medium.com/topics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/how-facial-recognition-tech-could-tear-us-apart-c4486c1ee9c4\" target=\"_blank\">https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/how-facial-recognition-tech-could-tear-us-apart-c4486c1ee9c4 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/to-live-a-better-life-think-about-death-430b973febd\" target=\"_blank\">https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/to-live-a-better-life-think-about-death-430b973febd </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/topic/psychedelics\" target=\"_blank\">https://medium.com/topic/psychedelics </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/creators\" target=\"_blank\">https://medium.com/creators</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/213477928-Medium-Rules\" target=\"_blank\">https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/213477928-Medium-Rules </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/rollingstone/bo-burnham-on-eighth-grade-anxiety-and-why-social-media-is-a-curse-3a1cdf13c589\" target=\"_blank\">https://medium.com/rollingstone/bo-burnham-on-eighth-grade-anxiety-and-why-social-media-is-a-curse-3a1cdf13c589 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@RollingStone\" target=\"_blank\">https://medium.com/@RollingStone </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@The_Guardian\" target=\"_blank\">https://medium.com/@The_Guardian </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/foreign-policy/iran-hawks-should-be-careful-what-they-wish-for-6b91c240fb2b\" target=\"_blank\">https://medium.com/foreign-policy/iran-hawks-should-be-careful-what-they-wish-for-6b91c240fb2b </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/3minread\" target=\"_blank\">https://medium.com/3minread</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.medium.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">https://blog.medium.com/about </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/technology/evan-williams-medium-twitter-internet.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/technology/evan-williams-medium-twitter-internet.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"medium.com","author":"Evan Haddad","date":"2018-07-27T17:43:45.357+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/medium.com/"}}
