While ConservativeReview.com discloses its ownership by CRTV LLC, it does not provide information about the people involved in its ownership. </p>\n<p>CRTV is financed by subscriptions, advertisements, Facebook Instant articles, and sponsored podcasts, the site’s executive editor, Gaston Mooney, told NewsGuard.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>ConservativeReview.com acknowledges its editorial perspective in several places on the site, including its About Us and FAQ sections. “Conservative principles are the guiding North Star for Conservative Review,” reads an FAQ answer. The site states its principles include “limited government, free markets, traditional family values, individual freedom, rule of law, and a strong national defense.” ConservativeReview.com describes itself as an “antidote to the left wing media entities that dominate our airwaves and online news sources.”</p>\n<p>The site’s homepage houses sections titled News, Podcasts, Scorecard, Top 25, and Elections. The Scorecard and Top 25 sections feature Conservative Review’s Liberty Scores, which grade congressional members based on what the site describes as their “top 50 votes over a rolling six-year term,” and how these votes aligned with Conservative Review’s definition of conservative principles. </p>\n<p>In addition to the site’s own commentary pieces and articles about CRTV show segments, Conservative Review aggregates content from conservative sites, including Daily Wire and National Review. Clicking on Conservative Review headlines often takes readers to another site where the original story was published. Executive editor Mooney told NewsGuard that when choosing other news sources to feature, the site’s editors “try to keep it to things in the right of center mainstream.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>CRTV employs a handful of staff members who create content for ConservativeReview.com. They are supplemented by syndicated authors and freelancers, Mooney told NewsGuard in a phone interview. The site’s commentary and selection of stories often serve to emphasize perceived liberal and Democratic outrages. The highest ranked Democrat in Conservative Review’s Liberty Score rankings in September 2018 was Pennsylvania U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb, who, with a score of 50 percent, was given a grade of F.</p>\n<p>Conservative Review’s scores are sometimes cited by other news publications, particularly conservative-oriented media outlets such as Breitbart and CNS News, as well as by activist groups. But the site has its critics. The Weekly Standard, a leading conservative journal, questioned Conservative Review’s methodology in an August 2017 story. The Weekly Standard article focused on Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who has been critical of President Trump at times and who received a low score from the site. “If you want to say that Jeff Flake isn’t conservative enough for your tastes, fine,” the Weekly Standard wrote. “If you want to say that he shouldn’t criticize a Republican president, that’s fine, too. But anyone who’s trotting out this ridiculous ‘Liberty Score’ as part of their explanation as to why Flake should be considered an unperson is a joke.”</p>\n<p>In response, Conservative Review published the August 2017 piece titled, “Flake News: Weekly Standard goes full CNN.” The article highlighted how The Weekly Standard writer did not reach out to Conservative Review asking for comment and defended its methodology saying, “The Liberty Score takes into account a full spectrum of votes that matter to conservatives. Comparing it, as (Jonathan) Last did, to single-issue scorecards is ridiculous. We are not a single-issue advocacy organization.”</p>\n<p>Conservative Review sometimes criticizes Republican officials and policies that its editorial staff describe as diverging from conservative goals. In a September 2018 article, Conservative Review’s senior editor wrote, “A Republican Party that was committed to its platform would have passed a stand-alone defense and homeland security bill long ago with conservative priorities. Instead, Republicans sabotaged conservatives by holding defense spending hostage…”</p>\n<p>Headlines generally reflect the content found in articles, although sometimes with overheated language. Conservative Review’s director of research, Rob Eno, writes a column titled, “WTF MSM!?” that describes itself as fighting the mainstream media. September 2018 headlines included, “Powerless, pathetic Democrats turn Kavanaugh hearing into circus,” and “Levin obliterates Obama’s latest anti-Trump tantrum point by brutal point,” linking to a commentary by site editor-in-chief Mark Levin.</p>\n<p>Because Conservative Review is clear about its conservative mission, does not regularly distort facts, and does not seek to present opinion as news, NewsGuard has determined that the site meets the standard for handling the difference between news and opinion. </p>\n<p>The site does not have a stated corrections policy, but NewsGuard found examples of corrections, clarifications, and updates published at either the top or bottom of articles, usually accompanied by “Editor’s note.” </p>\n<p>ConservativeReview.com’s associated Facebook page was the focus of controversy in July 2018 when CRTV pundit Allie Stuckey created a video titled, “Allie Grills Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.” The video, which was not published on the site, cut together footage of Stuckey asking questions that were seemingly answered by Democratic House candidate Ocasio-Cortez of New York City. Ocasio-Cortez’ responses were actually taken from an interview that had previously aired on another news outlet.</p>\n<p>Mooney told NewsGuard that the video was not intended to trick readers into believing it was real. “It’s obvious it was a mash-up video,” Mooney said, adding that Stuckey is known for parodying liberal ideas. “Her audience knows that she does satire,” he said.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site states its ownership by CRTV LLC in its FAQ section, which identifies Levin as the top editor and links to CRTV’s homepage. However, the site does not disclose who controls the LLC. “We have several investors but don’t list them as we are a private company,” Mooney told NewsGuard. </p>\n<p>The FAQ section also describes the site’s mission and methodology for determining Liberty Scores. It adds that articles represent “solely that author’s view,” and that “anything signed by the Conservative Review Editors can be taken as the position of the site.”</p>\n<p>Articles are published with author names, most of which link to short biographies that include their social media handles.</p>\n<p>There is limited advertising on the site, and it is clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>CRTV LLC was founded in 2014 by a group of “grassroots activists and former congressional staffers,” according to Executive Editor Mooney. The company’s first products, its Liberty Scores and commentary on ConservativeReview.com, launched the same year. The online publication aimed to differentiate itself from other conservative magazines by offering an alternative voice to neoconservatives and being “more grassroots focused,” Mooney said. In 2015, Levin joined the staff as editor-in-chief of ConservativeReview.com and president of CRTV, which that year added TV shows for subscribers. Its TV lineup has included shows hosted by conservative commentators and pundits such as Levin, Michelle Malkin, and Duck Dynasty personality Phil Robertson. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nMacaela Bennett\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CRTV <a href=\"https://get.crtv.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://get.crtv.com/ </a></li>\n<li>\n<p>CRTV LLC registration information <a href=\"https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_de/5524936\" target=\"_blank\">https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_de/5524936 </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li>Michelle Malkin Investigates <a href=\"https://www.crtv.com/category/michelle-malkin-investigates\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.crtv.com/category/michelle-malkin-investigates </a></li>\n<li>Conservative Review FAQ <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/faq/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.conservativereview.com/faq/ </a></li>\n<li>CRTV Launches Digital Network <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crtv-launches-digital-network-300349534.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crtv-launches-digital-network-300349534.html </a></li>\n<li>Levin: The Obama admin interfered in TWO elections, and crickets <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/news/levin-the-obama-admin-interfered-in-two-elections-and-crickets/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.conservativereview.com/news/levin-the-obama-admin-interfered-in-two-elections-and-crickets/ </a></li>\n<li>Scam PACs killed the Tea Party.
