The site is owned by Endeavor Media Group LLC, according to Eberle’s Facebook page. Endeavor is registered in Texas and lists Eberle as its president and director.</p>\n<p>The site runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site’s About Us page says “GOPUSA strives to educate, enlighten, and engage conservatives through a host of features and services including news, online discussions, commentary, and information.”</p>\n<p>Most content is provided by other news organizations, including The Associated Press, Tribune’s wire service and the conservative Washington Times newspaper, through a licensing agreement with Acquire Media. The site also publishes columns by syndicated columnists such as Ben Shapiro and David Limbaugh.</p>\n<p>The site publishes excerpts of stories from other sites, including Fox News and Daily Mail, under a “GOPUSA Staff” byline, with a link to the original article near the bottom of the GOPUSA story.</p>\n<p>GOPUSA publishes columns by Eberle a few times per week, but the site did not carry his byline from May through September 2018.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>GOPUSA’s About Us page indicates that it publishes a mix of news and opinion content, with News and Commentary labels that appear above headlines. Eberle’s columns are not explicitly labeled opinion and occasionally misstate facts.</p>\n<p>For example, an October 2018 column titled “When do we finally become a nation of Americans?” says that the so-called “caravan” of asylum seekers moving toward the U.S. southern border in October 2018 was mostly comprised of people “seeking to get in illegally.”  U.S. law allows people to seek asylum at points of entry, and Eberle wrote the column before the caravan’s members could seek to cross the border illegally or seek asylum. In the same story, Eberle wrote that “the last big wave of legal immigrants came to the United States around 1907.” Another spike in legal immigration in 1991 brought 50 percent more legal immigrants into the U.S. than the 1907 wave, according to the Migration Policy Institute.</p>\n<p>Eberle also implied, without evidence, that Democrats and “the Left” organized the caravan to influence the 2018 election. “There is certainly something sinister in the air, and this whole expedition, just weeks before the November elections, reeks of leftwing involvement,” Eberle wrote. </p>\n<p>The site sometimes publishes outside contributors’ opinion pieces in its news section.For example, GOPUSA published a story titled “How 157 million Americans can lose their health insurance” on the site’s News section in October 2018. The article was tagged “News,” despite originally running in The Washington Times’ Opinion section with an “Analysis/Opinion” label at the top of the story.  Another October 2018 GOPUSA news story ran with the headline “Michael Savage nails it: Antifa-type thugs the ‘brownshirts’ of Democrats.” The piece was labeled “Opinion” when it first ran in The Washington Times.</p>\n<p>Because the site has mislabeled opinion pieces as news and misstated facts in some opinion pieces, NewsGuard has determined that GOPUSA.com does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. NewsGuard did not receive a response to two messages sent through GOPUSA’s contact form, and an email sent to Eberle, seeking comment about its use of opinion on the site.</p>\n<p>Most posts in GOPUSA’s news section come from established news outlets with credible sourcing. </p>\n<p>NewsGuard could not locate any correction or retraction notices on GOPUSA.com that ran after May 2016. NewsGuard did not receive a response to two messages sent through GOPUSA’s contact form, and an email sent to Eberle, asking about the site’s corrections policy.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site runs the names of the outlets where syndicated content originally appeared in the form of a byline at the top of each article. The site runs excerpted articles under a “GOPUSA staff” byline. Articles by Eberle carry his byline.</p>\n<p>The site’s About Us page indicates it is not affiliated with the Republican National Committee. It also links to a biography page for Eberle, the site’s President and CEO. The site does not specifically mention Endeavor Media Group, although Eberle is clearly identified as the founder and person in charge.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are clearly differentiated from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The GOPUSA.com domain name was created in 1999.</p>\n<p>A biography page for Eberle on GOPUSA.com says he has experience as a Republican political operative. A July 2004 USA Weekend magazine article named Eberle one of five “new powerbrokers whose sites and bytes may well influence how you cast your ballot come November,” citing his work at GOPUSA.com.</p>\n<p>Eberle previously owned another news website, TalonNews.com, which made news in 2005 after its writer, James Guckert, attended White House press briefings using a pseudonym, Jeff Gannon. The New York Times reported in 2005 that it appeared Guckert “gained access [to the White House] as a fringe participant who never sought entry through the usual channels but instead returned repeatedly for temporary passes.” Guckert eventually resigned from TalonNews.com, which is no longer active.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSam Howard\n\nEdited by:\nJosh Keefe&#x26;emsp;Amy
