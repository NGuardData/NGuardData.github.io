Its president and CEO is Bradley Dean Smith, who goes by the pseudonym Bradlee Dean, a conservative minister and host of “Sons of Liberty Radio.” Dean gained notoriety in May 2011 when he implied that then-U.S. President Barack Obama was not a Christian during his opening prayer before the Minnesota House of Representatives.   </p>\n<p>Sons of Liberty reported approximately $524,000 in revenue in 2017, according to its IRS forms. Individual donors were not listed.</p>\n<p>The site is supported by advertisements, donations, and the sale of monthly memberships that encourage “Christian-Patriots to sow into a ministry that is constantly doing instead of just sitting in church pews (James 1:22). It’s time to pick up your sword, or take off the uniform!”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site publishes political news reported by other news organizations, coupled with its writers’ commentary as well as commentary from other conservative news sources. An example is an October 2018 article about a New Hampshire judge suspending a law requiring those registering to vote within 30 days of an election to present proof of residency. The Sons of Liberty article opens with the writer’s opinion on the decision: “You can call it conspiracy, and it is, if you want, but the fact of the matter is that there is a criminal element in both federal, state and local government that will do anything to advance the anti-American agenda of what political pundits call ‘the Left.’”</p>\n<p>Typical stories have included an article on the co-founder of Home Depot criticizing “socialist millennials,” and a story praising U.S. President Donald Trump for “making black America great again!”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>A disclaimer at the bottom of every page on Sonsoflibertymedia.com says the site is a “politically neutral organization.”</p>\n<p>“We believe that the Judeo-Christian ethic has provided the principles upon which this nation was founded,” the disclaimer says. “It is our belief that these principles provide not only the foundation and framework for American government and society, but are also essential to the maintenance of a fair and just society. All content is based on a Christian, Biblical world-view.”</p>\n<p>The site’s content is largely critical of liberals while praising conservatives and Donald Trump. In order to advance this perspective, the site has repeatedly pushed false claims and conspiracy theories.</p>\n<p>For example, the site published multiple false claims in October 2018 related to the mail bombs sent to Democratic politicians and CNN, including that the bomb sent to CNN was “fake” (“Alleged Pipe Bombs To Democrats &#x26; CNN Are Very Suspicious”) and that Florida suspect Cesar Sayoc’s van was “doctored” with pro-Trump, anti-Democrat stickers before “the fake bomb hoax” (“Wondered Why All Those Trump Stickers On Fake “MAGA” Bomber’s Van Were So Pristine? – Here’s Why”).</p>\n<p>In announcing the charges against Sayoc on Oct. 26, 2018, FBI Director Christopher Wray said “these are not hoax devices.” Several media outlets, including the New York Times, Washington Post, and Miami Herald all interviewed Floridians who recalled seeing the van covered with stickers before the bombs were mailed.</p>\n<p>The site has repeatedly spread false claims that mass shootings have been staged. A March 2018 article called the high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, a “false flag attack” (“Soros, Bloomberg &#x26; Planned Parenthood Funding David Hogg’s Anti-Gun Student Protests.”) A September 2018 article falsely claimed that Parkland-survivor-turned-gun-control-activist Emma Gonzalez is a “professional actress.” The basis for the latter claim is a profile on a casting website for a “Emma Jane Gonzalez,” which belonged to 31-year-old woman living in New York who had no connection to the Parkland shooting, according to a May 2018 story by the Washington Post.</p>\n<p>Other examples of false claims made by the site include an assertion that President Obama’s birth certificate was “fraudulent” and that he was born in Kenya (July 2018’s “Obama Rubs America’s Nose In It From Kenya: ‘I’m The First Sitting American President To Come From Kenya’”).</p>\n<p>The site also hints at conspiracies without providing any evidence to back the claim. For example, an October 2018 story reported that Sayoc, the pipe bomb suspect, was a DJ at the same Florida strip club where adult film actress Stormy Daniels -- who has alleged she had a sexual relationship with President Trump -- performed in April. The site uses this connection to ask if Sayoc and Daniels “are involved in a false flag operation to destroy President Trump? Shouldn’t that possibility at least be investigated?” The story cites a Townhall.com article which was later edited to remove what Townhall editors called “a sentence that hinted at a baseless conspiracy, falling short of our standards.”</p>\n<p>Sonsoflibertymedia.com has also cited stories from sites NewsGuard has found to publish false information, such as ZeroHedge.com, NaturalNews.com, JihadWatch.org and GellerReport.com.</p>\n<p>Because of the site’s promotion of unfounded or debunked conspiracy theories and the use of unreliable sources, NewsGuard has determined it has repeatedly published false information and fails to gather and present information responsibly.</p>\n<p>The site has a separate “commentary” category. In practice, however, there is little discernible difference between news and commentary. Each article on the site includes a disclaimer: “The opinions expressed in each article are the opinions of the author alone and do not necessarily reflect those of SonsOfLibertyMedia.com.”</p>\n<p>In an example of the site’s intermingling of news and opinion, an October 2018 story titled “CNN’s Jim Acosta Has Audacity To Demand White House Name ‘Fake News Media’ – Gets Put In His Place” is tagged as a featured news story, but contains numerous statements of opinion criticizing CNN, including, “Yes, CNN is most definitely an enemy of the people! There I said it!” Another October 2018 article tagged “featured news” ran with the headline “Obama: ‘Nobody In My Administration Got Indicted,’” and called Obama the “usurper-in-chief.” The article claimed “there is no doubt that his administration was arguably the most corrupt that America has ever seen.”</p>\n<p>The site’s headlines regularly include the same false information as the articles. For example, headlines from October 2018 propagated the false claim that mail bombs sent to Democratic politicians and CNN were part of an anti-Trump “false flag” conspiracy. They include: “Wondered Why All Those Trump Stickers On Fake ‘MAGA’ Bomber’s Van Were So Pristine? – Here’s Why,” “While Media Promotes ‘Fake Trump Supporter’ As Bomber — Left-Winger in Wisconsin Attempts Purchase of Radioactive Material With Intent to Kill,” and “5 Bizarre Facts About Cesar Sayoc &#x26; His Fake Pipe Bomb Scare That Are Making Americans Shout ‘False Flag.’”</p>\n<p>The site does not post a corrections policy and NewsGuard could find no examples of corrections after 2015, including on the false stories mentioned above.</p>\n<p>In a telephone call with NewsGuard, Dean declined to answer questions about the site’s editorial policies and said he would forward an email NewsGuard sent with questions to his attorney. He also said, “I already did some homework on you and I know you’re George Soros-funded, so what is it that you need from me?”</p>\n<p>Soros, a billionaire philanthropist that funds liberal causes through his Open Society Foundations, is not an investor in NewsGuard. The full list of NewsGuard’s actual investors are available on the NewsGuard website: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.newsguardtech.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1549583547650000\" style=\"color:inherit;text-decoration:inherit\">www.newsguardtech.com</a>.</p>\n<p>“You’re bullying,” Dean said. “I don’t like your tone, I don’t like your propaganda. I don’t like who’s funding you, and if you have an issue with us, govern yourself accordingly. That’s all I’m telling you.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site makes it clear that Dean is in charge. His name appears in the banner logo on every page. The site’s About page provides a biography, along with a summary of his political and religious views. However, the site does not explicitly state that Dean or his organization own it. Sons of Liberty Media is listed in the copyright notice at the bottom of the page.</p>\n<p>Articles are generally credited to authors, with biographies typically included at the bottom of articles. There are some exceptions where no biographical information is provided, such as when the article is being shared from another site, but the site typically includes a prominent link to the original source. Advertisements are distinguishable from news articles.</p>\n<p>In a phone call with NewsGuard, Dean declined to answer questions about the site’s lack of ownership disclosure.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Dean’s ministry was founded as You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International in 2008. According to filings with the state of Minnesota, the name was changed to Sons of Liberty in September 2013. The domain name was registered in March 2011.</p>\n<p>The site’s About page discusses the history of the Sons of Liberty, a group of colonists formed in Boston before the American Revolution who believed that they should not be taxed without their consent.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label gave the incorrect date for the website’s domain registration. It was registered in March 2011.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJohn Gregory\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a
