Forward Publishing corporate records list the company’s manager as Farris C. Wilks, a pastor and billionaire who, along with his brother Dan, made a fortune in the fracking industry. </p>\n<p>Forward Publishing LLC is based in Cisco, Texas, the Wilks’ hometown. Wilks Brothers has donated millions of dollars to conservative causes including $15 million to a Super PAC backing Republican Senator Ted Cruz during his 2016 presidential campaign. The brothers also gave $1.5 million to Liberty Counsel, a nonprofit that aided Kentucky court clerk Kim Davis when she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.</p>\n<p>Ben Shapiro, the site’s editor-in-chief, is a conservative commentator with several popular political podcasts and a combined following of over 5 million on Facebook and Twitter. Shapiro joined the conservative site Breitbart in 2012 as editor-at-large, and left in 2016, resigning in protest after a Breitbart reporter said she was assaulted by a Trump aide.</p>\n<p>Dailywire.com runs advertisements and sponsored content. A premium subscription offers an ad-free version of the site, as well as video access to the site’s podcasts, including the Ben Shapiro Show. Tickets to live recordings of the Ben Shapiro Show are also available for purchase on the site.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Daily Wire features news and opinion on political issues that are widely debated on social media and online, including the Trump administration, immigration, gun control, race relations,  and LGBTQ issues. The site generally relies on reporting from other news organizations and social media posts, although it sometimes conducts original interviews, which are marked “EXCLUSIVE.”</p>\n<p>The stories adopt largely conservative positions, either with opinion pieces that appear as lead stories, frequently written by Shapiro, or with opinion inserted by writers about breaking news. Recent stories include “Trump: 'Obama Was A Patsy For Russia,' And Here's Proof,” “Criminal Illegal Alien Deported 11 Times Attacked Woman With Chainsaw, ICE Says,” “School District Refuses To Permit Parents To See LGBT Videos Students Were Forced To Watch.” Headlines are often hyperbolic, with capitalized words and exclamation points: “KABOOM! U.S. Economy Explodes with 4.1 Percent Growth Rate.” </p>\n<p>The Daily Wire does not describe its conservative perspective on the site. Its Facebook page, however, offers this mission statement: “Our goal is simple: unmask leftists in the media for who they are, destroy their credibility with the American public, and devastate their funding bases.” Accordingly, it includes frequent, critical stories on news media coverage. </p>\n<p>The site also includes a Podcast page, with videos for subscribers and audio versions for non-subscribers, and an Events page, allowing visitors to buy tickets to live recordings of Shapiro’s podcast.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility </h3>\n<p>Much of Daily Wire’s content is based on the fact-based accounts of other, credible news sources, and sometimes, exclusive interviews.</p>\n<p>However, The Daily Wire includes opinion pieces in the News category, and news stories generally contain the writer’s own opinions. Some contain the name of the author in the headline (such as “WALSH: We Could Reclaim The Culture If We Had Even A Tiny Bit Of Courage”), indicating that these are opinion pieces. Daily Wire opinion pieces by the site’s editor, Shapiro, do not contain this label and all of the pieces are widely shared as news. Shapiro’s pieces that run prominently on the home page, for example, “Trump's Triumph or Kim's Coup?” (June 2018) or “Twitter Argues It’s Not Shadowbanning Conservatives...And Accidentally Admits It’s Shadowbanning Conservatives” (July 2018) were not labeled as such. </p>\n<p>Although the Daily Wire generally presents Trump in a positive light, Shapiro has been notably critical of the president. For example, in a February 2016 video on the site titled “Donald Trump is a Liar,” Shapiro gave examples of how “Trump hasn’t been consistently conservative on a single policy position in his entire career.”</p>\n<p>Dailywire.com generally links to the sources within articles. However, its reporters sometimes include inaccurate information that is not coming from that source. For example, a June 2018 article (“Germans Are Rethinking Their Immigration Policies After The Murder of A 14-Year-Old Girl”) contains several reporting errors. The article cites a New York Times story as its source, yet at one point includes a quote (“dismissed by other states”) that does not appear in the Times story. The article also references the “rash of sexual assaults rocked the capital city of Berlin during New Years celebrations,” when in fact these assaults happened in Cologne. Finally, the story attributes the headline, “If he had been deported, she would still be alive” to Der Spiegel, when it in fact appeared in Bild, a different German newspaper. A July 2018 article “The Left’s Trump Card On Kavanaugh: HE’S A WHITE MALE!” reported that “leftists from late-night to the NY Daily news are all saying that Brett Kavanaugh is just 50 shades too white for the SCOTUS job.” However, the two news organizations cited in the article, the New York Daily News and Refinery29, did not address Kavanaugh’s race or gender. Instead, both outlets criticized the fact that a list released by the White House of 34 members of Congress expressing support for Kavanaugh included only white men.</p>\n<p>The Daily Wire sometimes publishes corrections that appear in italics above or below the article. However, in several instances where the site published incorrect information and disproven stories, the site did not issue corrections. For example, a July 2018 story \"UNREAL: Watch Liberals Protest ICE As The Agency Breaks Up A Child Sex-Trafficking Ring” was debunked by the San Francisco Chronicle five days later. The National Review, the Federalist, and the Oakland Police Department, which had published an erroneous press release and tweet on a child sex trafficking ring, all published prompt corrections on the matter. The Daily Wire has not issued a correction, as of late August 2018. Another July 2018 article, “DNC Chair Perez, Who Loves Socialist Candidates, Spotted Carrying $1,800 Travel Bag,” cited the Daily Caller as its source. The story was speculative, based on a photo of Perez and a bag. The Daily Caller issued a correction in italics stating, “After publication, the DNC replied that the bag belongs to a staffer. The article has been updated to include those comments.” The Daily Wire did not issue a correction or update its article.</p>\n<p>Because the site does not have a stated corrections policy and only selectively publishes corrections, NewsGuard has determined that the Daily Wire does not meet its standard for regularly correcting or clarifying errors. And Daily Wire’s publication of unlabeled opinion as news has led NewsGuard to conclude it does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. The Daily Wire and Shapiro did not respond to three NewsGuard messages seeking comment about its editorial practices, its use of opinion in stories and corrections practices.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site’s Authors page lists the names of all its editors, reporters, and contributors, sometimes providing either biographical information or a Twitter handle, as well as the writers’ work. The Authors page also provides a link to Shapiro’s profile, which makes clear that he is in charge. The Contact Us page provides a general web form for questions.</p>\n<p>Sponsored content and advertisements are clearly labeled. The site discloses its relationship to Forward Publishing in its Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, but does not reveal that the company is owned by the Wilks brothers. NewsGuard’s three messages to The Daily Wire and Shapiro seeking comment on ownership disclosure did not receive a response.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Shapiro founded the Daily Wire in 2015 with investment from the Wilks Brothers. Forward Publishing, LLC was registered in 2015. Forward Publishing registered “The Daily Wire” as a trademark in 2016.</p>\n<p>Shapiro serves as the site’s editor in chief and is also a frequent contributor. Shapiro’s Facebook and Twitter accounts have over 5 million combined followers, while the Daily Wire’s accounts have close to 2 million. Like the Wilks brothers, Shapiro supported Cruz’s presidential bid. An Orthodox Jew who regularly criticizes anti-Israel stances in the media, Shapiro has been the target of widespread anti-semitism on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Shapiro resigned from Breitbart in 2016 along with reporter Michelle Fields, who said that she had been roughed up by Trump’s then-campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, at a campaign event. Breitbart initially reported the incident in a way that cast doubt on Fields’ account. Shapiro said that the site ran a “poorly-evidenced conspiracy theory” that Fields had misidentified Lewandowski, and that Bannon was a “bully, and has sold out Andrew (Breitbart)’s mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump.”</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Yemile
