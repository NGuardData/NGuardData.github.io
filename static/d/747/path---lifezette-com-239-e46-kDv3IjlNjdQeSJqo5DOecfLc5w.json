In January 2018, the site was acquired by KG Airco Inc., a subsidiary of the Katz Group, one of the largest private companies in Canada with holdings in media, real estate, and other sectors. LifeZette runs advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>LifeZette publishes original written and video content on politics, parenting, health, faith, and pop culture, written with what the site describes as “an emphasis on traditional, conservative values.” Headlines range from “Yet Another Liberal Gives Yet Another Anti-Trump Commencement Speech” to “Five Other Heinous Illegal Alien Crimes You Didn’t Hear About This Week.” Stories exhibit a conservative slant in content and coverage, covering topics that portray conservatives positively and depict Democrats and liberal politics in a negative light.</p>\n<p>The site’s FaithZette section reports news from a conservative Christian perspective on abortion, homosexuality, and other issues. A May 2018 story headlined “Ex-Homosexuals, Free Speech Advocates Join Forces Against New Law,” for instance, referenced an individual’s “liberation from homosexuality.”</p>\n<p>LifeZette’s lifestyle-oriented sections can also be framed around political issues and controversies.The site’s parenting section (“MomZette”), for example, in August 2018 included an article titled, “Illegal Alien Who’d Been Deported Earlier Is Accused of Killing Minnesota Woman.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the site was found to have published misinformation by multiple publications and fact-checking sites. In October 2016, a LifeZette video titled “Clinton Body Count” suggested that several people had been murdered over the years because they challenged Bill and Hillary Clinton. The video provided no evidence for these claims, according to multiple news outlets, and NewsGuard independently confirmed that finding. LifeZette responded to criticism of the video by saying that “[t]he video was made in jest, and merely noted that the theories [about the Clintons having played a role in the death of various individuals] existed.” The grave tone of the video’s narrator and its ominous background music, however, convey a serious impression rather than a humorous or satirical one.</p>\n<p>According to the Chicago Tribune, another video, posted on Lifezette two weeks before the election, “promoted false claims that voting machines in 16 states could be compromised because they were linked to a company tied to liberal activist George Soros.” LifeZette also published a story in October 2016 headlined “Concern Grows Over Soros-Linked Voting Machines” that made the same allegations. NewsGuard independently confirmed that these claims were not supported by evidence.</p>\n<p>LifeZette’s more recent content does not include false and conspiratorial content, and, while coming from a sharp point of view, is generally fact-based and relies on credible sources. NewsGuard has therefore determined that the site does not now repeatedly publish false news and does not fall below the standard for gathering and reporting news responsibly. </p>\n<p>Some LifeZette articles distort or cherry pick facts to advance authors’ opinions, which is why NewsGuard has determined that the site does not responsibly handle the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<p>A June 2018 story, for example, was headlined “D’Souza Prosecuted as Revenge for Anti-Obama Movie.” In 2014, Dinesh D’Souza, a conservative commentator, pleaded guilty to making $20,000 worth of illegal campaign donations. He claimed that his prosecution was due to a political grudge by Obama and his administration, as punishment for an anti-Obama film D’Souza wrote and co-directed in 2012. The LifeZette headline presents D’Souza’s claim of unfair prosecution as factual, but Judge Richard Berman, who presided over D’Souza’s case, ruled that there is “no evidence of discriminatory effect nor of discriminatory purpose” in D’Souza’s prosecution. (D’Souza was pardoned by President Trump in May 2018.)</p>\n<p>A July 2018 story titled “Trump Boom Hits 4.1 Percent Growth Rate in Second Quarter” referenced “the December 2017 tax cuts, which were the biggest in U.S. history.” The story is referring to a tax bill signed by the president in December 2017, and Trump himself has repeatedly claimed it was the largest tax cut in history. However, there is no backing for that claim. According to several independent assessments, the tax cut was the eighth largest since 1918, when measured as a percentage of GDP, which is the method used by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to compare tax cuts and increases. When measured in inflation-adjusted dollars, another common means of comparison, President Trump’s plan is the fourth largest tax cut since 1918.</p>\n<p>A January 2018 story headlined “Our Kids Are Being Taught They’re Flawed if They’re White” also made unsubstantiated claims. The story said: “Today, whites are largely responsible for the day-to-day commerce of this country. Many black teenagers hold themselves back, in contrast, by deliberately rejecting the values on which this country was founded.” The story did not provide evidence or a source for these claims.</p>\n<p>The site’s About page says LifeZette “quickly and carefully post[s] corrections on any errors of content” and instructs readers to send suggested corrections to an email address provided. Although a few stories on the site contain editor’s notes with updates, NewsGuard could not find any examples of corrections on the site, and none of the stories referenced above that contain factual errors have were corrected as of July 2018.</p>\n<p>Managing editor Maureen Mackey and senior editor Mark Tapscott did not respond to two emails requesting information about how the site handles corrections and the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Sponsored articles are attributed to the site’s “Sponsor Content Team” and are labeled with the heading “Sponsor Content” at the top of each article.</p>\n<p>LifeZette previously had a Meet Our Editors page (which contained profiles of editors, some including Twitter handles), but this section is no longer visible on the site as of August 2018. Articles usually give the names of writers, with bios and often email addresses or social media handles included at the bottom of articles. </p>\n<p>LifeZette’s Contact Us page does not provide a way to contact the editorial team or send feedback to the site aside from a general contact form.</p>\n<p>The site does not disclose information about its ownership, and removed a reference to KG Airco in its copyright statement in May 2018.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard sent three emails to LifeZette’s media team about the site’s lack of disclosure about its ownership and did not receive a reply.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site was launched in 2015. In January 2017, LifeZette garnered media attention when Sean Spicer, then the White House Press Secretary, called on a LifeZette reporter first at the White House daily press briefing. His choice was deemed controversial by news organizations and journalism experts, as the first organization called on for questions in White House briefings is traditionally a large, well-established news provider.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nNina Zweig\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
