Smith wrote on En-Volve.com, under the pen name A. Michael Smith, that he \"started enVolve during the campaign of 2016 to rally Conservatives and Independents around the Republican Presidential candidate because I believed the country could not afford a Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders Presidency.\"</p>\n<p>The website runs advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>EnVolve covers political news, primarily providing favorable coverage of conservatives and negative stories about Democrats. The site occasionally posts stories about business, entertainment, and crime. Most articles are lifted from conservative websites and blogs, including Breitbart, the Daily Signal, and the Western Journal. </p>\n<p>The site posts some original content, produced by its own staff of writers as well as by users who are allowed to publish submissions through a link on the site. Stories written by EnVolve staff or contributors usually present a short summary of news reports with some political commentary. Users are encouraged to downvote or upvote stories, using positive or negative emoticons of President Trump’s face.</p>\n<p>Coverage in late 2018 largely featured news about the Trump administration, the “migrant caravan” approaching U.S. borders, and the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Critical stories about Democrats, including former president Barack Obama and Bill and HIllary Clinton, and incoming U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, were also prominent, as well as stories criticizing CNN.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>EnVolve has published false news, hoaxes, and satirical content from news sources that are known to publish false content. In February 2017, for example, the site posted a false news story claiming that former U. S. President Barack Obama planned to build a secret bunker in Washington to take down Trump's presidency. The article was republished from Freedom Daily, a now-defunct conspiracy website. The fact-checking website Snopes.com reported that the story was loosely based on a false story from unreliable news source InfoWars.com, which said that Obama was planning to bring an army of 30,000 soldiers to the White House. </p>\n<p>The site has posted many hoaxes and satirical content from its sister website Empire News without disclosing that the articles were fabricated. In October 2016, for example, EnVolve posted a false Empire News story claiming that actress Betty White had died. White, who was born in 1922, was still alive in late 2018. In June 2018, it published another hoax asserting that Harvey Weinstein was \"reportedly attacked, raped in prison while awaiting sentencing.\"</p>\n<p>The articles have not been removed or corrected on the site, which is why NewsGuard has determined that En-Volve.com has repeatedly published false content and does not gather and present information responsibly.</p>\n<p>When asked about its editorial process, Smith told NewsGuard that the site posts mostly curated content. \"We can't always confirm the veracity of curated content though we try to pull from sources we deem reliable,\" Smith said. </p>\n<p>The stories on the site are not labeled as either news or opinion, but most stories are heavily opinionated, which is why NewsGuard has determined the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. Typical headlines on the site in late 2018 include  \"George Soros May Finally Be Facing Karma – ‘Explosive Device’ Discovered At Liberal’s NY Home,” \"No Surprise! The Only Thing The Unethical Democrats Have Worked On Since The Elections Is Trying To Impeach Trump,\" and “As If We Needed Another Reason Not to Want Them Here, Mexican Officials Say Caravan Members Have AIDS and TB.”</p>\n<p>The site does not clearly disclose an ideology or mission statement, although one of its content sections is called “Conservative Headlines.”</p>\n<p>Smith did not respond to questions about how his website separates news from opinion, but said that the site posts original opinion pieces. “They will mostly be op-ed submitted by contributors. Opinion pieces will also cite sources of relevant news or facts if referenced,\" Smith said.</p>\n<p>EnVolve often publishes misleading and sensational headlines. A November 2018 article was titled “OUCH: Larry King Agrees His Former Network, CNN, Is Now FAKE NEWS.” Although the story quoted King criticizing the network, it made no mention of King calling CNN “fake news.” In October 2018, the site published the headline \"NYC Starts New Public Campaign Telling Christians, Conservatives, And Trump Supporters Are NOT WELCOME,\" which conveyed the false impression that the city of New York was responsible for discriminatory flyers posted in public places. The story said that the city had nothing to do with the anonymous artwork. </p>\n<p>The site does not run corrections and does not have a corrections policy posted online.</p>\n<p>Smith’s reply to NewsGuard’s inquiries on its editorial process did not address the site’s headlines or corrections procedures.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>EnVolve does not disclose that it is owned by Aaron Smith. Readers can submit messages and comments to the website via a contact form, but the site does not provide any information about its content creators or editors, nor does it have an About page. Articles written by staff and freelance writers include the name of the author. </p>\n<p>Smith did not respond to questions about the website’s lack of disclosure of its owners and editors and lack of information about content creators.</p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored content are clearly distinguished from news content, with the words \"Ads\" or \"Sponsored.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>EnVolve was founded in April 2016, according to website registration records. Smith previously created and published EmpireSports.co, a now-defunct satirical sports website. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSophia Tewa\n\nEdited by:\nSarah Brandt&#x26;emsp;Amy
