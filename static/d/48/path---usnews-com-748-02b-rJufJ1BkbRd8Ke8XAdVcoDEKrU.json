Zuckerman co-founded the real estate company Boston Properties Inc. and previously owned The Atlantic, Fast Company, and New York Daily News.</p>\n<p>In addition to its site, U.S. News &#x26; World Report publishes numerous annual print and electronic books of rankings and consumer advice, including “Best Colleges,” “Best Graduate Schools,” and “Best Hospitals.” The site runs advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>U.S. News &#x26; World Report primarily provides coverage of politics, education, finance, and health. Sections feature a mix of news, advice columns, and other topic-specific resources. The Civic section features reporting on public health and policy issues, such as the opioid crisis and disease outbreaks, as well as coverage of national and international news. Civic also includes rankings of “Best States” and “Best Countries,” based on metrics the company has developed on health care, cultural influence, and overall quality of life.</p>\n<p>The Education section primarily provides advice for college and graduate school applicants. In addition to rankings, the site lists the test requirements for online degrees and offers suggestions on how to manage student debt. It also features rankings of U.S. high schools and of universities worldwide.</p>\n<p>The site provides financial resources, with advice on basic investing and refinancing home mortgages, as well as a podcast called The Best of Wealth of Knowledge. The Health section includes guides to diseases and medical conditions, as well as health and wellness resources. Other content covers travel, cars, and real estate. U.S. News also provides directories of law firms and lawyers.</p>\n<p>The site publishes content from The Associated Press.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>U.S. News does original, fact-based reporting and often cites information and data from reputable organizations such as the nonpartisan Pew Research Center and other news organizations, including The Washington Post and National Public Radio. Headlines accurately reflect the content.</p>\n<p>The site does not have a dedicated opinion section, but headlines typically indicate whether a story contains opinion or commentary.</p>\n<p>USNews.com does not state a corrections policy, but NewsGuard found that the site regularly runs corrections, generally noted at the bottom of stories. </p>\n<p>U.S. News &#x26; World Report won National Magazine Awards in 1991, for feature writing, and in 2001, for general excellence online.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site names its authors and typically provides information about them, such as a biography, contact information, and links to social media pages. The site’s masthead lists the names of editorial staff, but provides no contact or biographical information for site leaders or others.</p>\n<p>Brian Kelly, U.S. News editor and chief content officer, told NewsGuard in an email in early February 2019 that a page with profiles of senior staff and contributors was “in the works.”</p>\n<p>U.S. News’ ownership is disclosed on the site’s About page. Advertising is clearly distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>U.S. News &#x26; World Report traces its origin to a weekly newspaper called the United States News, which was founded by journalist David Lawrence in 1933. In 1962, U.S. News &#x26; World Report became an employee-owned company. For many years, it was considered a more conservative newsweekly counterpart to Time and Newsweek, and did substantial general reporting, notably in Washington. Its “Washington Whispers” column, meant to be insider news about the capital, was a mainstay.</p>\n<p>The company launched its education rankings in 1983, and Zuckerman bought the company in 1984. Over the years, the magazine cut back on its frequency and narrowed its editorial focus. It eliminated the print edition in 2010, and in 2018, it eliminated its Washington-based opinion section. Critics have regularly questioned the methodology of its college rankings, but they remain influential.</p>\n<p>USNews.com was launched in 1995.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: NewsGuard Executive Editor Jim Warren wrote commentary for U.S. News &#x26; World Report for two years and is a long-time friend of chief content officer Kelly.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan
