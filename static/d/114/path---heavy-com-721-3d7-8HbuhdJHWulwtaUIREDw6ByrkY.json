The partners also own ahoramismo.com,  a Spanish-language site that started in 2015 with a focus similar to Heavy’s. The sites are headquartered in New York City.</p>\n<p>Heavy.com attracted two rounds of funding from Polaris Partners, $12.8 million in 2006 and $20 million in 2007.  The website also derives revenue from direct advertising and affiliate programs.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Heavy.com’s homepage is a scroll of breaking news headlines, and staff stories that are based on other news outlets’ reporting. Stories on crimes, violence and sex typically generate the headlines on the homepage, such as “Man Plotted to Blow Himself Up On Election Day,” “Model Shot in Neck While Driving in Georgia,” and “New Jersey Teacher Accused of Sending Nude Photos to Her Student.”</p>\n<p>Most stories come from more established outlets such as NBC, The Hill, and BuzzFeed News, and are then given Heavy’s “Five Fast Facts…” treatment. After one or two introductory paragraphs, a story becomes a bullet-point list of what the user needs to know about the person or event, along with embedded videos and social media posts. Other sections include tech, gaming, and “More From Heavy,” which is a melange of popular culture, quirky news and “Ten Best” product lists. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Heavy.com writers attribute their information to reliable news outlets and verified social media accounts. Their stories and headlines are fact-based and straightforward distillations. The site regularly corrects factual errors with notations at the bottom of stories explaining the error.</p>\n<p>The site publishes detailed editorial guidelines, committing to objective coverage, attributing sources and forbidding reporters from accepting gifts in exchange for coverage.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site contains a lengthy list of writers and editors, with their email addresses and Twitter handles.  Bylined stories contain a link to a reporter biography and contact information.  Ownership is stated in the Editorial Guidelines section.  </p>\n<p>Heavy.com participates in the Trust Project (thetrustproject.org), in which news organizations commit to follow specific guidelines related to transparency.</p>\n<p>Sponsored content is mixed liberally with more traditional posts, but is labeled. Most of the sponsored content appears as “10 Best” lists of products, typically written by a Heavy staffer with experience reviewing the product. “10 Best” lists are appended with a disclaimer disclosing the site participates in Amazon’s affiliate advertising program, which allows it to earn revenue by linking users to Amazon. “Our product recommendations are guided solely by our editors. We have no relationship with manufacturers,” the site says.                </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site has been owned by web entrepreneurs Simon Assaad and David Carson since 1999. Heavy.com initially produced online scripted videos, including the reality show D-Life and shows Heavy Petting and The Jimmy Show. Assaad later expanded into other online entertainment ventures, including AOL Music and the Fuse network.</p>\n<p>The site was rebranded in 2009 as a news site.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nStephanie Gutmann\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Joan Nassivera&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Interview with managing editor Ben Doody on 7/10/18</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gigaom.com/2006/09/26/heavycom-sale-rumors-arent-true-founders/\" target=\"_blank\">https://gigaom.com/2006/09/26/heavycom-sale-rumors-arent-true-founders/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/polaris-partners/investments/investments_list#section-investments\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/polaris-partners/investments/investments_list#section-investments</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gigaom.com/2006/09/26/heavycom-sale-rumors-arent-true-founders/\" target=\"_blank\">https://gigaom.com/2006/09/26/heavycom-sale-rumors-arent-true-founders/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2017/03/heavy_com_five_fast_facts_you_need_to_know.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2017/03/heavy<em>com</em>five<em>fast</em>facts<em>you</em>need<em>to</em>know.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gigaom.com/2008/10/17/419-more-layoffs-heavycom-shedding-12-more-employees\" target=\"_blank\">https://gigaom.com/2008/10/17/419-more-layoffs-heavycom-shedding-12-more-employees</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=25523458&privcapId=718452\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=25523458&#x26;privcapId=718452</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonassaad/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonassaad/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/02/business/fi-heavy2\" target=\"_blank\">http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/02/business/fi-heavy2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.spanishdict.com/answers/150645/ahora-vs.-ahorita-vs.-ahora-mismo\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.spanishdict.com/answers/150645/ahora-vs.-ahorita-vs.-ahora-mismo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vcgate.com/HEAVY.com-Secures-20-Million-from-Polaris-Venture-Partners.asp\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.vcgate.com/HEAVY.com-Secures-20-Million-from-Polaris-Venture-Partners.asp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://heavy.com/tech/2018/10/best-wireless-soundbar/\" target=\"_blank\">https://heavy.com/tech/2018/10/best-wireless-soundbar/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://heavy.com/entertainment/2018/10/roseanne-the-conners-death-dead-killed-off/\" target=\"_blank\">https://heavy.com/entertainment/2018/10/roseanne-the-conners-death-dead-killed-off/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://heavy.com/news/2018/10/horseface-stormy-daniels/\" target=\"_blank\">https://heavy.com/news/2018/10/horseface-stormy-daniels/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://heavy.com/news/2018/10/dunkin-donuts-hamdia-ahmed/\" target=\"_blank\">https://heavy.com/news/2018/10/dunkin-donuts-hamdia-ahmed/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://heavy.com/news/2018/10/pedro-hernandez/\" target=\"_blank\">https://heavy.com/news/2018/10/pedro-hernandez/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/prince-haywood-nelson-brothers/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/prince-haywood-nelson-brothers/</a>  </li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"heavy.com","author":"Stephanie Gutmann","date":"2018-10-18T17:28:48.431+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/heavy.com/"}}
