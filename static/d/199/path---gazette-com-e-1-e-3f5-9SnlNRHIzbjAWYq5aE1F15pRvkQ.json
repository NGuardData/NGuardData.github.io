Clarity also owns The Weekly Standard magazine and the Washington Examiner newspaper.</p>\n<p>Clarity Media Group is owned by Anschutz Corporation, which is controlled by billionaire Philip Anschutz, who built fortunes in the fossil fuel, railroad, telecom, and entertainment industries and has invested heavily in wind energy. Anschutz owns stakes in professional sports teams, the Staples Center in Los Angeles, the Coachella music festival, and vacation resorts.</p>\n<p>Anschutz donated more than $600,000 to Republican candidates and committees in the 2016 election cycle. His foundation, the Anschutz Foundation, has given money to a variety of conservative political groups, including the pro-business American Legislative Exchange Council, the Koch brothers’ Americans for Prosperity, anti-marijuana legalization groups, and The Federalist Society, a conservative legal group that has shaped President Donald Trump’s nominations for the federal bench.</p>\n<p>Anschutz has also given to groups that critics have alleged are anti-LGBTQ, although he has denied any bias and also donated $1 million to the Elton John AIDS Foundation in response to the criticism.</p>\n<p>Gazette.com runs advertisements and sells subscriptions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Gazette covers politics, crime, business, and news specific to the Colorado Springs area. The site has robust coverage of the military, including the Fort Carson Army base and the Air Force Academy, both located near Colorado Spring in El Paso County. The site has sections devoted to wildfires and the marijuana industry, as well as education and Colorado politics. The Gazette’s editors have said the publication uses a digital-first philosophy that breaks news with alerts and a few paragraphs of breaking news online, and then builds the story throughout the day.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the site’s coverage of national and world news comes from The Associated Press. Gazette.com also publishes content from its news partner, local television station KKTV 11. The Gazette also links to related sites that focus on entertainment, the outdoors, and high school sports.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Gazette reporters conduct original reporting using authoritative and primary sources. Corrections run at the bottom of stories. Headlines accurately reflect the content of articles.</p>\n<p>The Gazette has won two Pulitzer Prizes, in 2014 for national reporting about wounded veterans, and in 1990 for feature writing about a family’s recovery after an explosion.</p>\n<p>Opinion columns are generally labeled as such.</p>\n<p>However, in 2015, Gazette.com published a four-part series “Clearing the Haze” that claimed to “examine health, social, regulatory and financial issues associated with the world’s boldest experiment with legal marijuana.” While the series was produced to look like an investigation reported by the paper’s news staff, it was written by two editorial board members, as well as a freelancer who is an opponent of legalization and who is married to an anti-marijuana addiction specialist quoted in the series. The articles in the series were described as “Op-eds” and listed the “reporting team” at the bottom of the articles, but did not disclose the freelancer’s views. The freelancer’s relationship to her husband was mentioned after he was first quoted in the series, but not in subsequent articles.</p>\n<p>The Gazette’s publisher, Dan Steever, told Columbia Journalism Review in a 2015 article that “because we’ve been so vocal on the editorial pages we thought, well, we have a point of view on this so we’re going to do this as a perspective piece. And perspective to us means, yeah, we have a perspective, but we’re going to use hard facts, and we’re going to use real reporting to report...We state who did it, how we did it. We call it a perspective piece. I think we’ve done a pretty good job of telling people this is what we’re doing and why. The introduction piece kind of says we don’t think the reporting has been told and balanced and we’re going to take a different perspective on this. I don’t think the way we did it changes the data. The data is the data. Now the data doesn’t come to a conclusion, we don’t draw a conclusion.”  </p>\n<p>The Gazette’s failure to clearly identify the series as either opinion or an investigation, and the decision to quote an activist married to one of its writers, would normally cause NewsGuard to determine it does not gather and present information responsibly. But NewsGuard found the series was an exception to the newspaper’s fair and accurate reporting and transparent practices in 2018.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site lists author names in stories. An Authors section contains short biographies of writers and editors along with links to their articles. A Contact Us page lists phone numbers and email addresses for the site’s leadership and newsroom.</p>\n<p>Gazette.com identifies Colorado Springs Gazette LLC as its owner in its legal disclosures, but does not make the information accessible in a user-friendly manner for readers. It also does not disclose its connections to Clarity Media Group and Anschutz Corporation, except when reporting on a story related to Anschutz. </p>\n<p>Gazette Editor Vince Bzdek did not return two telephone calls and two emails seeking comment on the site’s lack of ownership disclosure, and did not respond to one email seeking comment on the newspaper’s disclosure of its authors and sources in its editorial series on marijuana legalization.</p>\n<p>Advertising appears to be delineated from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Founded in 1872, the Colorado Springs Gazette is the second largest daily newspaper in the state.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nYemile Bucay\n\nEdited by:\nJosh Keefe&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://gazette.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">http://gazette.com/contact</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gazette.com/new-publisher-named-for-gazette/article/143850\" target=\"_blank\">http://gazette.com/new-publisher-named-for-gazette/article/143850</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-steever-31a42b10/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-steever-31a42b10/</a>  </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gazette.com/new-gazette-editor-vince-bzdeks-roots-run-deep-in-community-journalism/article/1573426\" target=\"_blank\">http://gazette.com/new-gazette-editor-vince-bzdeks-roots-run-deep-in-community-journalism/article/1573426</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/david-philipps\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/david-philipps</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/dave-curtin\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/dave-curtin</a>  </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gazette.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">http://gazette.com/about/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2012/11/30/anschutz-buys-colorado-springs-gazette.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2012/11/30/anschutz-buys-colorado-springs-gazette.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/clarity-colorado-politics-gazette-denver-post.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cjr.org/united<em>states</em>project/clarity-colorado-politics-gazette-denver-post.php</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2012/11/30/anschutz-corp-buys-the-gazette-in-colorado-springs/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.denverpost.com/2012/11/30/anschutz-corp-buys-the-gazette-in-colorado-springs/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=20346059\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=20346059</a></li>\n<li>News partner KKTV example -- <a href=\"http://gazette.com/deadly-crash-involving-2-vehicles-in-southeast-colorado-springs/article/1625354\" target=\"_blank\">http://gazette.com/deadly-crash-involving-2-vehicles-in-southeast-colorado-springs/article/1625354</a>  </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gazette.com/news/us-world\" target=\"_blank\">http://gazette.com/news/us-world</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gazette.com/authors\" target=\"_blank\">http://gazette.com/authors</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/your-coachella-money-is-going-to-a-right-wing-billionaire-who-funded-anti-lgbt-and-anti-marijuana-causes\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thedailybeast.com/your-coachella-money-is-going-to-a-right-wing-billionaire-who-funded-anti-lgbt-and-anti-marijuana-causes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.thefader.com/2018/01/03/coachella-philip-anschutz-anti-gay-abortion\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.thefader.com/2018/01/03/coachella-philip-anschutz-anti-gay-abortion</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://coloradopressassociation.com/news/inside-the-innovation-at-the-gazette/article_225f15da-c896-11e7-9450-33f0b1a06101.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://coloradopressassociation.com/news/inside-the-innovation-at-the-gazette/article_225f15da-c896-11e7-9450-33f0b1a06101.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/colorado_springs_gazette_marijuana.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cjr.org/united<em>states</em>project/colorado<em>springs</em>gazette_marijuana.php</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gazette.com/clearingthehaze/\" target=\"_blank\">https://gazette.com/clearingthehaze/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gazette.com/news/anschutz-foundation-pledges-cu-medical-campus-the-largest-private-gift/article_d6f9c70a-a546-11e8-aaae-330795945376.html—\" target=\"_blank\">https://gazette.com/news/anschutz-foundation-pledges-cu-medical-campus-the-largest-private-gift/article_d6f9c70a-a546-11e8-aaae-330795945376.html—</a> Anschutz disclosure example</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"gazette.com","author":"Yemile Bucay","date":"2018-11-07T03:34:32.606+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/gazette.com/"}}
