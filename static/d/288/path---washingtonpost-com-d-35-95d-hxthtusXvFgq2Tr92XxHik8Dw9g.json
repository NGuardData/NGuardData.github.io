In 2013, Donald Graham, son of the late publisher and CEO Katharine Graham, announced the sale of the Post to Jeff Bezos for a reported $250 million.</p>\n<p>The site generates revenue from advertising and online subscriptions. Users who do not purchase digital subscriptions only have access to a limited number of articles. Amazon has made special offers to its more than 100 million Prime members, including the first six months of the digital product for free. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Washington Post publishes breaking and in-depth coverage of the top national and international news of the day, as well as local news from the District of Columbia and the Maryland and Virginia metropolitan areas.</p>\n<p>After Bezos took over the Post, he brought investments in new editorial technology and personnel to the Post, expanding the newsroom to more than 750 editorial staffers (still below its Graham-era peak of 900.) The staff includes a video team of approximately 70 who produce content for multiple platforms, including its website, Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook accounts. In July 2018, it began broadcasting  political content on Twitch, a streaming platform best known for gaming, including having a political reporter interview politicians as they play video games.</p>\n<p>Shailesh Prakash is chief information officer and central to the paper’s technological innovations, including Arc, a proprietary publishing technology that assists the editorial and business sides in publishing content. Post technology tests different headlines (“content variation testing,”), uses predictive algorithms to assess a story’s prospects, and has started testing machines to write headlines. The Post created a newsletter delivery platform and an artificial intelligence system to cover and geographically customize the results of congressional and gubernatorial races on election night and of sports games. Computer engineers sit next to journalists in the newsroom and video screens display data that includes up-to-the-moment reader metrics and average online load times for stories.</p>\n<p>The website also publishes offbeat news that is widely shared on social media, and features a number of popular fixtures both online and in emailed newsletters, including the Morning Mix, a summary of what the Post calls “unexpected stories that will be the talk of the morning,” and podcasts on topics from war history to the day’s top stories.</p>\n<p>The Post and The New York Times produced many exclusive stories during the 2016 presidential campaign, often competing against each other by the minute. A Post interview prompted Donald Trump, a prominent “birther,”  to finally concede that former U.S. President Barack Obama was born in the United States, while other Post efforts revealed that Donald Trump had disclosed classified information to Russian officials, not contributed money to his own foundation since 2008, used foundation resources to settle legal claims, hung fake Time magazine covers of himself at his resorts, exaggerated his own donations to charity, and had uttered unseemly comments about women during the taping of an \"Access Hollywood” episode.  In early 2019, the Post reported that there were few detailed records of meetings between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that Trump had at least once confiscated notes from his interpreter to prevent them from being widely shared.</p>\n<p>In 2018, the site’s non-political coverage included “An Affair. The Mob. A Murder,” reporter Mary Jordan’s examination of the unsolved murder of a 46-year-old Defense Department employee that she had originally covered more than 30 years earlier. It climaxes with her confronting the man she suspects of the murder, an 84-year-old onetime bomb expert for what was then known as the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>WashingtonPost.com posts in-depth information about its reporting standards on a Policies and Standards page, leading with “The Seven Principles for the Conduct of a Newspaper,” written by one of the newspaper’s former owners, Eugene Meyer. “The first mission of a newspaper is to tell the truth as nearly as the truth may be ascertained,” the document begins.</p>\n<p>The site offers explanations of the paper’s rules on the use of anonymous sources. (President Trump has cited the use of anonymous sources as a basis for his calling The Post and other outlets “fake news.”) The policy states: “We do not promise sources that we will refrain from additional reporting or efforts to verify the information they may give us.” It also describes its standards for fact-checking and verifying information, noting that multiple editors may evaluate content, depending on how complex or sensitive the information might be. It also goes into detailed explanation of journalistic best practices, including fairness (“No story is fair if it omits facts of major importance or significance. Fairness includes completeness. … No story is fair if it covers individuals or organizations that have not been given the opportunity to address assertions or claims about them made by others.”</p>\n<p>Soon after Executive Editor Martin Baron’s arrival in 2013, the newspaper won the Pulitzer Prize for public service for revealing the National Security Agency’s surveillance program, which was based on information and data leaked by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor.</p>\n<p>In 2018 it won two Pulitzer Prizes, for disclosing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and for its coverage of the 2017 U.S. Senate race in Alabama. The latter revealed sexual misconduct allegations against the Republican candidate, Roy Moore, who lost the race. The Post has won 65 Pulitzer Prizes, trailing only The New York Times.</p>\n<p>Its coverage of the Trump campaign and presidency was and remains fierce — and the paper is regularly disparaged by President Trump as “fake news” and as the “Amazon Washington Post.” Following its reporting in early 2019 on the scant details about the president’s meetings with Putin, Trump referred to Bezos as “Jeff Bozo” in a tweet about Bezos’ recent divorce proceedings.</p>\n<p>Reporter Glenn Kessler also oversees a newsroom group that fact-checks declarations and claims of public officials.</p>\n<p>The newspaper regularly covers Bezos’ company, Amazon, including a column that chided as “Silicon Valley at its most out-of-touch” an Amazon product that can unlock Amazon Prime customers’ front doors to simplify deliveries. An examination of the company headlined “Is Amazon getting too big?” concluded, “While Amazon is not yet a threat to competition, it is well on its way to becoming one.”</p>\n<p>In 2017 the paper added the slogan, “Democracy Dies in Darkness” under its nameplate. While the motto was widely seen as a retort to President Trump, the paper insisted it decided to run a slogan before he became the Republican nominee, and was not a response to him. Bezos used it while discussing the purchase of the paper during a public appearance, and attributed the phrase to Post journalist Bob Woodward of Watergate fame, who later clarified he had taken it from a federal court decision on wiretapping years earlier. “I think a lot of us believe this, that democracy dies in darkness,” Bezos said, “that certain institutions have a very important role in making sure that there is light.”</p>\n<p>The site regularly issues corrections and clarifications, with notes attached to stories that explain the mistake and how the story has been changed. The Post says it seeks to correct stories promptly, including information in alerts. “If we have sent out incorrect information in an alert, we should send out an alert informing people that the news reported in the earlier alert was wrong and give readers the accurate information,” the policy says. A July 10, 2018, Editor’s Note conceded that the paper mistakenly used information from a piece in ClickHole, a satire site, as if it were a serious news source, in an article related to the meaning of “American Idiot,” a Broadway musical seen by Trump years before.</p>\n<p>In its Policies and Standards Section, the Post identifies four types of content that offer opinion or analysis, which includes film and restaurant reviews, opinion columns, “perspective,” which includes “discussion of news topics with a point of view,” and “analysis,” which includes features such as The Fix.</p>\n<p>While the Post has published many stories that have angered President Trump and his supporters, it also has produced stories that can be seen as favorable to the president. For example, in July 2018, other media reported that the White House had intentionally left out of an official White House transcript a reporter’s question to Putin during a joint press conference with Trump asking whether Putin wanted Trump to win the presidency. The Post reported that in fact, the question had been omitted from an audio recording of the press conference, due to technical issues, and that some news organizations had produced transcripts with the same omission.    </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Washingtonpost.com includes the names of writers on stories and posts biographies of its staff, as well as contact information for them and newsroom leaders. It runs reader responses. </p>\n<p>The Post bars its journalists from using social media to post anything on their personal accounts that could be perceived as reflecting “political, racial, sexist, religious or other bias or favoritism.”</p>\n<p>The Post no longer has an ombudsman, but reporters and columnists Paul Farhi, Sarah Ellison, Erik Wemple, and Margaret Sullivan (a former New York Times Public Editor) write extensively about the media, including The Post.</p>\n<p>The Post’s Policies and Standards page discloses its ownership by Bezos. </p>\n<p>Advertising and sponsored content are distinguishable from editorial content. The site explains its relationship to ad networks and audience segment providers who use technology to track users’ online activity and target ads for them. It explains how readers can opt out of such targeting.</p>\n<p>The Washington Post participates in the Trust Project (thetrustproject.org), in which news organizations commit to follow specific guidelines related to transparency.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The newspaper was founded in 1877 by reporter and publisher Stilson Hutchins and added a Sunday edition three years later. It moved through several owners until it was purchased by  Meyer, the former Federal Reserve chairman and Katharine Graham’s father, in 1933. </p>\n<p>The Post struggled throughout the 1940s and into the 1950s, largely because of the dominance of the conservative Washington Times-Herald and the Washington Star. It was able to buy the Times-Herald in 1954 from Colonel Robert R. McCormick, the legendary owner of The Chicago Tribune and The Times-Herald. (He was chagrined that his married niece, the publisher, was having an affair with an editor at the paper.)</p>\n<p>The combined paper morphed over time into the ideologically liberal Post, where Katharine Graham became president after her husband Phil Graham’s suicide. She ran the paper during the legal fight with the government, led by The New York Times, to publish The Pentagon Papers, a secret government history of the Vietnam War. It prompted a landmark 1971 U.S. Supreme Court decision that supported the right to publish the history,  a saga chronicled in the 2017 film “The Post,” with Graham portrayed by Meryl Streep. Graham and Executive Editor Ben Bradlee were central to the paper’s later investigation into the Watergate scandal that led to the 1974 resignation of President Richard Nixon. Its reporting team was led by Woodward and Carl Bernstein, whose story was retold in Hollywood’s “All The President’s Men.”</p>\n<p>The paper became part of a growing media enterprise under Katharine Graham, which included Newsweek and several television stations. The Post also launched its famous “Style” section in the Bradlee-Graham era, expanding a section that had been traditional women’s lifestyle content in other papers to longform writing on culture, Washington gossip, and the media.</p>\n<p>Katharine Graham handed the company reins to her son Donald, who selected his niece, Katharine Weymouth, as publisher of the paper. She picked Marcus Brauchli, from The Wall Street Journal, as editor to replace Leonard Downie Jr., Bradlee’s successor, but later replaced him with Baron. Within the year, Graham sold the newspaper to Bezos.</p>\n<p>The Post extensively covered the October 2018 murder and dismemberment in Istanbul, Turkey, of Jamal Khashoggi, a Post columnist and Saudi Arabian dissident. It carried news stories, analyses, and editorials, with one editorial calling the Saudi government’s denial of culpability as “shocking in its audacity.” The Post also published ads in print and online for months calling attention to the death. A full-page ad in December stated, “A life is gone. The principles of free expression endure,” accompanying  a photograph of Khashoggi.</p>\n<p>President Trump condemned the killing but said the death should not hurt relations between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJim Warren\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
