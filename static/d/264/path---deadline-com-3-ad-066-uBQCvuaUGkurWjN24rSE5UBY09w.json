PMC, based in Los Angeles, acquired Deadline Hollywood in 2009. The site runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site primarily produces original content about the business of the entertainment industry. Stories range from box office performances of recent movies to TV show cancellations (“‘Colony’ Canceled By USA Network After 3 Seasons”), from actors under consideration for various roles to others leaving shows (“‘Riverdale’: Penelope Ann Miller Joins Season 3 Cast Of CW Series”). The site also publishes hard news from third-party outlets on other topics, including the Trump administration. It features original interviews with actors and directors, as well as film and TV reviews.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Deadline features original reporting by experienced entertainment journalists, links to credible sources and uses headlines that accurately reflect the content. Stories frequently rely on anonymous sources, a common practice in the entertainment and gossip media industry. The site does not provide a corrections policy, and does not appear to publish corrections. Deadline did not respond to two NewsGuard emails asking about its corrections policy. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site’s “About Us” page lists biographical and contact information for Deadline’s editorial staff and general manager. Articles generally provide the writer’s name and email address. The site makes clear its affiliation to PMC, detailing the history of Deadline, its owner, and its founder. The “Got a Tip?” page provides a general web form, email address, and Santa Monica street address. Advertisements are clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Deadline Hollywood began as a weekly print column written by Nikki Finke for the newspaper LA Weekly. The online blog was launched in 2006 and was bought by PMC (then known as Mail.com Media Corp) in 2009. Finke remained editor after the sale, but left in 2013.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nTony Silber\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pmc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://pmc.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pmc.com/about-us/person/jay-penske/\" target=\"_blank\">https://pmc.com/about-us/person/jay-penske/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/nikki-finke-hollywood-blogger-gets-her-pay-day/\" target=\"_blank\">https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/nikki-finke-hollywood-blogger-gets-her-pay-day/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/jun/24/blogging-digital-media\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/jun/24/blogging-digital-media</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://deadline.com/2018/07/asia-argento-defended-from-net-bullying-on-anthony-bourdain-suicide-in-open-letter-1202426014/\" target=\"_blank\">https://deadline.com/2018/07/asia-argento-defended-from-net-bullying-on-anthony-bourdain-suicide-in-open-letter-1202426014/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/24/business/fi-ct-deadline24\" target=\"_blank\">http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/24/business/fi-ct-deadline24</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/05/nikki-finke-deadline-hollywood-10th-anniversary-1201750730/\" target=\"_blank\">http://deadline.com/2016/05/nikki-finke-deadline-hollywood-10th-anniversary-1201750730/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120318103815/http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/pressed/2009/09/04/fixedja-nikki-finke/\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.archive.org/web/20120318103815/http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/pressed/2009/09/04/fixedja-nikki-finke/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/24/business/fi-ct-deadline24\" target=\"_blank\">http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/24/business/fi-ct-deadline24</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://deadline.com/2018/07/colony-canceled-usa-network-after-3-seasons-1202431078/\" target=\"_blank\">https://deadline.com/2018/07/colony-canceled-usa-network-after-3-seasons-1202431078/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://deadline.com/2018/07/riverdale-penelope-ann-miller-season-3-cast-cw-series-comic-con-1202431403/\" target=\"_blank\">https://deadline.com/2018/07/riverdale-penelope-ann-miller-season-3-cast-cw-series-comic-con-1202431403/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2017/02/01/nikki-finke-back-in-business-with-jay-penske/\" target=\"_blank\">https://pagesix.com/2017/02/01/nikki-finke-back-in-business-with-jay-penske/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/15/entertainment/et-onthemedia15\" target=\"_blank\">http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/15/entertainment/et-onthemedia15</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/business/media/after-year-of-feuding-nikki-finke-leaves-hollywood-website.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/business/media/after-year-of-feuding-nikki-finke-leaves-hollywood-website.html?_r=0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://deadline.com/2016/05/nikki-finke-deadline-hollywood-10th-anniversary-1201750730/\" target=\"_blank\">https://deadline.com/2016/05/nikki-finke-deadline-hollywood-10th-anniversary-1201750730/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"deadline.com","author":"Tony Silber","date":"2018-07-31T14:45:35.153+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/deadline.com/"}}
