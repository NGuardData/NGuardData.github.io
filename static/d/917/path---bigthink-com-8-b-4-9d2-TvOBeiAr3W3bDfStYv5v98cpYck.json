Hopkins told NewsGuard in an email that the company has raised $8 million between 2007 and 2016. The company’s current investors, listed on the site’s Advisors page, include Thomas Glocer, the former CEO of Thomson Reuter, and Lawrence Summers, the former director of the National Economics Council during the Obama administration. Frankel is also a current investor. </p>\n<p>Hopkins told NewsGuard the site’s revenue comes from advertising and sponsored content, and subscriptions to the site’s e-learning platform for businesses, Big Think Edge.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Big Think’s tagline is “Your Daily Microdose of Genius.” Its founders originally conceived of it as “YouTube for Ideas.” Videos are meant to offer insight into the minds of intellectuals and innovators, as well as figures like celebrities and politicians. Big Think began to publish written content, including blogs and editorial articles, in 2009. It now features articles from contributing writers, such as “Supercomputer Aurora 21 will map the human brain, starting in 2021,” and “How getting married changes your personality.” Big Think also produces a popular podcast, Think Again, which features interviews with a range of intellectual and cultural figures.</p>\n<p>The site’s original written and video content is divided into sections including Surprising Science, Personal Growth, Mind &#x26; Brain, Sex &#x26; Relationships, Technology &#x26; Innovation, Culture &#x26; Religion, and Politics &#x26; Current Affairs. A full list of people interviewed in Big Think’s videos, including astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and actor Nick Offerman, is available in the Experts section.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Headlines on the site are objective and fact-based. Big Think stories include sources for all images and attribute information to credible sources like journal articles and reputable news organizations. Sources are hyperlinked within articles.</p>\n<p>The site does not list a corrections policy, but issues corrections to stories in editor’s notes. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Some sponsored articles are clearly labeled, such as a June 2018 video in which Eugene Gholz, a professor from the University of Notre Dame, discusses relations between the US and North and South Korea. The video’s caption reads in part: “Eugene is brought to you today by The Charles Koch Foundation. The Charles Koch Foundation aims to further understanding of how US foreign policy affects American people and societal well-being.” However, other stories sponsored by the same organization are not labeled. A link for an August 2018 story about the commercial development of outer space specified that it was also sponsored by the Charles Koch Foundation. However, users could only see a “Sponsored by” byline, with no name listed.</p>\n<p>This inconsistent marking of sponsored content has led to NewsGuard to conclude that the site does not clearly label advertising. Hopkins told NewsGuard in September 2018 that the site had recently switched to a new platform and its editors were “currently working to reformat content from the prior platform.” He added: “Our sponsorships, which have a new design template as well, are also being retrofitted and updated. It is our editorial policy to clearly identify sponsors through attribution and branding.”</p>\n<p>The site’s Contact Us page includes a general email address, as well as one for editorial inquiries. The site does not provide a masthead or identify its top editors. Readers can contact a general email address for editors. Hopkins said that, due to recent changes to the site’s formatting, “pages such as the staff list are still being reformatted and will be live soon.”</p>\n<p>Writers’ bylines typically include biographical information. Bylines for content featuring or written by designated “experts” link to profiles with biographical details and sometimes social media contacts.</p>\n<p>The site’s copyright statement discloses its
