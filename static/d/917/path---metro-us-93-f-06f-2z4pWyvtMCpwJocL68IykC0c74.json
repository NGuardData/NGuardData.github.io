The site does not provide any information about the company. It is registered as a foreign business corporation in the state of New York. The company has also used the name Seabay New York when conducting its activities in New York, according to business filings with the New York Department of State. </p>\n<p>Metro US generates revenue through newspaper and online advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Metro US covers news of the day and entertainment stories in local versions covering New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston. The site’s About page said Metro is “written and designed for young and ambitious professionals” and posts short articles for readers on their morning commutes, “designed for a 20-minute read.”</p>\n<p>The site’s homepage publishes national and New York City stories at the top of the page -- with the tagline “Need to Know” -- while there are dedicated tabs for news from Boston, Philadelphia, and New York at the bottom. Metro.us also runs national and international stories from Reuters and Metro World News, Metro International’s own wire service. </p>\n<p>Local stories capture trends and changes in each city through daily features, including profiles of new businesses and local personalities, or issues that affect national politics and cities, such as a September 2018 story on the anniversary of the Occupy Wall Street movement. </p>\n<p>Celebrities have occasionally served as guest editors, such as actor Mark Ruffalo, who covered environmental topics on Earth Day; and pop singer Lady Gaga, who  selected and edited stories about equality. Former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell was the guest editor of a special edition of Metro Philadelphia ahead of the Democratic National Convention in the city.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Metro newsroom produces timely, and originally reported stories. that reference multiple points of view. Its original reporting provides diverse perspectives on local topics through interviews of residents, local politicians, or grassroot organizations. Headlines are accurate and straightforward and reflect content.<br></p>\n<p>The website does not have a system in place enabling readers to submit corrections or a page that explains how it handles errors and clarifications. NewsGuard could not locate examples of recently corrected stories on the site. Morgan Rousseau, the managing editor of Metro US, declined to comment on the company’s corrections policy.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site does not list its editorial staff or those in charge of the website. Articles include the names of the authors and sometimes link to their email and social media contacts.</p>\n<p>Metro.us does not clearly disclose that the newspaper is owned by a company called SB New York. The About Us page says that the newspaper is “published in more than 100 major cities across Europe, North &#x26; South America and Asia.” The Luxembourg-based Metro International company, which publishes free newspapers in 23 countries, is not the actual owner of Metro.us. The Swedish investment firm Kinnevik controls Metro International. Torun Litzén, Kinnevik’s director of corporate communication, confirmed to NewsGuard that Metro.us is independent from the Metro International operation. </p>\n<p>“Metro International, from an ownership and operations point of view, only includes Metro operations in Latin American and franchises in Russia,” Litzén said. “However, all Metro operations, share a common heritage and free newspaper business model. We were formerly part of one company.” Litzén added that links to all active Metro publications appear on the Metro International site.</p>\n<p>Morgan Rousseau refused to comment on Metro's ownership and lack of information about senior staff. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Metro launched in 1995 in Stockholm. The first U.S. newspaper was released in Philadelphia in 2000. The New York edition was first published in 2004.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSophia Tewa\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;John Gregory&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://media.metro.us\" target=\"_blank\">https://media.metro.us</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://media.metro.us/state-digital-metro-us/\" target=\"_blank\">https://media.metro.us/state-digital-metro-us/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/media/story/2015/08/metro-us-editor-aleksander-korab-is-out-004027\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politico.com/media/story/2015/08/metro-us-editor-aleksander-korab-is-out-004027</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.metro.lu/lang/en/about/management/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.metro.lu/lang/en/about/management/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.metro.lu/lang/en/investor-relations/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.metro.lu/lang/en/investor-relations/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.kinnevik.com/globalassets/documents/2.-investors/reports/2017/kinnevik-annual-report_2017.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.kinnevik.com/globalassets/documents/2.-investors/reports/2017/kinnevik-annual-report_2017.pdf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/0003947D:US-sb-new-york-inc\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/0003947D:US-sb-new-york-inc</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dos.ny.gov/corps/bus_entity_search.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.dos.ny.gov/corps/bus<em>entity</em>search.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.metro.us/news/the-big-stories/metro-ceo-yggers-mortensen-village-care-award\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.metro.us/news/the-big-stories/metro-ceo-yggers-mortensen-village-care-award</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/digital/metro-sells-u-s-papers-to-ex-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.adweek.com/digital/metro-sells-u-s-papers-to-ex-ceo/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.metro.lu/lang/en/metro-world-news/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.metro.lu/lang/en/metro-world-news/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/news/do-free-newspapers-make-more-money-online\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.poynter.org/news/do-free-newspapers-make-more-money-online</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/mark-ruffalo-newspaper-editor-kids-all-right-fracking-26736/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thewrap.com/mark-ruffalo-newspaper-editor-kids-all-right-fracking-26736/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110407005861/en/Metro-announces-Lady-Gaga-Global-Guest-Editor-in-Chief\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110407005861/en/Metro-announces-Lady-Gaga-Global-Guest-Editor-in-Chief</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.metro.us/ed-rendell-guest-editor/\" target=\"_blank\">https://media.metro.us/ed-rendell-guest-editor/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.metro.us/contact-us/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.metro.us/contact-us/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.metro.us/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.metro.us/about-us/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://media.metro.us/free-daily-newspapers-nyc/\" target=\"_blank\">https://media.metro.us/free-daily-newspapers-nyc/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.metro.lu/lang/en/about/our-story/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.metro.lu/lang/en/about/our-story/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.metro.us/local/ceo-and-publisher-yggers-mortensen-on-ten-years-of-metro/tmWned---50Eelh2WW1Ucs\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.metro.us/local/ceo-and-publisher-yggers-mortensen-on-ten-years-of-metro/tmWned---50Eelh2WW1Ucs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/399794381/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/399794381/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"metro.us","author":"Sophia Tewa","date":"2018-09-20T14:45:05.268+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/metro.us/"}}
