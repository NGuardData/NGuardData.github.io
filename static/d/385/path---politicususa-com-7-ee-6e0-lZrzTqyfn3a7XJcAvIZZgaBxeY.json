He is also the administrator for a Facebook group called, “I Watch Rachel Maddow and MSNBC.” Ad revenue is the site’s only funding source, Easley told NewsGuard.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Most stories focus on U.S. politics and are critical of President Donald Trump and his administration. Typical headlines: “Democratic Candidate Has Perfect Response to Shut Down Fox News” and “Eric Trump Whines That His Daddy’s Life Got Worse After He Ran For President.” </p>\n<p>Contributors primarily cite other news accounts, Twitter posts, and video clips in their reporting, often adding commentary highly critical of Trump and his policies.  Video is embedded in stories from cable television networks such as MSNBC, CNN, and C-SPAN.</p>\n<p>Headlines and topic sentences are often highly opinionated (from May 2018: “Rachel Maddow Brilliantly Uses Watergate Tapes To Show How Trump Is Guilty Of Obstruction.”)</p>\n<p>The site’s lead news section relies heavily on the Reuters news service for breaking stories. The site periodically publishes commentary, which appears in its Editorials section. A separate blog section called Liberal Nation Rising posts commentary by outside contributors on topics including gun control, foreign affairs, and liberal political philosophy.</p>\n<p>The site includes a sports category that is infrequently updated; it is written by contributors including high school and college students, with occasional Reuters wire stories and photos.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The site displays a link to its code of ethics (from the Society of Professional Journalists) on every page. However, some headlines are misleading and articles in the main Posts section often do not distinguish news from opinion. </p>\n<p>For example, an article headlined “The White House Doesn’t Deny that Trump Bribed Anthony Kennedy to Retire” drew its provocative conclusion based on a linked CNN video and transcript, which did not report that the White House was asked about “bribes.” (When contacted by NewsGuard, PoliticusUSA.com changed the headline to “The White House Doesn’t Deny Possible Deal for Anthony Kennedy to Retire” and noted the change in an update at the end of the story.)</p>\n<p>Another headline stated, “Trump Treason Confirmed as Putin Is Advising him on Security Issues.” The notion that Trump has committed “treason” is not backed up by any reporting in the article, and instead is simply asserted. This article did not appear in the Editorials section. Asked for comment, owner/editor Jason Easley told NewsGuard that his site plans to label posts as “News,” “Opinion” or “Analysis” in a forthcoming upgrade to the website.</p>\n<p>Editors post corrections at the top or bottom of stories. For example, on June 5, 2018, a story about Republican senators’ comments on the Robert Mueller investigation into Russian election interference included this note about a headline error: “The Senators said Trump could be, not is, guilty of obstruction of justice. This has been corrected.”</p>\n<p>Owner/editor Easley says the site was granted White House press credentials by the Obama administration in 2013, and were maintained by the Trump administration. The site does not have a bureau in Washington, but participates in a traveling press pool.  Its reporters were credentialed for both the Republican and Democratic conventions in 2016.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site states its mission is to be “a liberal and independent news site which would offer a mix of politics and opinion in an unfiltered environment, not beholden to any specific political or media agenda.”</p>\n<p>The site’s About Us page provides biographies of the editorial team and information on its access and credentials. Contributing bloggers have bylines but no further identification.</p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site was founded by Easley in 2008.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nStu Rohrer\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politicususa/\">https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politicususa/</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politicususa/\" target=\"_blank\">https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politicususa/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fake_news_websites\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List<em>of</em>fake<em>news</em>websites</a></h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fake_news_websites\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List<em>of</em>fake<em>news</em>websites</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.allsides.com/news-source/politicususa\">https://www.allsides.com/news-source/politicususa</a></h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.allsides.com/news-source/politicususa\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.allsides.com/news-source/politicususa</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.cafepress.com/politicususa/9497246\">https://www.cafepress.com/politicususa/9497246</a></h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cafepress.com/politicususa/9497246\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cafepress.com/politicususa/9497246</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cafepress.com/politicususa/9497246(online\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cafepress.com/politicususa/9497246(online</a> store, coffee mugs)</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Comments from the founder by email, see below</h3>\n</li>\n<li>Comments from the founder by email, see below</li>\n<li>Sample correction: <a href=\"https://www.politicususa.com/2018/06/05/gop-senators-say-trump-can-be-guilty-of-obstruction-of-justice.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politicususa.com/2018/06/05/gop-senators-say-trump-can-be-guilty-of-obstruction-of-justice.html</a></li>\n<li>Sample correction: <a href=\"https://www.politicususa.com/2017/10/02/illegitimate-president-math-trump-won-78000-votes-4-4-million-russian-facebook-ads.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politicususa.com/2017/10/02/illegitimate-president-math-trump-won-78000-votes-4-4-million-russian-facebook-ads.html</a></li>\n<li>See email responses from site owner/editor Jason Easley inserted in Notes</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"politicususa.com","author":"Stu Rohrer","date":"2018-11-12T20:26:29.865+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/politicususa.com/"}}
