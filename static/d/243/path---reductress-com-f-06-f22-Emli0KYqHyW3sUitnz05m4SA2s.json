Feminized.”</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>Founded in 2013 by comedy writers Beth Newell and Sarah Pappalardo, Reductress describes itself as the “first and only satirical women’s magazine.”</p>\n<p>Reductress parodies the way contemporary media aimed at women speaks of feminism, publishing satirical takes that emphasize women’s appearance and sexual appeal. On its About page, Reductress states that its mission “is to take on the outdated perspectives and condescending tone of popular women’s media, through the eyes of the funniest women in comedy today. Also, we want people to think we’re pretty.”</p>\n<p>The site does this by publishing ironic content in categories that mimic those of traditional women’s interest publications, such as “News,” “Living,” “Entertainment,” “Love and Sex,” “Thoughts,” and “Style.” These categories are mixed in with the “Womanspiration” section, which mocks inspiring stories with articles such as “Inspiring! Kaylee’s Garden Produced One Amazing Salad” and “Wow! This White Woman Went to a Protest Without Posting a Selfie.”</p>\n<p>The site also has a section labeled “Print Edition,” although Reductress does not publish a print edition. “No. Are you insane? Who would read that?! The Print Edition is where we house one-liner jokes,” reads a response to a question on the site about whether it publishes in print.</p>\n<p>Reductress also produces two weekly satirical podcast, covering news and lifestyle.</p>\n<p>The site is privately and independently owned, and generates revenue through advertisements, reader donations, and an online shop that sells clothing with slogans such as “Tired Feminist” and “Future Matriarchal Overlord.”</p>\n<p>The site also earns revenue from sales of a book “How to Win at Feminism: The Definitive Guide to Having it All--and Then Some!” which — marketed as a tool to become “a feminist through mass consumerism and a carefully curated personal brand” —  captures the site’s ethos. “After all, we’re not wearing girdles and cleaning the house anymore. We’re wearing Spanx and hiring a cleaning lady. That’s feminism!” the book’s description reads.</p>\n<p>Reductress also hosts live comedy events and free workshops on writing satire.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nYemile Bucay\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/how-reductress-learned-stop-meditating-and-start-screaming-online-540762\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newsweek.com/how-reductress-learned-stop-meditating-and-start-screaming-online-540762</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://reductress.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">http://reductress.com/about/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/how-reductress-learned-stop-meditating-and-start-screaming-online-540762\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newsweek.com/how-reductress-learned-stop-meditating-and-start-screaming-online-540762</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://realorsatire.com/reductress-com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://realorsatire.com/reductress-com/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://reductress.com/post/straight-couple-has-audacity-to-fuck-during-pride-month/\" target=\"_blank\">http://reductress.com/post/straight-couple-has-audacity-to-fuck-during-pride-month/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://reductress.com/post/i-dont-want-children-because-i-am-perfectly-fulfilled-raising-my-boyfriend/\" target=\"_blank\">http://reductress.com/post/i-dont-want-children-because-i-am-perfectly-fulfilled-raising-my-boyfriend/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jezebel.com/reductress-is-devoting-its-entire-site-to-rape-jokes-th-1785404690\" target=\"_blank\">https://jezebel.com/reductress-is-devoting-its-entire-site-to-rape-jokes-th-1785404690</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://reductress.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">http://reductress.com/about/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://reductress.com/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">http://reductress.com/contact/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/how-reductress-learned-stop-meditating-and-start-screaming-online-540762\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newsweek.com/how-reductress-learned-stop-meditating-and-start-screaming-online-540762</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160820181843/http://www.wired.com/2016/08/reductress-pitch-perfect/\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.archive.org/web/20160820181843/http://www.wired.com/2016/08/reductress-pitch-perfect/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"reductress.com","author":"Yemile Bucay","date":"2018-09-12T19:05:57.508+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/reductress.com/"}}
