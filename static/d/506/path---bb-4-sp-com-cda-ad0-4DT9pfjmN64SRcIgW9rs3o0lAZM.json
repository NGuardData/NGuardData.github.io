The website earns revenue from advertising, sponsored content, and reader-donations. Luke lives in Midwest City, Oklahoma.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Barracuda Brigade’s mission is “to promote and protect individual rights and freedoms as set forth in the United States Constitution.” The site organizes its content into four sections: Palin, Trump, Obama, and Clinton. Stories provides short commentary on soundbites, news, tweets, and other conservative media coverage of each politician. </p>\n<p>Barracuda Brigade’s Facebook page underscores how the site is a place “to show support and appreciation for Sarah Palin,” the former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential candidate (by all appearances, bb4sp stands for Barracuda Brigade For Sarah Palin). Many stories focus on Palin quotes and beliefs. Other coverage includes stories about Palin’s work with President Trump and the late Sen. John McCain, as well as news about the 2017 defamation lawsuit, since dismissed, which Palin brought against The New York Times.</p>\n<p>Barracuda Brigade provides positive coverage of Trump with such stories as “President Trump Takes On Google: ‘Very serious situation-will be addressed’” and “President Trump Delivers World-Class Smackdown to CNN’s Jim Acosta.” The site also publishes stories that are critical of Clinton and Obama, regularly providing a platform for conspiracy theories, sensationalized stories, or distorted information.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Barracuda Brigade has provided a platform for the “Spygate” conspiracy, an unsubstantiated theory contending that the Obama administration planted a spy within Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Although there is no supporting evidence for the theory, Barracuda Brigade has repeatedly published stories that promote it, distorting or misrepresenting facts. For example, an August 2018 story stated that Trump’s attorney, Rudy Giuliani, “outed former Obama CIA Director John Brennan as the man in charge of ‘Spygate.’” In fact, Giuliani  admitted in May 2018 that “Spygate” -- and his repeated reference of it -- has been a publicity tactic to influence public opinion. </p>\n<p>Another story distorted a tweet by Eric Holder, the former U.S Attorney General, to include mention of “Spygate.” The headline stated that “Holder Warns Lines Have Been Drawn: Demands GOP Lawmakers Halt Investigations Into FISA Abuse &#x26; Spygate.” Holder’s tweet, included in the story, makes no mention or allusion to the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>Barracuda Brigade has published stories promoting the “deep state” theory, which maintains that a select group of elites controls the government, regardless of administration. An undated story stated that “fired FBI Director James Comey lashed out at President Trump after the White House announced the President was considering revoking security clearances of Obama’s Deep State operatives.” In the video referenced in the story, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump was considering revoking security clearances for some ex-intelligence chiefs, but she did not call them “deep state operatives.”</p>\n<p>Barracuda Brigade rarely references stories from established publishers of conservative news. The site regularly aggregates from sources that often do not publish firsthand information or have published misinformation, including The Gateway Pundit, The Geller Report, and Allen West Republic. Barracuda Brigade also cherry-picks and exaggerates statistics, publishing stories based on polls from a conservative polling company, Rasmussen Reports. One undated story stated that Trump had a 50-percent approval rating, “which probably means it’s closer to 60%.” The site provided no additional evidence for this claim.</p>\n<p>Because it has provided a platform for conspiracy theories and distorted information in stories (and headlines), NewsGuard has determined that Barracuda Brigade has repeatedly published false content and sensationalized headlines. Because Barracuda Brigade regularly sources information from sites that have published misinformation, NewsGuard has also determined that the site does not gather information responsibly.  </p>\n<p>The site states that it “seeks to publish corrections and clarifications promptly,” but NewsGuard was not able to find examples of corrected stories.</p>\n<p>Barracuda Brigade did not reply to NewsGuard’s two emails and one phone call placed seeking comment about how the site handles corrections, why it publishes conspiracy theories, and why it often sources information from sites that regularly publish misinformation</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Barracuda Brigade clearly names and provides information about its owner (who is also the author of all the content). The site clearly discloses its conservative mission. Advertising on the site is clearly labeled.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Barracuda Brigade started in December 2009 as a Facebook fan page for former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. The website was created in March 2015.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership
