{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<div class=\"right-score\">Score: 0</div>\n<h1>thehardtimes.net&emsp; <span class=\"net-country\">(WEB - en-US)</span></h1>\n<p>A satirical news site focused on the punk music scene that also pokes fun at politics and politicians.  </p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>The Hard Times was founded in 2014 by its editor-in-chief, Matt Saincome, who was an editor at SF Weekly, along with his brother Ed Saincome and comedian Bill Conway. The three originally founded the site to post inside jokes about the music scene. “Punk News Comin' Your Way!” boasts its tagline. In a 2017 Billboard article, Matt Saincome said he started the site as the music-lover’s answer to The Onion.</p>\n<p>Saincome owns The Hard Times, which he confirmed in an email to NewsGuard. It is financed by advertisements, merchandise sales, and revenue from a concert series. In February 2017, the site partnered with Consequence Media, a music marketing company, to create marketing and video content. </p>\n<p>“My whole life was about music and I was young and I was going to DIY basement shows and so [The Onion’s] Area Man wasn't me,” Saincome told Billboard, referring to the Onion’s standing gag that reports on a fictional “area man.” “So I thought, there's got to be a hole in the media landscape and I could create a publication that could serve the satirical interest of not just people who like punk music, but people who are underground subculture music types, people who are more likely to understand what it's like to be on tour than it is to take your kid to preschool.”</p>\n<p>Two of the site’s main sections are Music, divided into subsections for different music genres, and Culture, containing subsections including Weed and Straight Edge/Vegan. Music-related articles have included “Subscription Service Sends New Drummer to Your Doorstep Every Month” and “Terror Fan Buys Dental Insurance In Anticipation of Album Release Show.” Other stories poke fun at recognizable phenomena, such as “Google Maps ‘Dad Mode’ Consists Entirely of Shortcuts” and “Black Metal Coffee Shop Introduces Rotting Pumpkin Latte.” </p>\n<p>Although the site’s has stayed true to punk roots, The Hard Times also satirizes U.S. news and politics. In early October 2018, for example, the site posted an article titled “Tiffany Trump Receives First Ever Text From Father,” quipping that the first message the President’s Trump’s daughter Tiffany received from her father was a Federal Emergency Management Agency’s test alert message, which was sent to millions of cell phones nationwide. Another article asked, “How Dare You Boycott Nike When They Employ so Many Children of Color?”</p>\n<p>The site dedicates a section to satirical Video Games news, called Hard Drive. (The Hard Drive brand also hosts a page on Twitch, a platform for live streaming video of video games.) An Opinions section contains satirical commentaries, such as “Opinion: While You’re Distracted by Bert and Ernie’s Sexuality, Muppets in Flint Michigan Still Don’t Have Clean Drinking Water” and “Alt-Right Review: I Rewatched Seinfeld and I Think This Guy Might Be A Jew.” The site publishes weekly satirical horoscopes, called “Hardcoroscopes.”</p>\n<p>On its About page, the site sarcastically describes itself as “very real punk news site that you should not question,” but then acknowledges that it is satirical. The page names its staff of approximately 20 full-time editors and managers and provides links to social media profiles or personal websites for most of them. The Contact Us page provides the email address of its editor-in-chief. Most stories name their authors, although some are attributed only to The Hard Times Staff.</p>\n<p>“I always wanted Hard Times to be something of a refuge,” site co-founder Matt Saincome said in a 2017 interview with the Los Angeles Times. “If you don't want to listen to the news, then you can read a joke about how to kill the guitar player in your band.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSarah Brandt\n\nEdited by:\nKendrick McDonald&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-hard-times-20170110-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-hard-times-20170110-story.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thehardtimes.net/about/\" target=\"_blank\">https://thehardtimes.net/about/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thehardtimes.net/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">https://thehardtimes.net/contact/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thehardtimes.net/live-events/\" target=\"_blank\">https://thehardtimes.net/live-events/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/harddrivenews\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.twitch.tv/harddrivenews</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thehardtimes.net/harddrive/\" target=\"_blank\">https://thehardtimes.net/harddrive/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thehardtimes.net/music/\" target=\"_blank\">https://thehardtimes.net/music/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thehardtimes.net/culture/\" target=\"_blank\">https://thehardtimes.net/culture/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://shop.thehardtimes.net/\" target=\"_blank\">https://shop.thehardtimes.net/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thehardtimes.net/opinion/opinion-while-youre-distracted-by-bert-and-ernies-sexuality-muppets-in-flint-michigan-still-dont-have-clean-drinking-water/\" target=\"_blank\">https://thehardtimes.net/opinion/opinion-while-youre-distracted-by-bert-and-ernies-sexuality-muppets-in-flint-michigan-still-dont-have-clean-drinking-water/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thehardtimes.net/opinion/\" target=\"_blank\">https://thehardtimes.net/opinion/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thehardtimes.net/hardstyle/alt-right-review-rewatched-seinfeld-think-guy-might-jew/\" target=\"_blank\">https://thehardtimes.net/hardstyle/alt-right-review-rewatched-seinfeld-think-guy-might-jew/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thehardtimes.net/culture/tiffany-trump-receives-first-ever-text-from-father/\" target=\"_blank\">https://thehardtimes.net/culture/tiffany-trump-receives-first-ever-text-from-father/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thehardtimes.net/culture/black-metal-coffee-shop-introduces-rotting-pumpkin-latte/\" target=\"_blank\">https://thehardtimes.net/culture/black-metal-coffee-shop-introduces-rotting-pumpkin-latte/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thehardtimes.net/culture/google-maps-dad-mode-consists-entirely-of-shortcuts/\" target=\"_blank\">https://thehardtimes.net/culture/google-maps-dad-mode-consists-entirely-of-shortcuts/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thehardtimes.net/music/fan-still-refers-to-bands-19-year-old-album-as-their-new-one/\" target=\"_blank\">https://thehardtimes.net/music/fan-still-refers-to-bands-19-year-old-album-as-their-new-one/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thehardtimes.net/culture/your-weekly-hardcoroscopes-22/\" target=\"_blank\">https://thehardtimes.net/culture/your-weekly-hardcoroscopes-22/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8214723/the-hard-times-matt-saincome-spotlight-interview\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8214723/the-hard-times-matt-saincome-spotlight-interview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://consequencemedia.com/#publishers\" target=\"_blank\">https://consequencemedia.com/#publishers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/consequence-media/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/consequence-media/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-fastest-growing-satirical-publication-joins-consequence-media-300406783.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-fastest-growing-satirical-publication-joins-consequence-media-300406783.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/Document/RetrievePDF?Id=201602310374-20553819\" target=\"_blank\">https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/Document/RetrievePDF?Id=201602310374-20553819</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"thehardtimes.net","author":"Sarah Brandt","date":"2018-10-05T20:09:04.202+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/thehardtimes.net/"}}
