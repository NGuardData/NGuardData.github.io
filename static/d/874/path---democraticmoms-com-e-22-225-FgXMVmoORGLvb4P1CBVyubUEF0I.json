The site’s name was anonymously registered in 2016. The site’s Facebook page states the people managing the page work out of Israel, Nigeria, and the Philippines. Democratic Moms’ Privacy Policy page states that Democratic Moms Ltd. operates the website. However, its About Us page also mentions an apparent parent company named “TheViralDance.” Theviraldance.com does not appear to operate anymore but records indicate it was set up by an Israeli company named Vivas Media Ltd, which has anonymously registered several viral news websites aimed at women, including stylechambers.com, weightlossgrove.com, and misspennystocks.com. These sites’ About sections look identical to the About section on Democraticmoms.com, which begins,  “TheViralDance is the place to get updated on everything that’s internet.” </p>\n<p>The Democratic Moms website features a link to a “Shop” section in its navigation bar but it appears to be defunct. The site runs advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site publishes sharply opinionated commentary from a liberal, anti-Trump perspective. Articles rely on social media posts and online interviews given by both Republican and Democratic politicians. The site has a section called Moms, with features about women and politics, or celebrities making comments on political news, as well as about government policies affecting women, childbirth, pregnancy, and families. A section called NeverTrump focuses on the Trump administration, but resembles the breaking news section. A section called Women Leadership has not been updated since December 2016, when the last articles published were about Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the presidential election.</p>\n<p>Democraticmoms.com’s Facebook page states its purpose: “We are mom and families working daily to maintain our children’s future” in the country. “Join us today!” There is no disclosure of ideology on the site, other than its name.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Democraticmoms.com articles regularly plagiarize content from other news outlets, crediting the stories to site writers. A BBC story on the death in August 2018 of singer Aretha Franklin appeared nearly verbatim on the site, and another story titled “Kylie Jenner, self-made billionaire” republishes a story produced by Vox.com without attribution. The site also has used content from sites such as washingtonpress.com, a hyperpartisan site that NewsGuard has determined publishes dubious content.</p>\n<p>Democratic Moms did not respond to two NewsGuard Facebook messages asking whether the site has permission to copy content from other websites and whether it has any fact checking procedures for the information that it republishes.</p>\n<p>Some stories that Democraticmoms.com published from other sources were false. In 2017,  the site published a story from politicalo.com, which calls itself a “hybrid News/Satire platform,” reporting that Trump’s son, Eric Trump, said, “My father’s tax return is irrelevant because we’re going to cancel taxes for WEALTHY people anyway.” The article, first reported on by PolitiFact, has since been deleted from the site. An April 2017 article titled “Tiffany Trump Insults CHRISTIANS with Picture of Jesus and Trump in an EMBRACE” reported that a painting of Jesus hugging Trump was shared by a social media account run by Trump’s daughter, Tiffany. News sites including Buzzfeed and the Independent published articles showing that the post came from a fake account. The site has not removed the story or published a correction to this article.</p>\n<p>Articles in stories labeled as news regularly insert highly negative language about Trump, referring to him as as a “rotting, bloated head” (August 2018), “Cowardly Donald Trump” (July 2018), and to his administration as “a symbol of the worst excesses and the most heinous sins of America’s worst impulses” (September 2018).</p>\n<p>Because of its publication of plagiarized stories, including false stories, NewsGuard has determined that Democraticmoms.com does not gather and present information responsibly. Because of its insertion of strong partisan opinion into most of its news stories, NewsGuard has determined the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. </p>\n<p>Democraticmoms.com does not appear to have ever published a correction and does not feature a stated corrections policy.</p>\n<p>Democratic Moms did not respond to two NewsGuard Facebook messages asking whether the site runs corrections and other questions about its editorial policies, including its use of strong opinion in news stories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Democraticmoms.com offers no information about its editorial or contributing staff. It does not disclose its ownership. Articles are generally published under the name “Ernest E.” Earlier articles were published under the name “Maya.M.” Advertising is clearly distinguished from news content.</p>\n<p>The only contact information in the site is an email inviting users to ask questions about the site’s privacy policy. An email inquiry sent to the address was not deliverable. Democratic Moms did not respond to two NewsGuard messages to its Facebook page asking whether the website discloses its ownership or the identities of its staff and editors.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The website’s domain was registered in late November 2016. The first article on the site was published in December 2016. An almost identical site, “ProuDemocrat”, appears to have been set up in early 2016 by the same people who operate Democratic Moms.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBron Maher\n\nEdited
