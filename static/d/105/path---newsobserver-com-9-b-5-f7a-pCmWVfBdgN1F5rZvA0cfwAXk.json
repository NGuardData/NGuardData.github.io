It also operates McClatchy DC, a news agency based in Washington that provides political coverage to McClatchy’s newspapers. McClatchy generates the bulk of its revenue from subscriptions to its printed and digital products, and from advertising.</p>\n<p>The site runs advertisements and sponsored content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site covers the Raleigh metropolitan area and  greater North Carolina, as well as national news and politics. Local stories are written by The News &#x26; Observer reporters, while regional and national coverage is supplied by other McClatchy bureaus or The Associated Press.</p>\n<p>The site’s coverage centers on crime, education<em>, </em>business, city and state politics, and local entertainment. It runs several columnists who concentrate on regional issues. The website also partners with Politifact to publish PolitiFact North Carolina, a fact-checking project focused on the state’s lawmakers.</p>\n<p>In its opinion pages, clearly labeled as such, the News &#x26; Observer has taken liberal editorial positions on social policies and on politics. It has criticized Republican efforts to weaken or abolish the Affordable Care Act, for example, took issue with President Donald Trump’s policy of separating immigrant children from their parents, and favored helping immigrants seeking asylum. The newspaper generally endorses Democratic presidential candidates, including Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016, Barack Obama over Mitt Romney in 2012, and Obama over John McCain in 2008.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Headlines are straightforward. Although many stories link to other News &#x26; Observer articles as sources, they often rely on original interviews and reporting. Articles generally link to credible third-party sources. The newspaper has won three Pulitzer Prizes, most recently in 1996 for its coverage of environmental and health risks caused by waste disposal in the region.</p>\n<p>The site regularly publishes corrections for its own articles, and for those from the AP.  Corrections generally appear in italics above articles.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The website has a portal for general comments. It also lists the names, titles, phone numbers and emails for every editorial employee, as well as for the company’s top business executives. Articles name the writer and generally provide an email address. The site allows for reader comments on individual articles. </p>\n<p>Visitors are also able to submit questions or comments through the Contact Us page. The site’s About Us page makes clear the publication’s relationship with The McClatchy Company. </p>\n<p>Advertisements are differentiated from editorial content. Sponsored content is labeled as “FROM OUR ADVERTISING PARTNERS.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The News &#x26; Observer dates to the 1865 founding of The Sentinel, which was later absorbed by The Observer and merged with The News in 1880 to become The News &#x26; Observer.</p>\n<p>The Sentinel took positions against post-Civil War Reconstruction, and Josephus Daniels, who bought The News &#x26; Observer in 1894, sought to use it to bolster the state Democratic Party. </p>\n<p>The News &#x26; Observer’s website was founded in 1994.</p>\n<p><em>Editor's Note: This Nutrition Label has been updated, and its rating has changed, after McClatchy changed the way it labeled paid content hosted by content recommendation firm ZergNet. The rating has changed to reflect that NewsObserver.com clearly labels advertising.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/customer-service/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newsobserver.com/customer-service/about-us/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/customer-service/contact-us/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newsobserver.com/customer-service/contact-us/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/article10350140.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/article10350140.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.themediumthemessage.com/2011/06/07/mcclatchy-consolidating-carolinas-copy-desk/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.themediumthemessage.com/2011/06/07/mcclatchy-consolidating-carolinas-copy-desk/</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/the-nando-cuts-70-jobs-consolidates-coverage-with-charlotte-observer/Content?oid=1209104\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/the-nando-cuts-70-jobs-consolidates-coverage-with-charlotte-observer/Content?oid=1209104</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article101543362.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article101543362.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/article196013019.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/article196013019.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-mcclatchy-company#section-overview\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-mcclatchy-company#section-overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/editorials/article215967180.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/editorials/article215967180.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/editorials/article216296195.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/editorials/article216296195.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper_endorsements_in_the_United_States_presidential_election,_2016\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper<em>endorsements</em>in<em>the</em>United<em>States</em>presidential<em>election,</em>2016</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper_endorsements_in_the_United_States_presidential_election,_2008\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper<em>endorsements</em>in<em>the</em>United<em>States</em>presidential<em>election,</em>2008</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/news-observer-raleigh-nc\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/news-observer-raleigh-nc</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/advertise/market-data/article10350698.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newsobserver.com/advertise/market-data/article10350698.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ncpedia.org/raleigh-news-and-observer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ncpedia.org/raleigh-news-and-observer</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article215190600.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article215190600.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article224047340.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article224047340.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zergnet.com/news/3663859/best-to-worst-dressed-on-the-golden-globes-red-carpet\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.zergnet.com/news/3663859/best-to-worst-dressed-on-the-golden-globes-red-carpet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nickiswift.com/142129/ranking-the-2019-golden-globes-best-to-worst-dressed-stars/?utm_source=zergnet.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=zergnet_3663859&utm_content=286\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nickiswift.com/142129/ranking-the-2019-golden-globes-best-to-worst-dressed-stars/?utm<em>source=zergnet.com&#x26;utm</em>medium=referral&#x26;utm<em>campaign=zergnet</em>3663859&#x26;utm_content=286</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"newsobserver.com","author":"Anna-Sophie Harling","date":"2019-02-22T17:23:46.680+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/newsobserver.com/"}}
