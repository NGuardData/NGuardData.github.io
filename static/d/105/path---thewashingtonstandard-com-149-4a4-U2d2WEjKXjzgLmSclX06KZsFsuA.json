Brown runs The Washington Standard’s Facebook page and the site links to his personal Twitter profile. He is also an editor and author at conservative news sites FreedomOutpost.com, SonsOfLibertyMedia.com, and GunsInTheNews.com. Content that appears on The Washington Standard also appears on these sites.</p>\n<p>The Washington Standard derives revenue through advertisements and sponsored links.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Washington Standard publishes news and commentary that generally supports a conservative perspective, although the site does not profess to have a point of view.</p>\n<p>Content appears in five sections — US News, Politics, Constitution &#x26; Law, World News, and Economy. A “Gun News” link directs readers to GunsInTheNews.com, and a “National Headlines Today” link directs readers to ReformedMedia.net, a curated collection of stories that are published mostly from conservative news sites.</p>\n<p>Many articles and headlines published by The Washington Standard are copied from other news sites. The Washington Standard credits these outlets at the bottom of the story.</p>\n<p>Typical articles on The Washington Standard have run under headlines including “Sorry AOC, Stunning New Poll Finds Public Support for Capitalism Is Growing In America;” “Angry Americans Demand DNC Pay Back Money Spent On Russia Collusion Investigation;” and “Yes, President Trump Has Constitutional Authority to Secure Our Southern Border.”</p>\n<p>Brown told NewsGuard in a phone interview that he started The Washington Standard because he believes that “people need to know the truth that oftentimes the mainstream media will not cover. They will not provide certain facts for certain things. They will not provide certain documentation for certain things, and it doesn’t matter if it’s the right or the left.”</p>\n<p>He added that articles on the site support his worldview, which he described as upholding the Christian Bible and the U.S. Constitution. “The issue is the law,” he said. “That’s what we support. Not a person. Not a party. We support the law.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Washington Standard has published numerous articles that promote false news unconfirmed reports, and conspiracy theories.</p>\n<p>As recently as August 2018, The Washington Standard promoted the theory that Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was killed because he shared DNC emails with WikiLeaks. “I’ll let the people be the judge of the facts, but all indicators point to the fact that Rich was the leaker and that he was murdered because of it,” the August 2018 article stated. Another story, published the month before, stated, “It is widely believed that Seth Rich was WikiLeaks’ source for the Podesta Email leaks.”</p>\n<p>In fact, law enforcement authorities said that Rich was killed during an unsolved robbery in 2016. In July 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers in relation to a hack of the DNC and subsequent leak of emails.</p>\n<p>Articles on The Washington Standard have also promoted the conspiracy theory, known as “Pizzagate,” that claims that Hillary Clinton and others operated a pedophilia ring from a Washington pizza restaurant. “Without taking down the DC pedophile rings, the swamp will never be drained, and they will continue to corrupt the direction of this nation,” the site wrote in April 2017. A January 2017 story stated, “While Pizzagate itself may not be a provable idea, to dismiss it like it is impossible is simply irresponsible — especially given the history of people in authority in this country.” In fact, the Pizzagate claims have been debunked and dismissed by law enforcement authorities and multiple media outlets.</p>\n<p>Asked about the site’s coverage of the Seth Rich and Pizzagate conspiracies, Brown told NewsGuard in a phone interview: “Sure, is there a question that should be asked over Seth Rich? Is there a question that should be asked over Pizzagate? Of course there are questions, that’s part of investigative journalism. Would you agree? Or do you think that journalists should just take what the state gives them and leave it at that?”</p>\n<p>Other articles on the site have advanced the notion that billionaire philanthropist and major Democratic donor George Soros was a Nazi collaborator. “What? Is there no one left who is not in Nazi collaborator George Soros’ pocket?” a December 2018 story asked. Another December 2018 article stated, “Nazi collaborator George Soros is a vicious antisemite … Lately, the hard-left enemedia outlets have been floating the ridiculous trope that to criticize Soros is antisemitic, because Soros is Jewish. But if Soros is Jewish, he is a Jewicidal kapo.”</p>\n<p>Soros, who was 14 years old when World War II ended in 1945, hid from the Nazis during his childhood in Hungary by pretending for a short time to be the godson of a Christian government official, according to multiple accounts.</p>\n<p>Brown, in his conversation with NewsGuard, cited a 1998 interview Soros gave to the CBS News show “60 Minutes” as evidence of Soros’ “collaboration” with the Nazis. In the interview, Soros confirmed that while accompanying the man posing as his godfather, he was present when other Jews had their property confiscated. “Whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator,” he said. “The property was being taken away. I had no role in taking away that property so I had no sense of guilt.” Soros’ father, Tivadar Soros, wrote in his 1965 autobiography that his son, a young teen at the time, had been present at one such property confiscation.</p>\n<p>Because The Washington Standard has regularly advanced debunked conspiracy theories and published unconfirmed reports, NewsGuard has determined that it repeatedly publishes false news and does not gather and present information responsibly.</p>\n<p>After an earlier version of this Nutrition Label was published, Brown questioned its accuracy and fairness, saying that NewsGuard had an agenda and that it was targeting sites it disagreed with. </p>\n<p>“This is not opinion, this is libel,” he said. “You’re putting this out to other people, you’re putting it out in the mainstream as though it is fact, when a lot of what you have written is just outright lies.”</p>\n<p>Much of the opinion content on The Washington Standard is labeled “commentary” and published in a dedicated section. However, the site regularly includes opinion in news stories. </p>\n<p>For example, a headline on a February 2019 news story described U.S. Attorney General William Barr as a “Gun-Confiscating, Swamp Creature.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, The Washington Standard does not disclose a political or ideological perspective, stating on its About Us page that “the purpose of The Washington Standard is to provide news, commentary and information from the US and around the world.” Yet the site cherry picks stories and facts to advance its agenda. </p>\n<p>For these reasons, NewsGuard’s has determined that the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>“I mean, look, I don’t even like considering myself a journalist,” Brown told NewsGuard, in response to a question about his site’s handling of opinion. “Some people have introduced me as unbiased journalism. No, all of us are biased. Every single person that writes anything is biased…. We have a bias as to our worldview, that’s the issue…. Which one is more attuned to the law than the other? … So when you say, well, you have a sort of conservative lean, well what does that mean? Does that mean I’m more towards the law or more away from it? … I can point out in almost every single thing that’s called progressive, it’s progressing away from the law and towards socialism and communism. And which ultimately is totalitarianism.”  </p>\n<p>“If I have an agenda, it is, I’d like to see people be real Christians,” he added. “I’m not talking about fake ones. I’m not talking about the hypocrites. I’m talking about real Christians, real loving the neighbor, loving God … and living in peace and harmony with one another. I would like to see that, I really would.”</p>\n<p>The Washington Standard does not state a corrections policy and NewsGuard could not find corrections on the site from after 2016.</p>\n<p>“I don’t have a specific policy, but if I see something wrong I don’t have any problem correcting that,” Brown told NewsGuard. Brown said that as far as he knows, he has not made corrections to any articles on The Washington Standard, which was launched in 2013, but he referenced corrections he made on another one of his sites.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles written by Brown and writer Corey Lynn name the author and link to archives of their work, along with short biographies. Stories that have been aggregated from other sites typically credit the original publisher.  Users can contact The Washington Standard through a general feedback form on the site’s Contact page.</p>\n<p>After a previous version of this Nutrition Label was published, Brown added information about his ownership on the site’s About Us page. That page now identifies Brown as the site’s founder and owner, and Brown states that he is the site’s editor in his biography, which can be accessed through his articles. </p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguished from editorial content. A disclosure at the bottom of each page states that posts on The Washington Standard may contain affiliate links and that the site earns “a small commission from those links.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Brown founded The Washington Standard in 2013. The earliest posts are from 2015.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label incorrectly stated how long the site has existed. It was founded in 2013.</em></p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This Nutrition Label has been updated to reflect that the site added information about its </em><em>ownership</em><em> and to include comments from the site’s owner, founder, and editor, Tim Brown.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nMelissa Goldin\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a
