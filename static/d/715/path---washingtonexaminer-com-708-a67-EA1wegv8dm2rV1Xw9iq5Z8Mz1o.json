MediaDC is controlled by billionaire Philip Anschutz, who built fortunes in the fossil fuel, railroad, telecom, and entertainment industries and has invested heavily in wind energy. Anschutz owns stakes in professional sports teams, the Staples Center in Los Angeles, the Coachella music festival, and vacation resorts.</p>\n<p>Anschutz donated over $600,000 to Republican candidates and committees in the 2016 election cycle. His foundation, the Anschutz Foundation, has given money to a variety of conservative political groups, including the pro-business American Legislative Exchange Council, the Koch brothers’ Americans for Prosperity, anti-marijuana legalization groups, and The Federalist Society, a conservative legal group that has shaped President Donald Trump’s nominations for the federal bench. </p>\n<p>Anschutz has also given to groups that critics have allege are anti-LGBTQ. In response, Anschutz has called those charges “fake news,” and donated $1 million to the Elton John AIDS Foundation, issuing a statement declaring: “I support the rights of all people and oppose discrimination and intolerance against the LGBTQ community.”</p>\n<p>The Washington Examiner sells ads on its website and in its weekly print magazine. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Washingtonexaminer.com publishes news stories with a focus on national politics. The publication employs correspondents dedicated to covering Congress, the White House, the Supreme Court, as well as defense, energy and the environment, criminal justice, foreign affairs, economics, and healthcare. It also has commentary writers and columnists. </p>\n<p>The site posts breaking news at the top of its homepage, with a variety of categories near the top of the page, including Politics, Policy, News, Opinion, Business, Beltway Confidential, and Washington Secrets. The Washington Examiner publishes opinion pieces with a conservative perspective, as well as some video content. An editorial board publishes editorials most days, and has been critical of President Trump. A July 30, 2018 editorial sided with Democratic attorneys general who brought a lawsuit against him over alleged business conflicts of interest. While contending the suit had “zero precedent,” it wrote that Trump’s “worldwide business empire creates conflicts of interest that the president of the U.S. shouldn’t have.”</p>\n<p>The site has a subscription service for a digital version of its weekly print magazine. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Washington Examiner reporters occasionally break stories, but many articles are the reporting by other outlets. They sometimes reach out to the subjects of stories for comment. Although it has a right-of-center viewpoint, the site’s reporters write straight news stories and the site generally distinguishes between news articles and opinion pieces. On its Contact Us page, the Washington Examiner has an option for suggesting corrections. An Examiner spokesperson and editor did not respond to four emails about the Examiner’s corrections policy. </p>\n<p>Advertisements are clearly differentiated from editorial content. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The Washington Examiner discloses that it is published by MediaDC and that MediaDC is owned by Clarity Media Group, a private company. However, it doesn’t disclose on its About Examiner page that Clarity Media Group, which doesn’t have a website, is the property of Anschutz. The Washington Examiner has disclosed Anschutz’s ownership in some stories that mention other Anschutz properties.</p>\n<p>Stories run with bylines that generally link to the reporter’s biography and email address. Washington Examiner also lists editors and staff, with bios and email addresses, on a Staff page.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Washington Examiner newspaper was launched as a tabloid in 2005. In 2013, the paper ended its local news coverage and transitioned from a six-day-a-week newspaper to a weekly news magazine. </p>\n<p>The site was registered in 2006, according to domain registration database ICANN WHOIS.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this Nutrition Label gave the incorrect year for the site’s registration. Washingtonexaminer.com was registered in 2006.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJosh Keefe\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Jim Warren&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2009/10/phil-anschutzs-conservative-agenda-028355?o=2\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politico.com/story/2009/10/phil-anschutzs-conservative-agenda-028355?o=2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/music/news/aeg-founder-philip-anschutz-anti-lgbt-marijuana-1202681386/\" target=\"_blank\">https://variety.com/2018/music/news/aeg-founder-philip-anschutz-anti-lgbt-marijuana-1202681386/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.claritymediagroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.claritymediagroup.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.coloradoindependent.com/160128/colorado-media-news-2\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.coloradoindependent.com/160128/colorado-media-news-2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/oklahoman_sea_island_anschutz.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cjr.org/united<em>states</em>project/oklahoman<em>sea</em>island_anschutz.php</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7647568/who-is-philip-anschutz-aeg-coachella\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7647568/who-is-philip-anschutz-aeg-coachella</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.weeklystandard.com/about-us\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.weeklystandard.com/about-us</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2012/11/30/anschutz-buys-colorado-springs-gazette.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2012/11/30/anschutz-buys-colorado-springs-gazette.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theomc.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">https://theomc.com/about/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/philip-anschutz/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.forbes.com/profile/philip-anschutz/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.anschutz-exploration.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.anschutz-exploration.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7647563/aeg-owner-phillip-anschutz-anti-lgbtq-reports-fake-news-statement\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7647563/aeg-owner-phillip-anschutz-anti-lgbtq-reports-fake-news-statement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8254682/philip-anschutz-elton-john-aids-foundation-donation\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8254682/philip-anschutz-elton-john-aids-foundation-donation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/new-examiner-to-offer-online-reporting-weekly-magazine\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/new-examiner-to-offer-online-reporting-weekly-magazine</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://mediadc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://mediadc.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/anschutz-company-buys-cruise-ships-resort-properties\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/anschutz-company-buys-cruise-ships-resort-properties</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://psmag.com/environment/how-a-conservative-billionaire-is-moving-heaven-and-earth-to-become-the-biggest-alternative-energy-giant-in-the-country\" target=\"_blank\">https://psmag.com/environment/how-a-conservative-billionaire-is-moving-heaven-and-earth-to-become-the-biggest-alternative-energy-giant-in-the-country</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/the-washington-examiner-local-news-team-says-goodbye-after-eight-years/article/2531904\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/the-washington-examiner-local-news-team-says-goodbye-after-eight-years/article/2531904</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/new-examiner-to-offer-online-reporting-weekly-magazine/article/2531880\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/new-examiner-to-offer-online-reporting-weekly-magazine/article/2531880</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/113504/113504\" target=\"_blank\">https://newrepublic.com/article/113504/113504</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/correction-108581\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/correction-108581</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/09/06/265307/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/09/06/265307/index.htm</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"washingtonexaminer.com","author":"Josh Keefe","date":"2018-11-02T20:06:13.165+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/washingtonexaminer.com/"}}
