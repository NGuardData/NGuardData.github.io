Univision has more than 100 national and local television and radio stations. Other sites owned by Univision include Deadspin, Gizmodo, Lifehacker, The Onion, and The Root. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Jezebel provides social commentary on topics found in both news and women’s magazines.  The Slot section covers politics and government. TWSS (That’s What She Said) presents “Shh! Girl Talk.” The Muse is devoted to arts and culture. The Barf Bag section provides an eclectic mix of stories with a stated mission to help readers’ navigate through the “chaotic Trumpian news cycle.” Jezebel’s menu allows readers to enter the site’s sections as well as those of other sites owned by Univision.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Many articles and headlines are written from a liberal, and often edgy and feminist perspective. Jezebel content exhibits strong sarcasm and frequently uses foul language. </p>\n<p>Writers’ opinions are usually blended into news stories. For example, in an article headlined “What the F*** Is This Roe v. Wade Movie?” the site’s culture editor writes that the film “features some of the confirmed worst people on the planet” and that “Nobody wants to be in this movie except for crazy people.”</p>\n<p>In a piece headlined “Weirdly, It Was Very Easy to Trick a Racist Man Into Being Racist on TV,” the writer says Republican Rep. Jason Spencer “hurtled his way into the dips*** hall of fame.” Spencer had unknowingly participated in an undercover satire show hosted by comedian Sacha Baron Cohen.</p>\n<p>In the site’s daily roundup of political news, one writer stated, “In addition to being a misogynist, Congressman Jason Lewis (R-MN) is a racist.”</p>\n<p>Some headlines can be newsy and straight-forward, such as “New Mexico Women Poised to Make History After Primaries.” Many, though, are hyperbolic, such as “Bill Clinton Gives Total Piece of S*** Answer to Question About #MeToo, Monica Lewinsky.” Some stories are sourced with original reporting, while many rely on other media outlets’ reporting, tweets, and other public information as a launching pad for personal observations.</p>\n<p>The site regularly publishes corrections by adding “[Updated]” in the headline and adding a note at the bottom that says “Correction” along with an explanation of what was changed in the article.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Stories include author names and usually link to the writer’s email and social media information. The site contains a list of editorial leaders and writers, with email and Twitter addresses. The site identifies itself as part of Gizmodo Media Group.</p>\n<p>Sponsored content is clearly labeled. Paid content that resembles articles appears in a section called The Inventory, with a note stating: “Commerce Content is independent of Editorial and Advertising, and if you buy something through our posts, we may get a small share of the sale.” </p>\n<p>The site provides a link to Gizmodo’s 2016 editorial code, which states that “We disclose our conflicts, air our biases, and show our work. We don’t pretend to know what we don’t.” The code adds that “Gizmodo Media Group sometimes receives a commission when readers buy products to which we link to in editorial posts.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site began in 2007 as part of the Gawker group of blogs and online publications.</p>\n<p>In 2016, professional wrestler Terry Bollea, better known as Hulk Hogan, won a $140 million verdict against Gawker for publishing videos of him having sex with a friend’s wife. Following the verdict, Gawker filed for bankruptcy protection and its media brands were sold to the privately owned parent company of Spanish-language broadcaster Univision in a bankruptcy auction.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nLarry Levin\n\nEdited by:\nSteven Brill&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://jezebel.com/262130/the-five-great-lies-of-womens-magazines\" target=\"_blank\">https://jezebel.com/262130/the-five-great-lies-of-womens-magazines </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/gizmodo-staff-torches-new-univision-exec-in-private-meeting-youre-about-to-enter-a-tornado-of-nightmares\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thedailybeast.com/gizmodo-staff-torches-new-univision-exec-in-private-meeting-youre-about-to-enter-a-tornado-of-nightmares </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/?s=jezebel\" target=\"_blank\">https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/?s=jezebel </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theslot.jezebel.com/melania-merrily-1826604602\" target=\"_blank\">https://theslot.jezebel.com/melania-merrily-1826604602 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thatswhatshesaid.jezebel.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://thatswhatshesaid.jezebel.com </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://themuse.jezebel.com/every-non-white-character-on-sex-and-the-city-1826192709\" target=\"_blank\">https://themuse.jezebel.com/every-non-white-character-on-sex-and-the-city-1826192709 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jezebel.com/the-dissonance-of-kate-spade-1826582092\" target=\"_blank\">https://jezebel.com/the-dissonance-of-kate-spade-1826582092 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theslot.jezebel.com/new-mexico-women-poised-to-make-history-after-primaries-1826602060\" target=\"_blank\">https://theslot.jezebel.com/new-mexico-women-poised-to-make-history-after-primaries-1826602060 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/gizmodo-media-groups-editorial-code-1787663938\" target=\"_blank\">https://gizmodo.com/gizmodo-media-groups-editorial-code-1787663938 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jezebel.com/5732075/about-jezebel-for-beta\" target=\"_blank\">https://jezebel.com/5732075/about-jezebel-for-beta </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/20/jezebel-website-changed-womens-media\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/20/jezebel-website-changed-womens-media </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/news/2016/08/18/gawker-com-will-shut-down-in-august-after-filing-for-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.snopes.com/news/2016/08/18/gawker-com-will-shut-down-in-august-after-filing-for-bankruptcy/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jezebel.com/search?q=correction\" target=\"_blank\">https://jezebel.com/search?q=correction</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theslot.jezebel.com/donald-trump-loves-everything-emmanuel-macron-says-even-1827518340\" target=\"_blank\">https://theslot.jezebel.com/donald-trump-loves-everything-emmanuel-macron-says-even-1827518340</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theslot.jezebel.com/thousands-of-low-income-people-are-about-to-lose-access-1827544886\" target=\"_blank\">https://theslot.jezebel.com/thousands-of-low-income-people-are-about-to-lose-access-1827544886</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jezebel.com/pete-davidson-bipolar-disorder-wont-stop-me-from-being-1826322045\" target=\"_blank\">https://jezebel.com/pete-davidson-bipolar-disorder-wont-stop-me-from-being-1826322045 </a></li>\n<li>What the Fuck Is This Roe v.
