Twitchy.com is run by Townhall Media, an affiliate of Salem Media. Townhall Media operates a variety of conservative online news platforms, including Townhall.com, Hotair.com, and Redstate.com. The site was founded by conservative commentator Michelle Malkin, author of “In Defense of Internment: The Case for ‘Racial Profiling’ in World War II and the War on Terror.” Malkin sold Twitchy to Salem Media in 2013 and no longer appears to have any direct involvement with the site.</p>\n<p>Twitchy.com runs advertisements and sponsored content. </p>\n<p>Salem Media’s About Us page states that the company targets “audiences interested in Christian and family-themed content and conservative values.” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Twitchy writers do no original reporting and instead construct stories by embedding tweets pulled from Twitter. The site’s About Us page states that Twitchy’s “kinetic staff of social media junkies…mine Twitter” for news. The site does not mention its political leanings or those of its parent company, Salem Media. </p>\n<p>Stories mostly cover statements made by political figures, including politicians and political journalists, and the reactions to those comments. Headlines often run with with images that have nothing to do with the topic of the article, such as pictures of a nuclear explosion and stills from movies and television shows, usually used to mock Democrats or mainstream journalists. For example, on the homepage on September 11, 2018, the site ran a picture of a baby laughing with the words “STOP STOP I’m gonna pee!” to illustrate a story about a journalist criticizing Facebook. </p>\n<p>Commentary written by the site’s authors usually consist of fewer than 100 words, and often includes insults directed at Democrats, liberals, and mainstream journalists.</p>\n<p>Sections listed at the top of the homepage include U.S. News, Media, Entertainment, and Cartoons.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>As the basis for its articles, the site largely uses tweets from conservative media personalities and publications, among them NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch and Breitbart News, as well as from random Twitter users. The site does not disclose a partisan or ideological orientation, yet almost exclusively runs stories that criticize Democrats and liberals and champion Republicans and conservatives. </p>\n<p>While Twitchy’s authors sometimes use the tweets of popular conservative commentators to build a story, they also select tweets from little-known Twitter users, many of whom do not disclose their real identities, in order to build a narrative. Many times, the tweets used to construct a story do not seem to be chosen based on their popularity, or the quality of the analysis or insight offered, but simply because they align with the author’s opinion, and in fact, take that opinion a step further toward ad hominem attacks.</p>\n<p>For example, in a September 11, 2018, story about Maine Senator Angus King comparing the 9/11 attacks to Russian attempts to influence the 2018 election, Twitchy ran the headline “‘YOU PIECE OF SH*T!’ Sen. Angus King draws APPALLING 9/11 comparison [video].” The quoted part of the headline was from a tweet included in the article from a twitter user with 710 followers who described himself as “A pissed off, Arizona Dad that won’t allow the #Communists to infect OUR STATE!” The tweet read “WHAT AN INCREDIBLE THING TO SAY! YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!!” The tweet had one like and one retweet.</p>\n<p>Another story that ran on the same day was entirely based on single twitter comment by the site’s founder, Michelle Malkin. (Twitchy did not mention Malkin’s relationship to the site.) In the tweet, Malkin declared “People hating more on President Trump than on murderous Islamic jihadists today are soul-damaged,” a commentary that the story’s author connected to criticism of Trump earlier in the day from CNN’s Chris Cillizza and MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough. The rest of the story was a collection of tweets that praised and agreed with Malkin, including “You have to have a soul for it to be damaged. These people are soulless” and “They have no souls!  Hate has eaten them up! They lost, poor little snowflakes!” </p>\n<p>Because the site is not clear about its political orientation and presents news in an opinionated and partisan manner, often employing cherry-picked information and buttressed by inflammatory tweets, NewsGuard has determined that the website does not handle the distinction between news and opinion responsibly.  </p>\n<p>Twitter is often criticized for coarsening discourse and serving as an echo chamber for users who only see tweets from users they agree with. But while a Twitter user might see a mix of politically diverse responses to a popular tweet, the person encountering the same conversation on Twitchy will nearly always only see the tweets that espouse the same views as the site’s writers.</p>\n<p>Because Twitchy often provides a platform for trolling and toxic internet discourse that amounts to little more than schoolyard name calling and does not appear to vet tweets for accuracy, NewsGuard has determined that Twitchy does not gather and present information responsibly. </p>\n<p>Twitchy headlines are hyperbolic and misleading, full of random capitalization, and in some cases, use words that do not exist in the English language. For example, the site sometimes starts headlines with the nonsensical term “BOOMITY!” as in the August 2018 headline “BOOMITY! Must-read threat takes SJWs APART for blaming acts of mass violence on ‘toxic masculinity.’</p>\n<p>Examples of misleading or sensational headlines that appeared on the site on September 6 and 7, 2018, included: “‘Drugs are BAD, mkay?’ Ian Millhiser just suffered a full-blown PSYCHOTIC BREAK over Brett Kavanaugh.” The story mocked an all-caps tweet by Ian Millhiser, an editor at the liberal ThinkProgress news site, about Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing performance. The beginning of the headline implied Millhiser was on drugs (using a popular line from the television show South Park) and then accused him of having a psychotic episode. Another headline from that two-day stretch included “‘LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL’! Apparently Barack Obama needs to spend MORE time in front of the mirror.” The entire article was Twitter reactions to former President Barack Obama stating in a speech that “We don’t need a messiah.” </p>\n<p>Another headline from September 7 said “‘She’s a LUNATIC’! Nancy Pelosi’s warning about Brett Kavanaugh is some FLAMING-HOT garbage.” The article ended with the line “All Dems have to do is not be insane. And they just...can’t...do it.”</p>\n<p>The commentary offered by Twitchy authors rarely provides facts, instead they typically add insults to the selected tweets. For example, a July 2018 article about an interview between journalist Ezra Klein and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is titled “Righties WANT open borders? WAT?! Ezra Klein talking Dem. Socialism with Bernie Sanders is COMEDY GOLD.” The article says of Sanders: “Wow, that old fart has lost his mind.”</p>\n<p>The site does not articulate a corrections policy and does not appear to regularly publish corrections.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard contacted the site through parent Salem Media via email and also left two voicemails, inquiring about Twitchy’s editorial standards, headlines, approach to corrections, and handling of the difference between news and opinion. The company did not respond.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Twitchy stories provide only the first name and last initial of authors, with the exception of one of the site’s seven staff members. The website’s About Us page lists the Twitter handles of Twitchy.com’s editorial staff. The About Us page gives no indication who edits or runs the site, and does not provide an email address or phone number for readers to contact the site.</p>\n<p>Twitchy.com only discloses that it is owned by Salem Media Group in a small copyright notice at the bottom of the site — which does not meet NewsGuard’s standard for disclosing ownership and financing in a user-friendly manner. Also, the site does not disclose its connection to Malkin, the site’s founder, including in articles that quote her.</p>\n<p>There is no way to contact Twitchy editorial staff directly through the site, and the site does not provide email addresses for its newsroom or individual staff.</p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard contacted the site through parent companies Salem Media and Townhall Media via email and also left two voicemails, inquiring about Twitchy’s lack of disclosure about its ownership, leadership, and content creators. The site did not respond.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Twitchy.com was founded in 2012 by Michelle Malkin, a conservative blogger and syndicated columnist. Malkin has written several books, including “In Defense of Internment: The Case for ‘Racial Profiling’ in World War II and the War on Terror.” Malkin sold Twitchy to Salem Media in 2013 and does not appear to be directly involved in the site.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label misspelled the name of ThinkProgress editor Ian Millhiser.</em></p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: Upon additional review, this Nutrition Label has been updated to indicate that the site does not provide information about its ownership and financing in a user-friendly manner.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJosh Keefe\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and
