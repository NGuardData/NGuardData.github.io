McClatchy generates the bulk of its revenue from subscriptions and advertising for its printed and digital products. </p>\n<p>McClatchy-owned newspapers have won numerous awards, including two Pulitzer Prizes in 2017.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p> The site covers news from the White House and Congress, as well as national and international politics from Washington. The site also hosts several politics-themed podcasts and showcases McClatchy editorial cartoons and opinion columnists. </p>\n<p>McClatchyDC.com was formed to create a single office for McClatchy reporters from local newspapers, the company said in an email to News Guard. McClatchyDC.com has 70 journalists -- about half of whom are dedicated to specific McClatchy newsrooms and regions, and others whose work is more national in focus. The McClatchydc.com team includes reporters who cover the White House, national security and national politics, as well as data journalists and columnists.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles on the site are fact-based and evenhanded. Headlines accurately represent the facts in articles.</p>\n<p>The website abides by the corrections policy of McClatchyDC.com, which states: “McClatchyDC.com will publish corrections and clarifications quickly, giving our audience clear and careful explanation for the error within the body of the story.” The site attaches corrections notices that explain the error and the change.</p>\n<p>In 2017, the bureau shared the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for explanatory reporting with the Miami Herald as a result of work on the Panama Papers investigation. The work explored an international tax haven that hid billions of dollars for dictators, politicians and tax cheats.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Authors of articles are clearly identified, and their email addresses and telephone numbers are provided. A link on the homepage connects users to McClatchy newsrooms around the country, and a Contact Us page lists the bureau’s mailing address. However, the website does not list the bureau’s top editors.</p>\n<p>Jeanne Segal, McClatchy director of public relations and communications told NewsGuard in 2019 that the bureau had taken down its About Us section because the content was outdated. Segal said the website planned to update the page to include contact information for top editors and details about McClatchy.</p>\n<p>Advertising is differentiated from editorial content. Sponsored content carries the label \"FROM OUR ADVERTISING PARTNERS.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>McClatchy was founded in 1857, and in 2006 it acquired rival publishing company Knight Ridder.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This Nutrition Label has been updated, and its rating has changed, after McClatchy changed the way it labeled paid content hosted by content recommendation firm ZergNet. The rating has changed to reflect that Mcclatchydc..com labels advertising.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEdith Honan\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114224828072596508\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114224828072596508</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mcclatchy.com/about/history\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mcclatchy.com/about/history</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/news/tribune-buys-out-mcclatchys-stake-mct-newswire\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.poynter.org/news/tribune-buys-out-mcclatchys-stake-mct-newswire</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/guantanamo/article223975080.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/guantanamo/article223975080.html</a></li>\n<li>Corrections</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/article216610445.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/article216610445.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/article216791995.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/article216791995.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article143772899.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article143772899.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zergnet.com/news/3667709/whats-come-out-about-sarah-huckabee-sanders\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.zergnet.com/news/3667709/whats-come-out-about-sarah-huckabee-sanders</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nickiswift.com/108985/untold-truth-sarah-huckabee-sanders/?utm_source=zergnet.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=zergnet_3667709&utm_content=286\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nickiswift.com/108985/untold-truth-sarah-huckabee-sanders/?utm<em>source=zergnet.com&#x26;utm</em>medium=referral&#x26;utm<em>campaign=zergnet</em>3667709&#x26;utm_content=286</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mcclatchydc.com/customer-service/contact-us/article206876009.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mcclatchydc.com/customer-service/contact-us/article206876009.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"mcclatchydc.com","author":"Edith Honan","date":"2019-02-25T18:10:42.617+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/mcclatchydc.com/"}}
