Digital First Media is a private company that owns nearly 100 newspapers in the U.S., including the Denver Post. Digital First generates revenue from subscriptions and advertising on its printed publications and digital products. It also operates AdTaxi, a programmatic advertising product for businesses.</p>\n<p>Digital First Media is owned by Alden Global Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that has been the subject of controversy for substantial staff cuts at Digital First Media properties. In 2018, staff at The Denver Post and the Bay Area News Group engaged in a series of public protests and editorials against Alden’s ownership, with The Denver Post publicly describing its owners as “vulture capitalists.”</p>\n<p>Dailynews.com’s revenue comes from advertisements and an online paywall.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Much of dailynews.com’s content is local interest reporting centered on the San Fernando Valley.
