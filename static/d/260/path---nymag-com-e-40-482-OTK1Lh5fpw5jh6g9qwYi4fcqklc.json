The New York-based company is owned by the Wasserstein family, heirs of the late investment banker Bruce Wasserstein, and operates five other U.S. offices as well as ones in Canada and Italy. New York Media does not disclose finances, but New York generates revenue through advertisements, sponsored posts, sponsorship of New York Media events, sales of its print magazine, and sales of products on The Strategist.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>NYMag.com is home to the online edition of New York magazine. The site is separated into sections for each of its media brands. Some brands are housed on NYMag.com: the political section Intelligencer, the technology section Select All, and the shopping guide The Strategist. Other sections operate their own sites linked to from NYMag.com: cultural content on Vulture, stories from a female perspective on The Cut, and restaurant guides on Grub Street. NYMag.com also provides free access to a web version of the current and past editions of its twice-monthly print magazine.</p>\n<p>Stories include original reports featuring firsthand interviews and short blurbs aggregated from other news outlets. The cover story of a June 2018 issue took a look inside Netflix, while an April 2018 issue profiled the late Roy Cohn, a controversial attorney and onetime counsel to Donald Trump. Some sections, like the Best of New York, cater to local readers, while other sections, like the U.S. politics section Intelligencer, serve a national audience. </p>\n<p>Topics on NYMag.com range from serious issues, such as Grub Street’s “Anthony Bourdain and the ‘Silent Epidemic of Male Suicide,’” to lighthearted stories, such as Vulture’s “I Ate a Home-cooked Italian Feast With the Jersey Shore Cast.”</p>\n<p>Much of New York’s coverage exhibits a strong liberal perspective, especially in its Intelligencer section. The section often features stories critical of conservative figures such as “Jeff Sessions Defends Family Separation With False Claim About Nazis’ Treatment of Jews” and “Inside the Disastrous White House Briefing on Trump’s Child-Separation Policy.”</p>\n<p>Regular contributors to New York include Frank Rich, a former columnist and chief drama critic for The New York Times, and Andrew Sullivan, former editor of The New Republic and influential blogger. NYMag.com also publishes sponsored stories it creates through paid partnerships with companies.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>NYMag.com publishes stories based on factual reporting or attributed to other established media outlets. Its original reporting has been influential, such as the cover story of its July 27 2015 issue, which told the stories of 35 women who accused Bill Cosby of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>New York has won more than 35 National Magazine Awards since 2004, receiving recognition for its print and online versions, including the award for best website in 2018. New York’s art critic Jerry Saltz won a Pulitzer Prize for criticism in 2018.</p>\n<p>The website exhibits a liberal slant in its curation and coverage of stories, although it does not disclose that it reports from a particular point of view. This slant is especially evident in the Intelligencer section, where straightforward news updates reside alongside opinionated columns, with neither being clearly labeled as news or opinion.</p>\n<p>For example, on October 30, 2018, Intelligencer posted a fact-based Tweet describing the announcement of Apple’s new MacBook Air, a Q&#x26;A on technology in rural China, and commentary articles critical of President Trump, which included “Trump: Our Plan Covers Pre-existing Conditions. It Does the Exact Opposite” and “Report: President Trump Barely Works At All.” That post states:  “Trump has done such a comprehensively awful job of being president that it feels petty, or even contradictory, to complain that he spends so little time doing it.” Asked about the magazine’s liberal orientation and its separation of news from opinion, New York’s Communications Manager Aude White told NewsGuard in an email: “New York publishes commentary from a range of political viewpoints that are often in tension with each other. The balance between reporting, analysis and opinion varies within each story.”</p>\n<p>Although the site does not state a corrections policy, White told NewsGuard that the site issues corrections as needed and updates stories accordingly. For example, when a New York reporter was misled by a New York high school student who claimed to have made $72 million and provided fabricated bank statements, New York appended the article with an extensive “Editor’s Note” at the top explaining their error.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site makes clear its connection to New York Media and its other brands, but it does not disclose its ownership by the Wasserstein family. Asked about the lack of specific ownership information, White told NewsGuard: “Per industry standards, New York Magazine discloses our ownership as such: ‘New York Media LLC is owned by New Media Holdings LLC which is owned by a private Trust.’”</p>\n<p>The Contact Us page provides email and mailing addresses for contacting managers in its various departments, but its staff is not listed centrally in a masthead on the site or in the print magazine. Articles contain bylines, which only sometimes provide contact information. Stories aggregated from other news sites link to their original sources.  </p>\n<p>Product features on The Strategist contain the following disclaimer: “If you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.” When asked about this practice, White told NewsGuard “The Strategist's business team has set up affiliate revenue relationships with thousands of retailers, which gives our writers the freedom to write about what they truly stand behind. In some cases, they will write about things they love which the site won’t get any affiliate revenue from.”</p>\n<p>Advertisements and sponsored stories are clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Graphic designer Milton Glaser and journalist Clay Felker founded New York--which was formerly a Sunday supplement in the now-defunct World Journal Tribune newspaper--as an independent magazine in 1968. The magazine aimed to be a more “working class” version of The New Yorker, according to Glaser. In 1977, media magnate Rupert Murdoch purchased New York. He sold the magazine to K-III Communications in 1991, which then sold the magazine to Bruce Wasserstein in 2004. The Wasserstein family took over in 2009, after Bruce died. The magazine’s website started in 2001 as NYMetro.com, later changing its name to NYMag.com.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This Nutrition Label and the criteria checklist have been updated to indicate
