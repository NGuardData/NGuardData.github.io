AT&#x26;T operates EHM Productions through its WarnerMedia division, the new name of Time Warner, formerly one of the largest media and entertainment companies in the world, which AT&#x26;T acquired in 2018 through an $85 billion deal.</p>\n<p>TMZ is financed through online advertisements. The site also sells tickets to the TMZ Celebrity Tour, its Hollywood sightseeing bus service.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>TMZ publishes news about celebrities. Its content is divided into News, Sports, Videos, Photos, and Celebs. Much of TMZ’s content features original reporting, often focused on celebrity breakups, scandals, lawsuits, crimes, illnesses, and deaths. News broken by TMZ is marked with a red “Exclusive” banner. Stories are based on anonymous tips and unnamed sources, videos, photographs, audio recordings, court documents, tweets, and, occasionally, on reporting by third-party news organizations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>TMZ has on multiple occasions broken high-profile stories. In 2006, TMZ’s report on Mel Gibson’s drunken anti-Semitic rant hindered the actor-director’s career for a decade. In 2009, the site was the first to report Michael Jackson’s death. In 2014, it published a transcript of an audio recording of Donald Sterling, then the owner of the L.A. Clippers, telling his girlfriend not to bring her black friends to a basketball game. He subsequently lost his ownership. A lawsuit by Sterling against TMZ was dismissed on the basis of free speech. In 2014, football player Ray Rice was suspended by the NFL after TMZ released a surveillance video showing Rice punching his fiancee in an elevator. In 2016, the site broke news of singer Prince’s death.</p>\n<p>TMZ relies almost exclusively on unnamed sources. According to a 2016 New Yorker profile of TMZ, “the site has built a deep network of sources, including entertainment lawyers, reality-television stars, adult-film brokers, and court officials.” A 2014 Buzzfeed article about TMZ described how “tipsters could be inside the legal system, inside an airline, or inside the celebrity family (Jackson and Lohan in particular). Everyone was a potential source, ready to be groomed and, if necessary, paid.” Indeed, TMZ occasionally pays for access to exclusive content, such as photographs or videos. On a 2014 episode of “Media Buzz,” TMZ founder Harvey Levin argued that TMZ’s policy of paying for photographs and videos is standard practice, that Fox News and other major media organizations do the same. He also said that TMZ does not pay sources for interviews.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard has determined that TMZ does not gather and present information responsibly, based on its failure to explain how it obtains information. TMZ often backs up reports with unnamed sources whose connection to the information is not described, and repeatedly invokes the phrase “TMZ has learned” without  providing any additional details. The site does not explain its sourcing practices, does not describe how it goes about getting information from sources, and does not disclose how or even if it it checks their credentials. In cases where TMZ names sources, it does not always provide information accurately. </p>\n<p>In October 2016, ProPublica reported that two of the three election officials interviewed for a TMZ article headlined “Some Officials Worry VOTING IS 'FLAWED PROCESS' OPEN TO FRAUD” denied the TMZ report. They said they did not tell TMZ that they were concerned about voter fraud. A colleague of one official who was present for the TMZ interview “confirmed that TMZ misreported the conversation.” According to ProPublica, a TMZ spokesperson said that the site “stands behind our story and it accurately reflects the information we were provided.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, in March 2013, TMZ was sued for placing hidden microphones in a courtroom during a Los Angeles Superior Court hearing involving a man named Alpha Walker, who had been accused of attempting to extort singer Stevie Wonder. Walker brought the case against TMZ. According to an article in the Hollywood Reporter, the “court's staff apparently was involved in the placement of the microphones.” After finding a hidden microphone on his bench, the judge announced, “I would like to state for the record that I was not aware of this microphone.” The article also quoted the deputy district attorney, who stated that he had never seen “a media organization surreptitiously record a bench officer, a DA and two defense attorneys.” Although the case against TMZ was dismissed in May 2013, NewsGuard determined that TMZ did not gather information responsibly in this instance.</p>\n<p>Since its founding in 2005, TMZ has repeatedly published stories that later turned out to based on false information. TMZ’s unusual reliance on unnamed sources and its determination to publish breaking news as quickly as possible helps explain why it repeatedly publishes false content. However, because TMZ routinely posts prominent corrections to such articles, the site does not fail NewsGuard's standard for publishing false stories, which, according to the wording of NewsGuard’s criterion, “have not been quickly and prominently corrected.” In 2009, for example, TMZ published an alleged image of John F. Kennedy “on a boat filled with naked women,” which was several hours later revealed to have been from a Playboy shoot produced several years after Kennedy’s death. Levin told the New York Times that TMZ consulted with “two forensics experts and two Kennedy biographers” as part of its “due diligence.” The site published a statement titled “Man in Photo is Not JFK,” explaining its mistake. In 2012, TMZ corrected a story that claimed Janet Jackson slapped Paris Jackson, stating: “TMZ published a story last week based on sources who told us Janet went off on Michael Jackson's daughter after the singer tried to grab Paris' cell phone... Although we believed the story to be true when we published it, we have now determined it was not correct. Janet did not slap or otherwise touch Paris, nor did she verbally abuse her.”</p>\n<p>TMZ did not respond to three NewsGuard messages inquiring about its news gathering practices.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles on tmz.com do not give the name of the writer, nor does the site disclose the names of anyone working at TMZ. Images and videos are sometimes not attributed. The site’s copyright language discloses that TMZ is owned by EHM Productions. The Privacy Policy and Terms &#x26; Conditions pages redirect to policies.warnerbros.com.</p>\n<p>The “Contact Us” page allows visitors to fill in a general form to “get in touch with the people at TMZ.com” with questions, comments, or corrections. The site has separate forms for media queries and “hot tips,” for which a contact form and phone number are also provided prominently on the site’s header.</p>\n<p>TMZ did not respond to three NewsGuard messages inquiring about the site’s lack of disclosure about its staff.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>TMZ was launched in 2005 by editor-in-chief Harvey Levin, an attorney and former television reporter. The site’s unconventional reporting methods (by 2005 standards) immediately shook the celebrity news industry. According to a 2016 New Yorker article about TMZ, a former photography director at US Weekly said, “They were coming up with things that we would never touch: cellphone pictures, video grabs, things that wouldn’t hold up in print.” Over the next decade, TMZ expanded to “TMZ on TV” and “TMZ Live,” its video newscasts, and launched TMZ Celebrity Tour buses. Though the site gained a reputation for lewd photographs and sexist headlines, its stories were increasingly picked up by major news organizations. In 2017, following his inauguration, President Trump granted Levin a meeting in the Oval Office.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling\n\nEdited by:\nJoyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;Yemile
