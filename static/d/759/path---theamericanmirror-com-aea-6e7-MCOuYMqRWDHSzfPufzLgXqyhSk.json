Olson has been a commentator on Fox News, a columnist with Townhall.com, and founded the Education Action Group Foundation, a Michigan organization that has promoted public school alternatives.</p>\n<p>During Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, TheAmericanMirror.com opened a “Hillary for Prison” Fund, which claimed to channel “every penny” towards “searching and reporting on Hillary, Bill and their cronies employing Saul Alinsky tactics to seize power.” According to the site, donations were not tax deductible.</p>\n<p>Advertisements run on the site.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>TheAmericanMirror.com publishes stories that cover U.S. politics while inserting opinions that are critical of Democratic politicians and some media outlets. The vast majority of the site’s articles are based on information from social media posts and other news outlets, including fringe and conspiracy sites such as InfoWars and Information Liberation, and conservative sites such as Breitbart.com.</p>\n<p>Articles are short, often a few paragraphs long, with headlines such as “QUEEN ANTIFA: Hillary says ‘cannot be civil’ with Republicans -- only thing they recognize is ‘strength’” and “MAXINE MELTDOWN: ‘I say impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment!” Stories include language that is supportive of the Trump administration and Republicans and critical of Democratic politicians such as former president Barack Obama, Clinton, and U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, a frequent critic of President Trump. Articles also frequently portray leading news outlets, in particular CNN, in a negative light. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The American Mirror has published multiple speculative stories without evidence that suggest several Democratic politicians have health problems. The politicians include Clinton, Waters, Pelosi, and former Vice President Joe Biden. The American Mirror has published several video montages of Clinton coughing at events to push the theory that Clinton is in poor health. For example, the October 2018 article “Hillary fights coughs after short campaign speech” used as sources two videos of Clinton – one compiled by the American Mirror. The author wrote that “sneaky Hillary Clinton tried to hide more coughing today by pretending to scratch her nose,” adding that “an alarmed look grew on Clinton’s face” in response to the coughing. But the video in question showed Clinton barely coughing once and showed no look of alarm. In 2016, while Clinton ran for president against Donald Trump, The American Mirror circulated a photo of  Clinton being helped up the stairs of a building with the headline “PHOTO: Multiple Staffers Help Unstable Hillary Up Stairs.” The fact checking site Snopes.com later wrote that while the photographs themselves were real, they had been taken five months before they were posted. </p>\n<p>The site has published articles that allege Pelosi has an “undisclosed health condition,” recounting instances in which Pelosi misspeaks or trips over her words. Headlines in 2018 include “NANCY? Pelosi gibberish, bizarre laughing; stares off during brain freeze,” “VIDEO: Saying ‘Constitution’ triggers Nancy Pelosi face spasm,” and “Pelosi suffers face spasm as she says Republicans are ‘afraid’ of her.”  And an October 2018 story about Waters, titled “Maxine Waters suffers brain glitch during attack on Trump,” referred to a pause Waters gave during a television interview that was critical of the president.</p>\n<p>The American Mirror’s publication of unproven health claims about Democrats, using selectively edited videos and images, has led NewsGuard to determine it does not gather and present information responsibly. Because it does not disclose its conservative perspective on the site -- describing itself only with the tagline “Reflections of our times &#x26; culture” -- and publishes stories that are highly critical of Democrats and supportive of conservative opinion, NewsGuard has determined that it does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. For example, a story about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’ November 2018 congressional victory speech in New York said that Ocasio-Cortez “continued her streak of making absurdly ridiculous statements.” And a story about a film producer who was booed at an Israeli festival for voicing opposition to Trump asserted, “Trump obviously understands and respects the Jewish people, and many were more than happy to defend their president.”</p>\n<p>NewsGuard could not find evidence that The American Mirror makes regular corrections.</p>\n<p>The site did not respond to two requests for comment via its online comment portal about its editorial practices, use of opinion in stories, and lack of corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The website does not disclose its ownership. Most articles are posted with author bylines, but there is no biographical information or contact information for them. Some articles are only credited to TheAmericanMirror.com. The site does not disclose who its top editors are.</p>\n<p>The site promotes a movie that Olson produced called “Dummycrats”, which was released in October 2018, by embedding ads for the film at the end of news stories, which NewsGuard has determined does not meet its standards for clearly labeling advertising. The site does not make clear that Olson was an executive producer of the movie, and that it was funded by a GoFundMe fundraiser managed by Olson.</p>\n<p>The site did not respond to two requests for comment via its online comment portal about its failure to disclose its owners, editors, content creators, and its placement of ads for the Olson-produced movie in news stories.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site’s URL was registered in December 2014.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nLillian Childress\n\nEdited by:\nJosh Keefe&#x26;emsp;Amy
