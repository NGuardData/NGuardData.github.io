NPR’s latest financial report, for 2018, showed operating revenues of $258.1 million. According to NPR’s website, 37 percent of its revenue comes from station dues and fees, and 29 percent of revenue comes from corporate sponsorships.</p>\n<p>In 2018, NPR reported, its staff numbered 379 reporters, editors, producers and others in its news and production departments. The site also generates revenue from display advertisements.</p>\n<p>NPR is governed by a 23-member board of directors, which includes 12 individual member station managers who are elected by the member stations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>NPR.org publishes written and audio content on national and international news, as well as art, food, music, books, television and movie reviews, and pop culture. Visitors to the site can also stream NPR programs and local stations on the site. NPR’s most prominent and popular programs such as “Morning Edition” and “All Things Considered,” which air during commuter drive time, benefit from large staffs of seasoned reporters based in Washington, and contributors reporting from around the world.</p>\n<p>The Politics page includes a fact check section, in which NPR explores the truth behind trending claims (e.g. “Is Trump Building A $250,000 Embassy In Jerusalem?”).</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Although NPR member stations generally receive 13 percent to 15 percent of their funding from federal, state, and local governments, the network and member stations operate under strict controls assuring that there is no governmental influence on their programming. Much of public radio’s best enterprise reporting involves exposing alleged government waste and wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>NPR often devotes more resources and air time to reporting on issues that get less coverage by  commercial news media, which depend more on ratings and advertising revenues.  The site’s daily offering of news, podcasts, and cultural coverage is serious, comprehensive, wide-ranging and generally scrupulous in gathering and reporting facts.</p>\n<p>Listeners and readers frequently debate whether the site has a liberal bias. One of its own former leaders has implied that it does. Former CEO Ken Stern spent a year after the U.S. election in 2016 traveling the country to understand better the partisan split in the country. “When you are liberal, and everyone else around you is as well, it is easy to fall into groupthink on what stories are important, what sources are legitimate and what the narrative of the day will be,” he wrote. “You can’t cover America from the Acela corridor, and the media need to get out and be part of the conversations that take place in churches and community centers and town halls. I did that, and loved it, though I regret waiting until well after I left NPR to do so.”</p>\n<p>Opinion pieces are clearly labeled. NPR employs an ombudsman who investigates complaints about NPR’s coverage and writes public reports about the organization’s internal workings, such as its handling of diversity and sexual harassment issues. She can be reached through the NPR website.The site features a corrections page that lists every correction made after 2004, with links to each respective article.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>All articles include bylines, which often link to a biography and, if relevant, the reporter’s Twitter account. NPR.org provides full biographies of most NPR staff members. Through the Contact page, visitors to the site can contact an NPR show or blog, send news tips, submit corrections, or contact a specific department.</p>\n<p>NPR’s finances are disclosed on its Finances page, which includes copies of annual financial reports and a breakdown of all sources of funding and expenses. Its annual reports list  corporate sponsors and other donors.</p>\n<p>Advertisements are clearly distinguished from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>NPR has its origins in the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. It was founded on February 26, 1970. The site was launched in 1993.</p>\n<p>In 2017, NPR’s head of news, Michael Oreskes, resigned amid accusations that women had accused him of sexual harassment while he was at NPR and years earlier while he was an editor at The New York Times. An outside review by a law firm found that NPR employees had repeatedly raised concerns about Oreskes to management throughout his two-year tenure at NPR.</p>\n<p>NPR’s president and chief executive at the time, Jarl Mohn, a veteran radio and television executive who helped create the cable channel E! Entertainment, apologized for his handling of the matter. In late 2018, he announced he would step down as CEO in June 2019 to take on a fund-raising role for NPR.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nSteven Brill\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie
