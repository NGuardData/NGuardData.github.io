{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<div class=\"right-score\">Score: 0</div>\n<h1>babylonbee.com&emsp; <span class=\"net-country\">(WEB - en-US)</span></h1>\n<p>A Christian satirical news website founded in 2016, publishing false “breaking” news aimed at American Christian conservatives.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>The Babylon Bee was launched in 2016 by Adam Ford, creator of the Christian comic site Adam4d and the Christian Daily Reporter news site. The Bee publishes humorous, fabricated  stories about real-life people and events, using file or stock photos and illustrations. The site has divided its satire into sections, including celebrities, Christian living, politics, sports, lifestyle and entertainment.</p>\n<p>The website clearly states at the bottom of each page that it is “Your Trusted Source For Christian News Satire.” There is a contact email for the site at the bottom of each page.</p>\n<p>Widely shared stories have been titled “Scholars: Jesus’ Disciples ‘Carefully Vetted’ All Children Before Letting Them Come To Him,” “House Democrats Draft Legislation That Would Make It A Hate Crime To Eat At Chick-Fil-A” and “Playing Christmas Music Before Thanksgiving Now A Federal Crime.”</p>\n<p>The Babylon Bee uses current events to poke fun at politicians and public figures, particularly Christian leaders. After televangelist Joel Osteen defended himself against criticism that his Houston church didn’t open its doors to residents flooded by Hurricane Harvey in August 2017, the Bee published a story titled, “Joel Osteen Sails Luxury Yacht Through Flooded Houston To Pass Out Copies Of ‘Your Best Life Now.’”</p>\n<p>The site also published a mock op-ed by New York Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 28, who upset party leader Joseph Crowley in a 2018 Democratic congressional primary. The fake column was headed “I Admit That I Have Absolutely No Idea What I’m Doing -- But You Better Believe I’m Going To Ride Out This Wave Just As Long As It Lets Me.”</p>\n<p>Although the site is clearly a spoof, fact checkers have nonetheless debunked a few of its stories. Some of the fact checks are shared with Facebook, which flags the Bee’s material as false to users. That curbs the site’s ability to share its content.</p>\n<p>The fact-checking website Snopes.com, for example, debunked the Bee’s pieces about the Chick-Fil-A legislation and the criminalization of Christmas music after readers questioned them. Snopes drew widespread criticism for its March 2018 debunking of a Babylon Bee story titled, “CNN Purchases Industrial-Sized Washing Machine To Spin News Before Publication,” which reported that the network bought the machine to help journalists “spin” the news before it is published. </p>\n<p>Snopes said in its fact checking piece, “Although it should have been obvious that the Babylon Bee was just a spoof of the ongoing political brouhaha over alleged news media ‘bias’ and ‘fake news,’ some readers missed that aspect of the article and interpreted it literally.” Snopes alerted Facebook that the story was “false,” which reduced the Babylon Bee’s ability to share its posts. Facebook later apologized and said the story should have been initially rated as satire.</p>\n<p>Ford sold the site in 2018 to Christian entrepreneur Seth Dillon. He said in a May 2018 blog post on adam4d.com that he wanted to focus on the Christian Daily Reporter and that he had become uncomfortable with The Babylon Bee’s dependence on Facebook and Google.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBron Maher\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;Joyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Stories mistaken for real</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>“Prime Minister Issues Friendly Reminder To UK Parents That The State Owns Their Children” (April 2018)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://babylonbee.com/news/prime-minister-issues-friendly-reminder-to-uk-parents-that-state-owns-their-children/&nbsp;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-uk-prime-minister-state-owns-children/\" target=\"_blank\">https://babylonbee.com/news/prime-minister-issues-friendly-reminder-to-uk-parents-that-state-owns-their-children/ https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-uk-prime-minister-state-owns-children/ </a></li>\n<li>“House Democrats Draft Legislation That Would Make It A Hate Crime To Eat At Chick-Fil-A” (June 2018)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://babylonbee.com/news/house-democrats-draft-legislation-that-would-make-it-a-hate-crime-to-eat-at-chick-fil-a/&nbsp;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chick-fil-a-crime-legislation/\" target=\"_blank\">https://babylonbee.com/news/house-democrats-draft-legislation-that-would-make-it-a-hate-crime-to-eat-at-chick-fil-a/ https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chick-fil-a-crime-legislation/ </a></li>\n<li>“Playing Christmas Music Before Thanksgiving Now A Federal Crime” (November 2017)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://archive.is/hGjRy#selection-971.0-971.63&nbsp;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/playing-christmas-music-federal-crime/\" target=\"_blank\">http://archive.is/hGjRy#selection-971.0-971.63 https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/playing-christmas-music-federal-crime/ </a></li>\n<li>“CNN Purchases Industrial-Sized Washing Machine To Spin News Before Publication” (March 2018)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://babylonbee.com/news/cnn-purchases-industrial-sized-washing-machine-spin-news-publication/\" target=\"_blank\">https://babylonbee.com/news/cnn-purchases-industrial-sized-washing-machine-spin-news-publication/ </a></li>\n<li>“When the Content Police Came for the Babylon Bee” (June 2018)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/when-the-content-police-came-for-the-babylon-bee/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/when-the-content-police-came-for-the-babylon-bee/ </a></li>\n<li>“No, CNN did not buy a big washing machine to spin the news” (March 2018)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2018/03/cnn_washing_machine_spin_news.html?__vfz=rtw_top_pages%3D2814900014949\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2018/03/cnn<em>washing</em>machine<em>spin</em>news.html?_<em>vfz=rtw</em>top_pages%3D2814900014949</a></li>\n<li>I got interested and went looking into this to see why it happened.
