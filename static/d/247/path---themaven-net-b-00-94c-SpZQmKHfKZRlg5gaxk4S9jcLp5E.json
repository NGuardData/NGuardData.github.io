{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<div class=\"right-score\">Score: 0</div>\n<h1>themaven.net&emsp; <span class=\"net-country\">(WEB - en-US)</span></h1>\n<p>A shared digital publishing, advertising, and distribution platform for a variety of independent publishers including journalists, authors, analysts, and advocates.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<h3>Financing</h3>\n<p>The Maven is publicly on the over-the-counter market under the ticker symbol MVEN. It debuted as a public company in October 2016, backed by MDB Capital Group. The company’s founder and CEO is James Heckman, a former head of global media strategy at Yahoo!. Its quarterly SEC filing for the period ending March 31, 2018, list revenue of only $86,685 and declared that the company will need to raise additional funds to stay in business. The company says it derives revenue from advertising and membership fees.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Maven, from a Yiddish word that means expert or connoisseur, bills itself as a coalition of independent publishers who have expertise in niche subjects. Its network of publishing partners cover topics ranging from finance and money management to arts and lifestyle. These channels are largely special interest publications, such as parenting-focused Today’s Mama, as well as news-oriented channels representing a variety of political perspectives, such as Blue Lives Matter, which covers news of interest to police officers and has a decidedly pro-law enforcement slant.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Maven is a platform and not a media site. It does not publish any content itself, and says it does not exercise editorial control over content published. However, as outlined in its Terms of Use, the Maven retains the right to take down content, including that which “is patently offensive and promotes racism, bigotry, hatred or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual,” contains offensive or violent subject matter, exposes personal information/data of third parties, or violates federal or state laws. The Maven says it does not own or retain the rights to the content published on the platform.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Information about the platform’s network, sources of funding, and leadership team is all accessible on its website. Additionally the website has several reports available for investors and would-be partners, including its finances and growth metrics. Contact information for the site can be found on the “About” page.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>TheMaven’s founders announced the platform in October 2016 and launched in early 2017. At the same time, they also announced an acquisition deal with Integrated Surgical Systems, Inc. In January 2018, Maven bought HubPages, an independent publishing website.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nVittoria Elliott\n\nEdited by:\nEric Effron&#x26;emsp;Yemile Bucay&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.themaven.net/the-maven/investors\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.themaven.net/the-maven/investors </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.themaven.net/the-maven/investors/themaven-inc-schedules-third-quarter-2017-earnings-release-conference-call-for-november-16-2017-ChGwPA6O8kOqSMCg2lrTww/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.themaven.net/the-maven/investors/themaven-inc-schedules-third-quarter-2017-earnings-release-conference-call-for-november-16-2017-ChGwPA6O8kOqSMCg2lrTww/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.themaven.net/the-maven/investors/about-maven-8IKseY_wP0SZjViTMr6MQA\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.themaven.net/the-maven/investors/about-maven-8IKseY_wP0SZjViTMr6MQA </a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://adexchanger.com/platforms/not-ad-network-heck-james-heckman-maven/\" target=\"_blank\">https://adexchanger.com/platforms/not-ad-network-heck-james-heckman-maven/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.themaven.net/the-maven/investors/the-maven-team-gEVDu7uElUCKT-VLmhX2dA\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.themaven.net/the-maven/investors/the-maven-team-gEVDu7uElUCKT-VLmhX2dA </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.themaven.net/the-maven/investors/maven-1-0-platform-launch-the-data-is-in-9kWbj_AtEUGYakyWDfwCOw\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.themaven.net/the-maven/investors/maven-1-0-platform-launch-the-data-is-in-9kWbj_AtEUGYakyWDfwCOw </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180131005653/en/Maven-Partners-Blockchain-Based-Media-Platform-Po.et-Empower\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180131005653/en/Maven-Partners-Blockchain-Based-Media-Platform-Po.et-Empower</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"themaven.net","author":"Vittoria Elliott","date":"2018-07-20T14:05:38.798+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/themaven.net/"}}
