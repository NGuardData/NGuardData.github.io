According to Commentary’s About page, members of its board of directors include billionaire Republican mega-donor Paul Singer and lawyer Jay Lefkowitz, a political appointee in U.S. President George W. Bush’s administration.</p>\n<p>Commentary generates revenue from print advertisements, donations, and print and digital subscriptions. According to the nonprofit’s 2016 IRS filings, its annual revenue totaled nearly $3 million, with more than $2 million from contributions and grants.</p>\n<p>After reading a limited number of free articles per month, online readers are prompted to buy a subscription for full site access.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>CommentaryMagazine.com provides originally produced opinion and analysis on politics, religion, and culture, often from a conservative and pro-Israel perspective. In its About section, Commentary describes itself as “America’s premier monthly magazine of opinion and a pivotal voice” that “emerged as the flagship of neoconservatism in the 1970s.” The site states that it focuses on “the future of the Jews, Judaism, and Jewish culture in Israel, the United States, and around the world; and the preservation of high culture in an age of political correctness and the collapse of critical standards.”</p>\n<p>The site divides its content into sections including Must Reads, Daily Commentary, Monthly Commentaries, Latest Podcasts, Politics &#x26; Ideas, and Culture &#x26; Civilization. Typical articles have run under headlines such as  “Is Russia Ready for Another Land Grab in Ukraine?” “The Counterrevolution on Campus,” and “Words Spoken to My Daughter, One Week After the Horrors at the Tree of Life Synagogue.”</p>\n<p>Commentary produces several podcast episodes per week, generally on U.S. politics.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>While Commentary articles usually include the writer’s views, articles are typically fact-based and well-sourced. Much of the content is consistent with the pro-Israel and conservative perspective the site has disclosed, including stories published in late 2018 about the “liberalization” of U.S. college campuses, and the International Criminal Court’s “blatant anti-Israel bias.” </p>\n<p>The magazine often presents multiple perspectives on controversial topics, including Israel and its leadership. For example, a November 2018 story titled “The Israeli Government Descends into Crisis,” described comments by conservative Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an “astonishingly detached-from-reality thought bubble.”</p>\n<p>The magazine has been critical of Democrats and Republicans alike, including U.S. President Donald Trump. A December 2018 article, titled  “As Legal Woes Mount, Trump’s Defenders Are Adrift,” questioned Republican supporters’ “shrugged shoulders” approach to charges that U.S. President Donald Trump colluded with Russian operatives to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. “Betting on partisan rationalizations to save the president is a risky gamble,” the article stated, “in part because it cedes the initiative to those investigating Trump and his associates. And at the moment, they have all the momentum.”</p>\n<p>Because the site discloses its perspective and does not misstate or distort facts to advance an agenda, NewsGuard has determined that Commentary handles the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>The site does not articulate a corrections policy and NewsGuard could not find recent corrections. Commentary did not respond to two emails and one voicemail from NewsGuard seeking comment on its approach to corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles are published with author names and typically include their title, a brief biography, and a social media handle. CommentaryMagazine.com’s About Us section includes names and titles of the magazine’s top editors and board of directors. </p>\n<p>The site identifies its owner as the nonprofit Commentary Inc. on its Donate page. However, it does not disclose any major donors, which does not meet NewsGuard’s standard for nonprofits’ disclosure of ownership and financing.</p>\n<p>The site did not respond to two emails and one voicemail from NewsGuard seeking comment on its ownership disclosure.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Commentary was founded in 1945, in the wake of World War II, by the American Jewish Committee, according to the site’s About page, and became a leading publication of Jewish affairs. Over the years, the magazine has published notable writers such as novelists Saul Bellow, Norman Mailer, and Philip Roth as well as American diplomat Jeane Kirkpatrick and conservative economist Thomas Sowell.</p>\n<p>Originally, the magazine leaned liberal, but its political orientation became more conservative by the early 1970s. Its editor at the time, Norman Podhoretz, became known as one of the founders of neoconservatism, a political movement that favors a more interventionist U.S. foreign policy and promotion of U.S. values abroad.</p>\n<p>In 2007, the magazine established Commentary Inc. as an independent nonprofit to take over as its publisher.</p>\n<p>In 2016, current editor John Podhoretz joined a group of conservative writers who published a series of essays titled “Against Trump” in National Review, a leading conservative journal. “Trump is an unbalanced force. He is the politicized American id,” Podhoretz wrote. “Should his election results match his polls, he would be, unquestionably, the worst thing to happen to the American common culture in my lifetime.”  </p>\n<p>Following the 2016 U.S. election of President Donald Trump, Commentary’s circulation increased by more than 20 percent, the Washington Post reported.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written
