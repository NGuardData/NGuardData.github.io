Aurora Media’s holdings also include ThePoliticalInsider.com, a site that NewsGuard has determined publishes false and misleading content. The company’s founder and chief executive officer is Kevin Lucido.</p>\n<p>Lucido is also the founder and CEO of Intermarkets, an advertising company that solicits advertisements from conservative political action committees and publishes them on largely conservative sites, including the Drudge Report, CNSNews.com and WayneDupree.com. Intermarkets is listed as the registrant of the Tmn.today domain name, according to the domain registry WHOIS. </p>\n<p>According to Federal Election Commission records, in 2015 and 2016, Intermarkets received over $88,000 in payments from the Republican National Committee for advertising and list acquisition, the practice of buying lists of people’s street addresses, phone numbers, or email addresses. Since 2007, Intermarkets has received more than $1,322,789 from conservative groups for services including online ads, email list purchases and fundraising phone calls. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site focuses on entertainment, lifestyle and political news, along with viral videos, such as a video of two people and their dog being rescued from a truck that had been driven into water. In most of these stories, articles reference Christian faith, even in stories otherwise unrelated to religion. For example, an August 2018 story about teachers donating unused sick days to a colleague diagnosed with cancer ends with “Our country was founded on Christianity and generosity. That selfless love for others continues and is evident in stories like this.”</p>\n<p>The site’s content has changed since it was first launched, as shown by a shift in its description on the About page. In May 2016, the site described itself as “home to the hottest stories, hacks, and videos on the web. From breaking news to breakthrough tips – we’re not afraid to tackle the issues, secrets, and guilty pleasures national outlets won’t touch.” By 2018, the description had changed to mention a partisan lean while asserting the site presented factual information: “We showcase tales of traditional American values, and the truth about what happens when those conservative values are abandoned. Our stories focus on entertainment, faith, family, and politics.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>TMN.today repeatedly published false -- and uncorrected -- stories in 2015 and 2016, including the “Pizzagate” claim that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was involved in a child sex ring run out of a Washington pizza restaurant, and that a human trafficking researcher was killed in Haiti investigating Clinton’s connections to the trafficking operation. It published a story in November 2016 saying Clinton and her campaign chairman, John Podesta, participated in a “Satanic dinner,” an allegation which NBC News later reported a Russia-based Twitter “troll” operation had promoted in the days before the 2016 presidential election. </p>\n<p>An October 2016 story headlined “Pope Benedict XVI Forbids Catholics From Voting for Hillary!” </p>\n<p>wrongly identified Benedict as the pope in 2016 -- he resigned in 2013 -- and misstated the contents of a letter he wrote in 2004, when he was a cardinal. While the TMN.today story reported that the letter forbid Catholics “from voting for pro-abortion Hillary Clinton or anyone who espouses her ideas,” the letter instead discussed whether Catholics are worthy of receiving communion if they vote for political candidates who support abortion rights or euthanasia. It did not mention Clinton or any other candidate.</p>\n<p>Articles published on the site in April and May 2015 supported unfounded conspiracy theories about Jade Helm 15, a U.S. military training exercise being conducted across several southwestern U.S. states. One article reported, “many see it as a dry run for martial law.” As The New York Times reported in September 2015, the Jade Helm exercise ended without altercations between the military and civilians. TMn.today also cited anonymous sources, including a “suspicious American,” in April 2015 to support a story linking closures of Walmart stores to Jade Helm. The story reported that government agencies were using the closed stores as an underground tunneling system to move “very large equipment and large numbers of people in case of national emergency.”</p>\n<p>Researchers from Dartmouth College and Princeton University included Tmn.today in an analysis of traffic to partisan fake news websites during October and November 2016. They analyzed the 25 websites with the most traffic, which had published at least two articles identified as false news by third-party fact-checking organizations. They classified it as a pro-Donald Trump site. </p>\n<p>In May 2017, the site published a story under the headline “Trey Gowdy Says There May Have Been Collusion Between Hillary Clinton and James Comey.” The story links to an interview with South Carolina congressman Gowdy where he only says, with no evidence, that Clinton thought the Obama Justice Department -- not Comey, who was working independently -- was working to protect Clinton.</p>\n<p>In more recent stories, after the site changed its focus to “entertainment, faith family and politics,” Tmn.today shifted toward mixing conservative opinion into entertainment news and articles, often with sensationalized headlines. For example, an August 2018 story, as well as an accompanying video, titled “Man Eats Raw Meat At A Vegan Festival – ‘Peaceful’ Vegans Get Violent!” does not describe any violence. The story was credited to the site Unilad UK, whose version of the article also made no mention of violence.  </p>\n<p>The site’s stories regularly treat writers’ conservative opinions as fact, especially when they relate to President Donald Trump or his policies. For example, an August 2018 article on a drop in the ratings for MTV’s Video Music Awards asserted the show was less popular because host Kevin Hart and other performers mocked Trump on the show. The ratings drop “proves once and for all that Americans of all ages are sick and tired of awards shows being politicized,” the story’s author wrote.</p>\n<p>TMN.Today writers add commentary, but not factual reporting, to accounts from other organizations, which include news organizations ranging from the entertainment program Inside Edition to the conservative Western Journal. The sources are inconsistently attributed. Other stories are based on celebrities’ and other social media posts.</p>\n<p>A NewsGuard review found no evidence of past or recent corrections of factual errors on the site. Because of TMN.Today’s repeated publishing of false content that have not been quickly and prominently corrected and retracted, NewsGuard has determined that the site publishes false content and fails to gather and present information responsibly. It has also determined the site doesn’t handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly for inserting politically conservative and Christian opinion into unrelated news stories without fully disclosing these opinions.</p>\n<p>The site did not respond to two emails from NewsGuard and a voicemail asking about its history of publishing false and misleading content, its lack of corrections, its use of opinion in news stories, use of questionable sources, and its insertion of opinion into news stories.</p>\n<p>Aurora Media, the site’s parent company, did not respond to an additional email by NewsGuard.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>TMN.Today credits writers on articles. Clicking on a writer’s name will redirect readers to an archive of the author’s work, but no biographical or contact information is provided. No information is provided about editorial leadership or ownership.</p>\n<p>Ads on the site are clearly labeled. The Contact Us page includes a general contact form, a general email address and a phone number.</p>\n<p>Intermarkets, the parent company of Aurora Media, is listed in the site’s privacy policy and lists TMN.today on its own site. But the site’s ownership is otherwise not disclosed.</p>\n<p>The site did not respond to two emails from NewsGuard and a voicemail asking about its ownership disclosure, information about content creators and editorial leaders, and its disclosure of a partisan affiliation. Aurora Media did not respond to an additional email sent by NewsGuard.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The site was launched by Aurora Media in 2013.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJohn
