The site runs advertising and features a paywall that requires visitors to purchase either print or online subscriptions to access most content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Republican-American publishes news and features about towns and communities in northwest Connecticut. The site’s sections include Local, News, Sports, Life &#x26; Arts, Obits, and Opinion. Many stories on the site are hyperlocal, such as “Lakewood Park swimming area to reopen at 11 a.m. today,” “Two-car crash on Route 8 in Watertown cleared,” and “3 private gardens open to public Saturday.” The site runs national and international news provided by The Associated Press. The site also features local cultural, entertainment, and restaurant reviews. The Opinion section features letters to the editor, editorials, and syndicated columns.</p>\n<p>The site features a “high school sports zone,” which covers the region’s high school athletics.</p>\n<p>The site’s History page discloses the newspaper’s philosophical outlook: “The Republican-American has a socially and fiscally conservative editorial stance. It advocates pro-business government policies, such as tax cuts and regulatory reform. The Republican-American is quick to blow the whistle on wasteful use of tax dollars, as well as unnecessary growth of local, state or federal government. The newspaper is a frequent critic of the demands of organized labor, especially public-employee unions, arguing they compel governments and businesses to spend beyond their means.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Republican-American’s staff reporters provide original first-hand reporting. Images are original or credited to outside providers, and headlines accurately represent content. Opinion is separated from news content.</p>\n<p>The website does not articulate a corrections policy, but it regularly publishes corrections and clarifications, in the form of  a notice at the top of stories explaining what was corrected.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Many articles on the site do not name the author. In an email to NewsGuard, Republican-American Managing Editor Anne Karolyi said that the outlet “generally [does] not have bylines on briefs in print, and that tradition has carried into briefs and breaking news updates on rep-am.com.” She added that “if a more complete story is filed later, that would carry a byline.“</p>\n<p>The site features a Newsroom page that names and provides contact and biography details for reporters and editors. Advertisements are clearly labeled. The site discloses its ownership.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Republican-American grew out of a merger between the Waterbury American, which was founded in 1844, and the Waterbury Republican, founded in 1881. The Pape family acquired full ownership of the Republican in 1910 and of the American in 1922. The two papers were combined into the Republican-American in 1990.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nBron Maher\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Eric
