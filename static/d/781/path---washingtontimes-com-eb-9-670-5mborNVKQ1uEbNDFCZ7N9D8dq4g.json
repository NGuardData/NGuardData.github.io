Church founder Rev. Sun Myung Moon, a self-described messiah and cult-like figure who died in 2012, invested more than $1 billion in The Washington Times during its first 20 years. </p>\n<p>Operations Holdings Inc. owns The Washington Times through one of its subsidiaries, TWT Holdings LLC, which was registered in 2010. The Unification Church owns Operations Holdings Inc. It also owns or controls hotels, schools, and other media outlets and businesses.</p>\n<p>The Unification Church has said that these holdings generate tens of millions of dollars each year.</p>\n<p>In October 2015, The Washington Times reported that in September of that year, it had achieved its first profitable month, despite losses exceeding $1 billion since it was founded.</p>\n<p>The Washington Times earns revenue from advertising, sponsored content, and subscriptions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Washington Times publishes news and commentary about local, national, and international issues, most often with a conservative bent. Balanced, fact-based reporting runs on the site as well. Coverage includes politics, national and international security, business, religion, entertainment, and sports. The site promotes photo galleries and videos. Articles are largely written by Washington Times staff. Wire services such as The Associated Press also contribute content.</p>\n<p>The site’s conservative tilt is evident in the stories it chooses to cover, and the angles from which it writes them. A prominently featured article from July 2018, for example, on noncitizen voting in local and school board elections, took an alarmist angle and did not adequately explain why some localities are pushing for these rights. “Forget the Russian government — foreign nationals are increasingly gaining the ability to influence American elections more directly,” read the article, which also included opposing views, but featured much less prominently. A related Los Angeles Times story from July 2018 on a related subject -- a former Republican congressman’s push to block noncitizen voting in California -- explained the congressman’s position, but also explained the government’s rationale for approving such measures: to give immigrants a voice in their communities. </p>\n<p>Coverage of the Trump administration, much of which appears in a section called Trump Central, is often cherry picked and written to present the president in a positive light. The site also publishes critical coverage, but to a lesser extent. For example, reports on President Donald Trump’s policy of separating migrant children from their parents, which was widely condemned in other major media outlets and by both Democratic and Republican elected officials, were far less disparaging in The Washington Times. One article reported that “broadcast networks’ news coverage of President Trump’s immigration policy has been stunningly negative,” and referred to those affected by the policy as “‘victims,’” in quotes. The Trump Central section — which appears within the site’s news section — also runs the president’s Twitter and Facebook feeds alongside news coverage, under the prominent label “Connect with Donald Trump.”</p>\n<p>WashingtonTimes.com publishes a robust opinion section, which is overwhelmingly conservative. Opinion content appears in a dedicated section and an “analysis/opinion” label is included at the beginning of each article.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>News stories published by The Washington Times, although often apparently selected to conform to the publication’s conservative outlook, are generally fact-based, citing multiple expert sources of varying perspectives and firsthand information such as primary documents and peer-reviewed studies. Liberal perspectives are sometimes included in these articles, although they tend to be down-played.  </p>\n<p>The Washington Times has run conspiracy theories and falsehoods in its opinion sections. The paper published an editorial and three columns between 2009 and 2012 questioning whether President Barack Obama is a Christian and implying that he is (or was raised as) a Muslim: An August 2010 editorial was headlined “The first presumed Muslim president,” and a July 2010 opinion piece called Obama a “cultural Muslim.” A column in 2008 supported the false theory that he was born in Kenya.</p>\n<p>The Washington Times has had close ties to Republican presidential administrations — President Ronald Reagan called it his favorite paper — and it has also served as a platform for many well-known conservative journalists, including Tony Snow and Tony Blankley. Prominent opinion columnists have included former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich and conservative pundit Michelle Malkin. </p>\n<p>The Washington Times regularly publishes corrections and updates articles.</p>\n<p>Articles about the Moon family and the Unification Church are not objectively reported. Rev. Sun Myung Moon’s lengthy obituary in 2012 focused largely on church successes, and went into extensive detail about Unification Church teachings. The New York Times obituary of Moon went into much greater detail about the many controversies surrounding the Unification Church.</p>\n<p>The Washington Times has written publicly that the Unification Church does not exert any editorial control, but staff have continually refuted this claim and one-third of the newspaper’s original editorial staff were church members. “The Washington Times today is the most unprofessional and dishonest organization I have ever encountered,” Anneke Green, former deputy op-ed editor wrote in her 2012 resignation letter. “I can’t continue to spend the lion’s share of my professional time fighting unethical practices being pushed by top leaders in the company.” </p>\n<p>Aaron Rich, the brother of slain Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, sued the Times in March 2018, alleging it published a column promoting a false theory that Rich was killed because he shared DNC emails with WikiLeaks. Law enforcement authorities said Rich was killed after a botched robbery in 2016. As part of a settlement with Rich in the fall of 2018, The Washington Times issued a retraction and apology for the column and removed the column from the site. “The Washington Times apologizes to Mr. Rich and his family,” the retraction read. Further terms of the settlement were not disclosed.</p>\n<p>Wesley Pruden, a former editor in chief who regularly ran excerpts from racist, right-wing publications during a 16-year tenure, is now the paper’s editor emeritus and writes a twice-weekly opinion column.</p>\n<p>Christopher Dolan, executive editor of The Washington Times, and Ian Bishop, the paper’s digital editor, did not respond to three NewsGuard emails and four voicemails seeking comment about The Washington Times’ relationship with the Unification Church, the lawsuit on the Seth Rich column, and its history of reporting conspiracy theories and falsehoods.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Articles on WashingtonTimes.com name the author and link to an archive of the writer’s work and, in some instances, short biographies. Most writers provide their email address and/or a link to their Twitter profile. Author names are also included on the site’s home page and on main section pages.</p>\n<p>A Contact Us page lists names, titles, email addresses, and phone numbers of top editors and columnists at The Washington Times, as well as those of managers in its advertising and marketing division. The page also includes the paper’s main phone line and general email addresses for letters to the editor and the opinion section. Readers can comment on articles.</p>\n<p>WashingtonTimes.com does not sufficiently acknowledge its relationship to TWT Holdings, LLC, Operations Holdings, Inc. or the Unification Church, although its connection to the church is widely known.</p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguishable from editorial content and sponsored content is clearly marked.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Moon founded The Washington Times in 1982. It was intended to be “another source of news and information in the nation’s capital,” according to a March 1982 article in The Washington Post. The WashingtonTimes.com domain name was registered in 1998.</p>\n<p>Under the leadership of Pruden, from 1992 to 2008, the paper covered white nationalist conferences and regularly ran excerpts from racist, right-wing publications such as VDARE and commentary by neo-Nazi Bill White. Pruden also ran a full page in The Washington Times’ Saturday print edition dedicated to the Civil War, which often glorified the Confederacy. </p>\n<p>He left The Washington Times after allegations of racism and sexim in the paper’s newsroom had circulated for several years.  Five separate editors have held the position since 2008. Dolan has been in the top spot since 2015.</p>\n<p>Moon handed control of the paper to his oldest surviving son, Hyun-jin (Preston) Moon, in 2006. </p>\n<p>Amidst family infighting for control over the Unification Church’s many operations and a decline in advertising income at The Washington Times, the paper’s three top executives were fired in 2009.</p>\n<p>Kook-jin (Justin) Moon, who had been given control of many of the church’s Asian businesses,  cut off most of the paper’s annual subsidy around that time, which The Washington Post reported to be about $35 million. Amid these financial woes, the elder Moon moved ownership of the newspaper to another company in 2010, which also assumed the paper’s debts. The transfer was made for $1. </p>\n<p>Moon founded the Unification Church in South Korea in 1954 and brought it to prominence in the United States in the early 1970s.</p>\n<p>The elder Moon was convicted of filing false income tax returns and of conspiracy to defraud the federal government in 1982. He served 13 months of an 18-month sentence.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this Nutrition Label incorrectly reported that the newspaper’s Civil War page ran on Sundays; it appeared in
