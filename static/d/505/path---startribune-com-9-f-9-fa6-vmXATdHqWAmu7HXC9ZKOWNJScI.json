Star Tribune Media Company was purchased in 2014 by Glen Taylor, a Minnesota-born billionaire who is the founder and chairman of the Minnesota-based Taylor Corporation, a privately held print marketing company. Taylor also owns the Minnesota Timberwolves basketball team and the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx. He was a Republican member of the Minnesota State Senate in the 1980s.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The site focuses on political, business and sports news from Minnesota, while also highlighting major news from Washington and around the world. Coverage is divided into sections including Local, Sports, Business, Opinion, and Variety. The final section includes stories on lifestyle and entertainment. Headlines range from “Minnesota's new bear spotting tool is surprisingly active” to “New shop brings the millennial cactus craze to Minneapolis.” National and international coverage on the site is reported by The Associated Press.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Star Tribune maintains a robust staff of reporters and editors. Its newsroom has 245 staff members, publisher Michael Klingensmith told NewsGuard. In 2013, the paper won two Pulitzer Prizes for a series on infant deaths at poorly regulated home daycare facilities, and for editorial cartoons by the Star Tribune’s long-time cartoonist Steve Sack.</p>\n<p>Headlines and stories are objective and fact-based. The Star Tribune separates opinion pieces from its news coverage, publishing the former exclusively in its opinion section.</p>\n<p>The site attributes all images featured in its stories. Articles cite credible sources like first-hand interviews. Readers can submit suggestions for corrections, which are run as separate featured items headlined “Correction” and show the date of the original article. Corrections to Associated Press stories are published in a similar manner.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The website offers much of the content found in the print newspaper, including the Star Tribune’s liberal-leaning editorials and political endorsements. The paper frequently endorses Democrats, but in 2008 it endorsed Republican Norm Coleman for U.S. Senate over his Democratic challenger Al Franken. (Franken won the race, and the paper endorsed him for re-election in 2014. He has since resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations.)</p>\n<p>Stories written by staff members are clearly labeled with the name of the author. The author’s phone number, email address, and Twitter profile can be found at the bottom of a story. Readers can also click on a writer’s name to read his or her bio. The site’s staff directory  lists each member of the newsroom. Readers can contact specific staff members through information provided in the directory and individual articles, and can also  reach the newsroom through a general phone number on the site’s contact page.</p>\n<p>The site’s copyright statement says that the Star Tribune is owned by Star Tribune Media Company, LLC. Although most executive staff members of the company are not listed in the newspaper’s directory, Star Tribune Media Company, LLC’s website includes a page on its leadership that features a list of executive staff members, with bios and contact information for each individual.</p>\n<p>The site clearly labels advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>While the online edition launched in 1996, the paper’s history goes back to 1867, when it was known as the Minneapolis Tribune. The Star Tribune was part of the McClatchy Company, the publicly traded newspaper publisher, for nearly two decades, until McClatchy sold the paper in 2006. After the paper filed for and emerged from bankruptcy in 2009, its creditors became its majority owners, until Taylor bought the paper in 2014.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nNina Zweig\n\nEdited
