It relies on advertising, memberships and a percentage of purchases made when readers click on a link from an article to Amazon.com. The site and multiple podcasts are free, but it offers benefits to members for an extra fee, including advertising-free podcasts and the ability to buy discounted tickets early for Slate events. The company does not break out separate financial data on Slate.</p>\n<p>Jacob Weisberg, editor-in-chief of Slate Group, says, “We have had years in which we made a profit and others not.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Although Slate is generally perceived of as having a liberal orientation, Slate.com editor Julia Turner says she is uncomfortable with that characterization. She argues that Slate is marked by reported analysis and is “open-minded and challenges the assumptions” on both sides of the political spectrum. Its own writers, however, have described the publication as liberal. For example, senior technology writer Will Oremus characterized the publication as “left-leaning” in a July piece about Facebook’s changes to its news feed.</p>\n<p>In a 2014 piece, \"Slate Isn’t Too Liberal. But…\" staff responded to readers’ thoughts on a possible bias. National correspondent Will Saletan wrote, \"I wonder whether we need more conservatives writing with equally visible assumptions,\" while then-senior editor Rachael Larimore wrote, \"I would like to see us publish more articles from conservatives with visible viewpoints.\"</p>\n<p>The site is eclectic and often contrarian, at times distinctly challenging liberal assumptions, with commentary and analysis dominating its offerings. Slate mixes the serious with the droll. For example, an assessment of President Trump pulling out of the nuclear arms deal with Iran topped the site after Trump’s announcement, but was placed next to its “Dear Prudence” advice column that declared,  “Help! It’s Annoying When My Hypersensitive LGBTQ Friends Make Fun of My ‘Vanilla’ Sex Life.” The contrarian thrust is found in stories such as, “Let Ben Carson Keep His Table,” a defense of controversial plans to refurbish the office dining room of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson.</p>\n<p>Similarly, it has underscored how liberals, not just conservatives, are taken in by false news. For example, it chided Bernie Sanders for suggesting the Democratic presidential primary vote had been \"rigged\" for eventual nominee Hillary Clinton. And it asked, “Could Scott Pruitt Have a Point?\" in a partial defense of the now departed Environmental Protection Agency chief who was disdained by most liberals but had called for more transparency in EPA use of research findings.</p>\n<p>The Slate Group experiments with new forms of storytelling, such as “The Year in Push Alerts,” a month-by-month look at New York Times’s breaking news notifications, with the alerts scrolling across the screen and related material easily clicked. Slate.com moved aggressively into podcasts and those are now  “a focus more or equal to written content,” says Turner, the editor in chief. That includes producing Malcolm Gladwell’s “Revisionist History,” which focuses on little known or arguably misunderstood but important (even fun) history. Episodes have focused on unsung heroes of the civil rights movement, whether McDonald’s erred when it changed its french fries recipe in an effort to make it healthier, and how some scientists were victims of erroneous fraud allegations about their research. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>While Slate has carved a niche as a generally left-leaning site, its stalwarts have included the late Christopher Hitchens, a renowned contrarian who argued for the Iraq War and against the existence of God. In 2016 it won the George Polk Award for local reporting as a result of “Sixteen Shots,” Chicago freelancer-activist Jamie Kalven’s investigation of the autopsy results resulting from the fatal Chicago police shooting of teenager Laquan McDonald.</p>\n<p>In 2013, legal affairs reporter Dahlia Lithwick won the National Magazine Award for columns and commentary while working at Slate, the first time an online-only publication was given this recognition. In 2011, it won the National Magazine Award for general excellence in the digital media category.</p>\n<p>Its headlines are in sync with content, and it publishes corrections in a “Slate’s Mistakes of the Week” section.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Slate offers biographies and often provides contact information of reporters. Users can submit comments on articles by clicking on a prompt. The site has also devoted space to open debate of its own politics, concluding in a statement on its site that paying members “reiterated the point that integrity—as measured in fidelity to facts and rigorous critical thinking—was far more important than any semblance of ideological ‘balance,’ and indeed that Slate’s generally left-of-center point of view is one of the things that attracts them to the magazine.”</p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguishable from news content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Slate was founded in 1996 as the brainchild of Michael Kinsley, a magazine essayist-editor who had been editor of The New Republic. The New York Times has called him “a pioneering figure in Web publishing.” It was funded by Microsoft and originally based in Seattle (it’s now headquartered in New York City). Kinsley envisioned a publication that would be downloaded and printed out by readers once a week. </p>\n<p>In a NewsGuard email exchange, Kinsley wrote, “My goal at Slate was to make money, in short, believe it or not. (And to have a geographic and intellectual adventure.) I felt very strongly that a press dependent on the whims of some rich guy was not really free and the key to freedom and independence was being self-supporting. And the rich guys I have worked for probably agreed. So far, the web has not proven to be cheaper to produce and distribute than print.”</p>\n<p>Kinsley left Slate in 2002 and, in 2004, Microsoft sold Slate to The Washington Post Company. In 2013, the Washington Post Company was renamed Graham Holdings Company by Donald Graham, the Post chief executive and shareholder, after selling the Washington Post newspaper to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. </p>\n<p><em>Corrections: An earlier version of this label misstated the date that a piece titled “Slate Isn’t Too Liberal, But …” was published. It was originally published in 2014. An earlier version also misspelled the first name of a former senior editor at Slate, Rachael Larimore, and misstated the name of the Environmental Protection Agency.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nJim Warren\n\nEdited by:\nAmy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;John Gregory&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/22/business/media/washington-post-company-buys-slate-magazine.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/22/business/media/washington-post-company-buys-slate-magazine.html</a></li>\n<li>Kinsley</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/12/business/founding-editor-of-slate-online-pioneer-quits.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/12/business/founding-editor-of-slate-online-pioneer-quits.html</a></li>\n<li>Ben Carson dining room</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://slate.com/business/2018/03/the-case-for-letting-ben-carson-keep-his-usd31-000-dining-set.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://slate.com/business/2018/03/the-case-for-letting-ben-carson-keep-his-usd31-000-dining-set.html</a></li>\n<li>Year in push alerts</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/11/the_year_in_push_alerts_how_breaking_news_became_our_lives.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.slate.com/articles/news<em>and</em>politics/politics/2017/11/the<em>year</em>in<em>push</em>alerts<em>how</em>breaking<em>news</em>became<em>our</em>lives.html</a></li>\n<li>“Revisionist History”</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gladwell/status/1004726948784951297?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/gladwell/status/1004726948784951297?lang=en</a></li>\n<li>Slate, Facebook and Fox News</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2018/07/facebooks-plan-to-give-a-ton-of-airtime-to-fox-news-isnt-as-bad-as-it-sounds.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://slate.com/technology/2018/07/facebooks-plan-to-give-a-ton-of-airtime-to-fox-news-isnt-as-bad-as-it-sounds.html</a></li>\n<li>Liberals and fake news</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/11/29/conservatives_aren_t_the_only_ones_who_believe_fake_news.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.slate.com/blogs/the<em>slatest/2016/11/29/conservatives</em>aren<em>t</em>the<em>only</em>ones<em>who</em>believe<em>fake</em>news.html</a></li>\n<li>Defense of Scott Pruitt</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/does-the-epas-call-for-transparency-in-science-make-any-sense.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/does-the-epas-call-for-transparency-in-science-make-any-sense.html</a></li>\n<li>Staff members on possible liberal bias</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/slate_plus/slate_fare/2014/09/is_slate_magazine_too_liberal_or_conservative_what_members_said_about_the.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.slate.com/articles/slate<em>plus/slate</em>fare/2014/09/is<em>slate</em>magazine<em>too</em>liberal<em>or</em>conservative<em>what</em>members<em>said</em>about_the.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"slate.com","author":"Jim Warren","date":"2018-10-09T17:16:32.970+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/slate.com/"}}
