Tribune owns newspapers and publications in major markets, including The Baltimore Sun, New York Daily News, Orlando Sentinel, and its flagship publication, the Chicago Tribune.</p>\n<p>Tribune generates its revenue through advertising and subscriptions for its printed and digital products. Its publications have won numerous awards, including a Pulitzer Prize in 2017.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The website publishes local, state, national, and international news. Mcall.com does original local reporting and has a correspondent based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the state capital, and one in Washington.</p>\n<p>Sections on the site include News, Communities, Capitol Ideas, Sports, Entertainment, Reviews, Business, and Obituaries. A Special Reports section offers a variety of more in-depth articles, photo essays, and interactive features. A feature headlined “Acres of Tax Breaks,” for example, includes a tax bill calculator function.</p>\n<p>The site relies on The Associated Press and other news agencies for national and international news. It also offers a reporter-hosted podcast, Valley View, that addresses top stories in the Lehigh Valley and explores the impact of broader trends on the community. A tab on the website converts the site to an e-newspaper format -- a digital version of The Morning Call that looks like the print version, with arrows to turn the pages.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Stories are well-sourced and credited to writers, with headlines and images accurately reflecting their content. Photographs are credited to staff or photo services. Opinion pages are clearly identified, with a mix of editorials, local op-ed columns, and national columnists.</p>\n<p>Corrections are posted with stories, marked as  For the Record.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Mcall.com provides extensive information about its ownership, and posts a staff directory provides names and email addresses for editors and reporters. Bylines link to reporters’ biographical information. Advertisements are clearly identified.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The website was launched in 1996, more than a century after the first edition of The Morning Call -- then named The Critic -- was founded in 1883 by Samuel S. Woolever. The paper later changed hands and was renamed The Morning Call in 1895. That same year, David A. Miller, who was a reporter at the paper, and his brother Samuel Miller started buying shares in the newspaper. The Millers became the The Morning Call’s sole owners in 1904, and the family owned or worked for the paper for most of the next 80 years. It was sold to The Times Mirror Publishing Company in 1984 and to Tribune Publishing in 2000.</p>\n<p>The site’s About Us page describes The Morning Call as the third-largest newspaper in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nPam Weber-Leaf\n\nEdited by:\nPeggy Ackermann&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://investor.tronc.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=254385&p=irol-newsArticle&id=2174078\" target=\"_blank\">http://investor.tronc.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=254385&#x26;p=irol-newsArticle&#x26;id=2174078</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://investor.tronc.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=254385&p=irol-irhome\" target=\"_blank\">http://investor.tronc.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=254385&#x26;p=irol-irhome</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2017\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2017</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mcall.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mcall.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mcall.com/business/healthcare/mc-biz-stlukes-change-vendor-20180514-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mcall.com/business/healthcare/mc-biz-stlukes-change-vendor-20180514-story.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-nws-walmart-lower-macungie-shooting-justified-20180509-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-nws-walmart-lower-macungie-shooting-justified-20180509-story.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mcall.com/about/mc-contact-list-htmlstory.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mcall.com/about/mc-contact-list-htmlstory.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mcall.com/about/mc-morning-call-history-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mcall.com/about/mc-morning-call-history-story.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mcall.com/about/mc-about-morning-call-storygallery.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mcall.com/about/mc-about-morning-call-storygallery.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"mcall.com","author":"Pam Weber-Leaf","date":"2018-10-11T20:12:15.703+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/mcall.com/"}}
