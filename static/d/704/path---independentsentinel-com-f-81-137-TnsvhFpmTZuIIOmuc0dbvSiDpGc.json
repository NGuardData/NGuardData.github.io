Noble has written on the site that “independent blogs like this one provide an opportunity for common folk to battle the corrupted mainstream media in a search for truth.” According to her biography, Noble worked in education for 33 years. The site does not disclose ownership or financing. It runs advertising.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The Sentinel publishes strongly conservative news, commentary, and analysis for a “Conservative, Libertarian, and Republican audience,” according to a mission statement on the homepage. The site primarily covers U.S. politics, but also reports on international affairs, history, and entertainment. The site functions as a blog: it publishes roughly a dozen stories a day, almost all by a single author, and does no original reporting.</p>\n<p>Political stories generally laud President Donald Trump or other leading Republicans, while lambasting Democrats. Typical headlines have included “Sen. Grassley Unleashed! He Pummels Schumer, Democrats -- Fabulous!” and “Obama Was a Drunk Thug When He Was Young.” International coverage includes stories criticizing London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who is a member of the liberal Labour Party, and Pope Francis.</p>\n<p>The Lifestyle section features stories critical of liberal social causes such as transgender rights and former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s national anthem protest. A This Week in History section lists important events in American history.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Noble does not do original reporting but comments on stories and videos from established media such as CNN, Fox News, and Slate. She also sources information from Twitter and conservative sources such as Breitbart and The Gateway Pundit.</p>\n<p>The Sentinel has published a hoax. The 2018 story, “Pedophile Shot Dead by Mom As He Tried to Rape Her Child,” was based on a fabricated story from ABC News 14, a sham site masquerading as a local ABC affiliate. But the affiliate did not exist, and the site made no mention of where such a station was located. The story mentioned a mother, a girl, an attacker, an investigator, and a member of a victims’ rights group, but provided no names.  As of October 9, 2018, or a week after publication, the pedophile story had not been removed. NewsGuard did not find other examples of patently fake content.</p>\n<p>The Sentinel claims to “report the news the media won’t” and to provide “news, opinion and commentary, analysis, factual and original content.” While the site is transparent about its conservative mission, it fails to distinguish between news and opinion: Stories, labeled as “the latest news,” regularly include strongly opinionated language while exaggerating or distorting facts.</p>\n<p>A news story about Nancy Pelosi described Democrats as “the party of porn stars and profligate spenders of other peoples’ money,” and stated that “of the 47% who don’t pay federal taxes, the majority are her [Pelosi’s] base.” Noble seemed to be referencing an oft-cited statistic, repeated by Mitt Romney during his 2012 presidential campaign against President Obama, that 47 percent of households do not pay federal income taxes. Noble misstated the statistic. Many people too poor to pay federal income tax still pay federal payroll taxes. Only 14.4 percent of people don’t pay any federal taxes, according to the Tax Policy Center. That group is mostly senior citizens, who are increasingly more likely to vote Republican, according to Gallup polling.</p>\n<p>A news story about Chelsea Clinton promoting her children’s book declared that “Hillary Clinton is a Marxist Alinskyite. She raised her daughter in the same vein and they are preparing her to one day be president. The Clintons have corrupted the Democrat Party, moving it very far left.” Hillary Clinton is not a Marxist. President Clinton was widely viewed as a centrist who challenged liberal Democratic orthodoxy on issues such as free-trade and welfare. During her two presidential campaigns, Hillary Clinton was often criticized by liberals as being too moderate.</p>\n<p>A news story about the victory of Boston city councilor Ayanna Pressley in a 2018 Democratic primary for Congress declared, “Another Communist/Socialist Wins a Primary in Massachusetts as a Dem.” Pressley has never identified as a communist or socialist, although she did receive an endorsement from democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Before serving on the Boston City Council, Pressley was a staffer for Rep. Joe Kennedy II and later worked as a senior aide to then-Sen. John Kerry. </p>\n<p>Another news story, “John McCain Planned the Trash Trump &#x26; Conservatives Funeral for a Year,” stated that “anyone who fails to pay sufficient homage to McCain now is lambasted and ends up on a list.” Noble did not provide evidence of “a list,” only linking to a Daily Beast story criticizing President Trump and conservatives.</p>\n<p>The news story, “Leftist Dems in Colorado Just Proposed Another Way to Corrupt the Vote,” stated that “manipulating and indoctrinating is the bailiwick of the Democrats.” The story discussed a proposal to lower the minimum voting age in Colorado, but did not make clear how Democrats were directly involved with corrupting any vote. The initiative did not qualify to be on the ballot for the Nov. 6, 2018 election.</p>\n<p>The Sentinel states that it “welcomes” corrections, but NewsGuard could not find examples. The Sentinel did not respond to NewsGuard’s two emails seeking comment about its corrections policy and editorial practices, including its use of headlines, sourcing, and distortion of facts.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The Sentinel names its writers, although Noble writes nearly all of the content. According to the Authors page, other contributors include Derek Maltz, former Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Special Operations Division from 2005 to 2014. Because the site does not reveal Noble’s actual identity, NewsGuard has determined that it does not reveal ownership, or who is in charge.</p>\n<p>Noble did not respond to NewsGuard’s two emails seeking comment about how readers can learn more about who owns the website and how it is financed.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The website was created in 2011. To explain her pseudonym, Noble wrote on the site that “many of my family members are liberals and don’t want their last name out there on a center-right blog.”</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan
