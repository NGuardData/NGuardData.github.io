The center reported raising nearly $9.9 million in its 2017 IRS filing, with $8 million coming from foundations including the Knight Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, and Ford Foundation.</p>\n<p>The site does not run advertisements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The organization’s stated mission is “to serve democracy by revealing abuses of power, corruption and betrayal of public trust by powerful public and private institutions, using the tools of investigative journalism.”</p>\n<p>Center for Public Integrity offers in-depth coverage of social and political issues, often reported in conjunction with other outlets, including The Atlantic, FiveThirtyEight, and NPR. Stories in the Politics section often cover campaign finance and federal programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. The National Security section includes stories about nuclear arms and other topics related to defense. Other sections include Immigration, Business, and Workers Rights.</p>\n<p>The site published a feature called “Local Voters, Distant Donors,” a multi-part series published ahead of the November 2018 midterm elections that tracks the role of out-of-state money and cryptocurrency in campaigns. Other typical stories have carried headlines such as “Women will hold record numbers of elected offices in 2019. See where they made the biggest gains,” and “Surge of oil and gas flowing to Texas coastline triggers building boon, tensions.”</p>\n<p>The center’s collaborative reporting projects include “Abandoned in America,” a six-part series published in 2018 with Public Radio International and other public radio stations across the country, documenting six communities grappling with poverty. Another 2018 multimedia story, published with NPR, reported how big pharmaceutical companies influence the cost of Medicaid drugs.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Stories typically provide original reporting, including firsthand interviews, data and information obtained from government agencies, and experts in their subject matters.  Headlines accurately reflect content. </p>\n<p>The center’s many awards include a 2017 Pulitzer Prize in explanatory reporting for the Panama Papers, an investigation sparked by a leak of 11.5 million financial and corporate documents that revealed how world leaders were laundering money offshore and evading taxes. The Panama Papers was a project of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and involved over 100 news organizations from around the world. The report was also awarded a George Polk Award and honored by the Investigative Reporters and Editors. As a result of the project, governments have recovered over $700 million in fines and back taxes, the consortium asserted. </p>\n<p>Center for Public Integrity also received a Pulitzer in 2014 in the investigative reporting category for “Breathless and Burdened,” a yearlong investigation examining how doctors and lawyers allegedly rigged a system to deny benefits to miners with black lung disease.</p>\n<p>The center describes itself as a nonpartisan investigative newsroom that does not engage in advocacy. However, that claim stems in part from the organization’s reports on Charles and David Koch, billionaire brothers who have funded many Republican and conservative causes. In August 2011, Politico.com questioned whether Center for Public Integrity had improperly coordinated efforts with Greenpeace, an activist environmentalist group, after both organizations published the same information about the Koch brothers on the same day, relating to Koch Industries’ lobbying efforts against health and safety regulations. A Center for Public Integrity spokesman told Politico that the organization was doing research on the story when it became aware that Greenpeace was also working on it. The two organizations then agreed on an arrangement in which CPI would publish its work first. “There was no combined reporting on it,” the spokesman, Randy Barrett, told Politico.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard has found that the Center for Public Integrity has published in-depth examinations of subjects on all sides of the political spectrum. It has investigated conservative power brokers as well as Democratic campaigns that have relied on “dark money,” a term used to describe political donations whose source is not known. A story published ahead of the 2016 presidential election, for example, reported on how Hillary Clinton benefited from secretive political donations. </p>\n<p>The organization states on the site that it subscribes to the Code of Ethics of the Society of Professional Journalists. The code includes policies for identifying sources, correcting errors, and other journalistic practices.</p>\n<p>On a separate page, the site articulates its corrections policy, which states that corrections will appear both in the story and on the corrections page. Corrections are noted at the top of stories in italics, with a link to a more detailed explanation on the corrections page.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The center names the authors of its stories and provides their biographies, email addresses, and social media handles. Another page provides a complete list of editorial staff, including senior staff.</p>\n<p>The site also provides information about the Center for Public Integrity’s board of directors, as well as tax returns dating back to 2002. The Our Funders section provides an extensive list of donors to the center, from individuals to foundations such as the bipartisan Democracy Fund, Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, and Laura and John Arnold Foundation. </p>\n<p>The site does not run advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Center for Public Integrity was founded in 1989 by Charles Lewis, a former investigative reporter for ABC News and producer of the CBS News program “60 Minutes.” Lewis created the  International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in 1997 and served as the organization’s executive director until 2005.
