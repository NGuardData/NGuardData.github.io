Visitors to the site can read a limited number of articles for free, or purchase a subscription for unlimited digital access. The Courier-Journal sells advertisements through what it calls its “multi-media advertising and marketing solutions company.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>In addition to local and regional news, Courier-journal.com offers extensive coverage of sports, especially of the local college football and basketball teams. In the spring, the site has a section entirely dedicated to coverage of the Kentucky Derby.  </p>\n<p>In late 2015, Gannett launched the USA Today Network and, beginning with courier-journal.com<em>,</em> standardized the websites of its 100+ local news outlets to combine them with its national publication, USA Today. Gannett also consolidated the national news operations of its media properties, cutting the Courier Journal’s<em> </em>Washington, D.C., The newspaper and website now rely on the USA Today Network for national coverage.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The newsroom staff, according to the site, adheres to five “ethical pillars” promoted across the USA Today Network and described on a page on Courier-journal.com: “Seeking and reporting the truth,” “serving the public interest,” “exercising fair play,” “maintaining independence,” and “acting with integrity.” </p>\n<p>The site appends clearly marked corrections to the tops of articles, noting how the original error has been corrected.</p>\n<p>As with many traditional news organizations, the Courier Journal separates its newsgathering operation from its editorial and opinion pages. While serving a state and region that has been reliably Republican in recent years, the Courier Journal has endorsed  the Democratic candidate in each of  the past 10 national presidential elections.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The website lists newsroom leaders and staff members with their phone numbers on an easy-to-find page. All company departments can be contacted through a Contact Us form. Through its USAToday Network branding, the site clearly displays its ownership by Gannett.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Courier-Journal<em> </em>was founded in 1868 through a merger of the Louisville Courier<em> </em>and the Louisville Journal, making it Kentucky’s largest newspaper. For most of the 20th century, the paper was owned by the Bingham family, and was a regional institution known for publishing hard hitting-investigations of local government and industry, and for promoting civil rights in the segregated South. </p>\n<p>In 1925, the paper founded what would become the popular Scripps National Spelling Bee competition. In 1972, a reporter from the Courier Journal,<em> </em>Paul Branzburg, became the named appellant in a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case after he refused to reveal the identities of sources in stories he wrote about drug use in Kentucky. In Branzburg v. Hayes, which merged similar cases involving reporters at The New York Times and WTEV-TV in New Bedford, Mass., the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that journalists had no First Amendment protection against grand jury subpoenas. The paper has won 10 Pulitzer Prizes.  </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nYemile Bucay\n\nEdited by:\nJoyce Purnick&#x26;emsp;Eric Effron&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/13/us/sale-by-binghams-marks-end-of-era-in-kentucky-journalism.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/13/us/sale-by-binghams-marks-end-of-era-in-kentucky-journalism.html </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2005\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2005 </a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://spellingbee.com/90-years-national-spelling-bee\" target=\"_blank\">http://spellingbee.com/90-years-national-spelling-bee </a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/408/665\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/408/665 </a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://noahveltman.com/endorsements/\" target=\"_blank\">https://noahveltman.com/endorsements/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/20/us/gannett-gets-louisville-papers-for-300-million.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/20/us/gannett-gets-louisville-papers-for-300-million.html </a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.gannett.com/brands/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.gannett.com/brands/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/12/03/gannett-introduces-usa-today-network-uniting-local-national-properties/76716562/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/12/03/gannett-introduces-usa-today-network-uniting-local-national-properties/76716562/ </a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/05/louisville-courier-journal-closes-dc-bureau-207317\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/05/louisville-courier-journal-closes-dc-bureau-207317 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://static.courier-journal.com/about/&nbsp;\" target=\"_blank\">http://static.courier-journal.com/about/  </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/contact/staff/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.courier-journal.com/contact/staff/ </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branzburg_v._Hayes\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branzburg<em>v.</em>Hayes</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"courier-journal.com","author":"Yemile Bucay","date":"2018-07-30T15:25:02.657+0000"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/courier-journal.com/"}}
