It covers global news, as well as news from seven counties close to the Bay Area. Given its proximity to Silicon Valley, the publication declares that it is dedicated to “the impact of technology and the changing demographic landscape of America.”</p>\n<p>The site also features The Cannifornian, a blog covering news and information about cannabis and its usage in California. </p>\n<p>Users must sign up for a paid subscription to use the website after viewing a select number of articles per month.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>The Mercury News updates and corrects errors, which are detailed on the website’s separate Corrections and Clarifications page. The publication responds to criticism and acknowledges reporting mistakes. </p>\n<p>Mercury News staff writers have won two Pulitzer Prizes, most recently in 1990 for coverage of the Bay Area earthquake and its aftermath. The publication has been named a Pulitzer finalist several times.</p>\n<p>The website’s Opinion page publishes daily editorials, which are clearly distinguished from news articles.The editorial board publishes an Election Recommendation page endorsing candidates running in Bay Area and California elections. In October 2016, the editorial board endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president, calling Republican Donald Trump “utterly unqualified.” It endorsed Barack Obama as the Democratic presidential nominee over Clinton in January 2008.</p>\n<p>In 1996, The Mercury News published “Dark Alliance,” a three-part series alleging that an anti-government, CIA-backed group in Nicaragua smuggled cocaine into America to fund attempts to overthrow the Nicaraguan government. </p>\n<p>The series triggered investigations into the CIA. However, other news organizations including The New York Times and the Washington Post, accused the series’ author, Gary Webb, of  exaggerating key aspects of the account, notably the premise that the CIA was responsible for the crack cocaine epidemic in America. </p>\n<p>The Mercury News transferred Webb from an office in California’s state capital, Sacramento, to a less prominent location after internally reviewing the series. Webb resigned the following year.</p>\n<p>The newspaper later said in an editorial that it “should have done better in presenting gray areas” of Webb’s piece, and “created impressions that were open to interpretation.” In 2013, it published a follow-up editorial saying Webb’s story “marked an institutional failure by a newspaper eager for its own prizes and stature.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Mercurynews.com has an in-depth Contact Us page, which lists contact information for all editorial staff and managers. Articles are published with the author’s contact information and a linked biographical page.</p>\n<p>The website also publishes the Bay Area News Group Ethics Policy, detailing reporting standards to ensure accuracy and fairness, such as contacting subjects of criticism in stories for comment, and policies on the use of anonymous sources.</p>\n<p>Mercurynews.com participates in the Trust Project (thetrustproject.org), in which news organizations commit to follow specific guidelines related to transparency.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Mercury News was first published in June 1851 as the<em> </em>San Jose Weekly Visitor<em>.</em> It is one of the oldest continuously published daily newspapers in California. The paper flourished during the technology boom of the 1990s, reporting on budding Silicon Valley businesses. </p>\n<p>In the 1990s, The Mercury News<em> </em>maintained a newsroom staff of 440. In January 2018, the paper had 39 union staff members, as well as additional non-union staffers. </p>\n<p>The Mercury News<em> </em>was a prominent brand for the Knight-Ridder newspaper chain for more than 50 years, before coming under the ownership of Digital First, a company financed by private equity funds that has been criticized for cutting resources devoted to the quality of its newspaper properties.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nKat Harling\n\nEdited by:\nAnna-Sophie Harling&#x26;emsp;Amy Westfeldt&#x26;emsp;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a
