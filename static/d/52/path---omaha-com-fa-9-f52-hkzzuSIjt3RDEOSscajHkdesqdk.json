The company’s media division, BH Media Group, runs the newspaper and website. The company announced in February 2018 that it would reduce staff at several of its publications, and The World-Herald cut 43 jobs and reduced the number of pages in its newspaper. </p>\n<p>The site derives revenue from advertising and a paywall for subscribers.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Omaha.com covers news, politics, and business in Nebraska and parts of Iowa. Regional coverage includes such topics as trends in school enrollment and local crime. The site extensively covers college sports, including the Nebraska Cornhuskers football team and the Creighton Bluejays.</p>\n<p>The entertainment section includes reviews of local bars and restaurants, and provides information about upcoming concerts in Nebraska’s major cities. News providers including The Associated Press and The Washington Post provide coverage of national and international news.</p>\n<p>The website’s opinion section features editorials and original cartoons about current events. Readers can contribute photographs or story ideas to Good News, which features positive stories in local communities. Omaha.com also publishes community content, including wedding announcements and obituaries. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Articles are generally based on first-hand reporting and are balanced and well-sourced. Headlines are factual and accurately reflect the information in stories. The website clearly distinguishes between news and opinion sections.</p>\n<p>In a Who We Are section, Omaha.com outlines its commitment to fact-based journalism and to the community. It notes that Goodfellows, the publication’s charity since 1910, provides emergency assistance, grocery vouchers, and clothing for people in need.</p>\n<p>The site does not provide a visible corrections policy, but it regularly correct errors, appending a note at the bottom of articles explaining what was corrected.  </p>\n<p>Omaha.com runs a weekly column, Warren Watch, about Omaha-based Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffet, and regularly discloses that Berkshire Hathaway owns the World-Herald. (Warren Watch was started in 2008 before Buffet bought the outlet.) According to a July 2018 article on the site, “the project was based partly on the premise that some people will read almost anything written about the Oracle of Omaha, who was, arguably, our most famous citizen.” </p>\n<p>“When Berkshire acquired The World-Herald in 2011,” the article said, “some media-watchers called and wondered: What will happen to the column and the paper’s coverage of your new owner? The answer: No change, and that’s what’s happened so far.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Omaha.com names its authors and provides biographical information about them. The website also features an extensive directory of its editors and senior staff, whom readers may contact by email or phone. Ownership by Berkshire Hathaway is disclosed. Advertisements are clearly labeled. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The newspaper was founded in 1885. Between 1920 and 1944, The Omaha World-Herald won three Pulitzer Prizes but has not won any since. The website domain was registered in 1996.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited
