Scientific American and its website are run by Springer Nature, an academic publishing company backed by BC Partners, a private equity firm.</p>\n<p>The site runs advertising and sponsored content, and sells print and digital subscriptions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Scientificamerican.com publishes articles and reports detailing news, innovation, and information about science, technology, health, psychology, the environment, sustainability, and history. It also has an Education section, which offers interactive information and activities for families, children, and teenagers interested in the sciences and related fields. Unlimited access to the website’s content requires a paid subscription.    </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Scientificamerican.com relies on sources such as peer reviewed articles, reports, and case studies. Cited sources are linked directly in articles, which are written in unbiased, objective language.</p>\n<p>The site publishes pieces written by its editorial board, which are credited to “The Editors”  and are often political in nature, written from a generally left-leaning perspective. Editorial headlines include “End the War on Weed,” “It’s Time to End the War On Women’s Health “ (September 2017), and “No One Should Have Sole Authority to Launch a Nuclear Attack” (August 2017). </p>\n<p>An editorial published in the September 1, 2016, issue of the magazine titled “Donald Trump’s Lack of Respect for Science is Alarming” criticized Trump, the Republican presidential candidate at the time, for his stance on climate change and environmental policies.  The article also asserted that Scientific American <em> </em>“is not in the business of endorsing political candidates,” and said the publication was committed to producing content that was unbiased and evidence-based, so that readers could make their own decisions.</p>\n<p>The publication has since published articles discussing the actions and statements made by President Trump and his administration about environmental protection, sustainable energy, the EPA, and climate change.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>On its Press Room page, the website provides biographical information about its editorial staff, as well as for the magazine’s board of advisors.

Sponsored content is clearly marked.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Inventor Rufus M.
