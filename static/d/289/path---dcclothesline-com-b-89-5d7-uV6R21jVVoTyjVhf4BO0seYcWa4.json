The site is connected to DC Dirty Laundry, another conservative commentary site, according to the DC Dirty Laundry’s About page. The two sites publish a lot of the same content and share many of the same writers. DC Clothesline appears to be financed by advertising.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>DC Clothesline publishes content that often criticizes Democrats and liberal causes. Typical stories have run under headlines including, “New York City Mayor Confirms What We Already Knew: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is an Idiot” and “Lock Her Up: Nancy Pelosi Earned Fortune on IPO Stock Through ‘Illegal’ Insider Trading.” Most of the content appears to be re-published from other sites, usually with some form of credit.</p>\n<p>The site divides content into sections that include Deplorables Network, Articles, News, Politics, Guns/2A, Videos, Culture, Christianity, and Store, which links to Keepandbear.com, a site that sells merchandise described as “conservative gifts and apparel.”</p>\n<p>DC Clothesline’s does not describe its mission, but its sister site, DC Dirty Laundry, states on its About page: “The truth can not die and the mainstream liberal media can not be allowed to write history according to their own flawed perception. WE BELIEVE IN GOD, FAMILY AND COUNTRY. IN THAT ORDER.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>DC Clothesline has repeatedly published false stories. For example, in January 2019, the site published a story headlined, “New York’s Gruesome, ‘To Term” Abortion Bill Will Now Allow Actual Baby Parts To Be Sold On Black Market.’” The story, which was re-published from a site called Freedom Outpost, claims that New York state’s Reproductive Health Act “has absolutely nothing to do with women’s rights, or their right to literally kill their babies, but everything to do with the black market sales of fetal and baby parts.” The article goes on to claim that adding these “baby parts” to the black market is the motivation for the “US Socialist Left’s desperate push to keep open borders.”</p>\n<p>The story cites no evidence that “baby parts” resulting from abortions would be sold on a black market. DC Clothesline and Freedom Outpost speculate that Democratic lawmakers support abortion rights laws — and oppose a wall along the southern border — so they can personally benefit from criminal enterprises. However, neither site provides any evidence for this theory or, more specifically, for the theory that “baby parts” are sold on a black market.</p>\n<p>The site has also published more prominent conspiracy theories that have been widely debunked. In February 2019, for example, DC Clothesline re-published a story from the Washington Standard with the headline, “Clinton Body Count Grows: Was Whistleblower ‘Suicided’ Days After Exposing Clinton Associates ‘Sex Slave Farm’?” The article promoted a conspiracy theory that former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have orchestrated the deaths of several people deemed to be a threat to them. This conspiracy, which dates to the early 1990s, disregards credible reports from law enforcement and medical professionals who have ruled that the cause of death for many of the individuals was suicide. </p>\n<p>Most of the content on the site appears to be re-published from other sites, including many that  NewsGuard has found to be unreliable, including The Washington Standard, Natural News, and Conservative Firing Line.</p>\n<p>Because DC Clothesline frequently distorts information and cites unreliable sources, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not gather and present news responsibly.</p>\n<p>DC Clothesline has repeatedly published misleading headlines. For example, in February 2019, the site published a story under the headline, “FAKE SCIENCE: Heat ‘records’ heavily manipulated by dishonest climate change propagandists to try to push global warming lie.” However, it is not true that record temperatures were “manipulated.” Rather, those historically high temperatures were accurately taken by credible scientific organizations, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and indicate a warming planet. NOAA states on its website: “Impacts from climate change are happening now. These impacts extend well beyond an increase in temperature, affecting ecosystems and communities in the United States and around the world.”</p>\n<p>A headline from February 2019, “Death Cult Democrats: Killing newborn babies the day they’re born is ‘good for the economy,’” suggests that Democrats said or promoted the idea that “killing newborn babies they day they’re born is ‘good for the economy.’” The headline appears to refer to comments that Chelsea Clinton made at a reproductive rights event in 2018, arguing that the landmark Roe v Wade Supreme Court decision, which established a woman’s right to an abortion, also allowed more women to pursue careers, instead of staying at home to take care of a family. Clinton did not suggest that “killing newborn babies they day they’re born” would be “good for the economy.” The DC Clothesline story, which was re-published from Naturalnews.com, cites no evidence for the assertion that Clinton or Democrats in general have promoted this view.</p>\n<p>DC Clothesline’s content is unabashedly opinionated, but it does not disclose any agenda or point of view. The site has published multiple stories arguing that people should avoid immunizations, and has often backed that argument with false information.</p>\n<p>In a January 2019 story headlined “Yahoo News story accidentally admits most children infected with measles outbreak were already vaccinated,” the site promoted the theory that the Measle, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is ineffective. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has unequivocally recommended that children get the vaccine to protect against those diseases. Both stories were re-published from Natural News.</p>\n<p>D.C. Clothesline has also published stories that assert a link between vaccines and autism, a claim that has been widely debunked. In December 2018 and June 2018, respectively, the site published stories under the headlines, “The CDC has lied about vaccines and autism for 14 years… Weston A Price Foundation sounds the alarm” and “New study proves the UNDENIABLE connection between vaccination and autism.” The stories claim that vaccines have “an undeniable connection” or a “strong association” with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The CDC has repeatedly stated that vaccines do not cause autism, and that no link between vaccines and autism has been established. </p>\n<p>Because DC Clothesline has repeatedly published distorted and false information to advance a point of view, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard could not find any corrections on the site.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard contacted site owner Dean Garrison by email to seek comment on DC Clothesline’s editorial practices — including its sourcing practices, how it handles the difference between news and opinion, its approach to corrections, and its headlines. Garrison declined to comment.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>DCClothesline.com does not provide contact information or biographies for its content creators or site leaders. It does not identify its owners. </p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<p>NewsGuard contacted Garrison by email seeking comment on DC Clothesline’s lack of disclosure about who owns, runs, and writes for the site. He confirmed in an email that he owns the site, but otherwise declined to comment.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>DC Clothesline’s domain was created in 2013, according to ICANN WHOIS and Domain Big Data, two domain search engines.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nKate Harloe\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a
