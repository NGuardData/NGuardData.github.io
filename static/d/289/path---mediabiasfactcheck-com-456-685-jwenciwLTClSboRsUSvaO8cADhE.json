The site is financed by advertising and individual donors. According to Van Zandt, everyone other than himself who writes for the site works on a volunteer basis.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>On its About page, the website, which refers to itself as MBFC News, states that its mission is to educate the public “on media bias and deceptive news practices.” According to the site, “MBFC News’ aim is to inspire action and a rejection of overtly biased media. We want to return to an era of straight forward news reporting.”</p>\n<p>Media Bias/Fact Check publishes short analyses of the political orientation, or biases, of media outlets that are submitted for review by readers. Sites are assigned one of seven ratings: Extreme Left, Left, Left-Center, Least Biased, Right-Center, Right, and Extreme Right. The ratings are displayed visually, with a dot on an arrow, meant to illustrate the site’s place on the political spectrum. The write-ups usually include a rating for the degree to which an outlet relies on factual reporting, and the reviews of major news and information sources often include some information on the outlet’s history and ownership, followed by a section that explains the writer’s reasoning for the rating.</p>\n<p>The evaluations typically include a poll at the bottom of the post, allowing readers to rate the site themselves and to see how others rated it.</p>\n<p>Media Bias/Fact Check says that it aims for balance in selecting what sites to review, although more conservative sites than liberal sites have been rated. In its FAQ section, the site writes: \"The first 500 or so sources reviewed were picked by the reviewers and were mostly balanced. The last 2000+ sources added have been submitted by users. We have found that right wing sites are submitted for review more. Significantly more! We review what we get. We would love to have more left wing sites submitted for review to provide more balance.”</p>\n<p>Other major fact-checking sites, such as Factcheck.org or Snopes.com, typically fact-check specific quotes, claims, or articles. Media Bias/Fact Check, in contrast, focuses on the sites. The homepage allows readers to access ratings in a variety of ways. The Filtered Search, for example, enables readers to search for ratings by political orientation or by the name of the site. The Pro-Science category contains ratings for sources that, according to the site, “consist of legitimate science or are evidence based through the use of credible scientific sourcing.” Another section, Conspiracy-Pseudoscience, lists publications that, in the site’s estimation, “may publish unverifiable information that is not always supported by evidence.”</p>\n<p>The site also publishes content credited to other fact-checking and news outlets.</p>\n<p>The write-ups are generally one to five paragraphs in length, and rely heavily on the judgment of the individual writer. Writers sometimes link to stories or sources to support their claims, but they often do not provide extensive evidence or explain in detail the research behind their assessment.</p>\n<p>For example, in the review of ProPublica, which Media Bias/Fact Check rates as “Left-Center,” the writer notes that “while ProPublica purports to be non-partisan, a review of their recent reports are aimed at right leaning politicians and their issues.” The writer does not go into detail to explain how she reached that conclusion, although she does link to two ProPublica articles.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Media Bias/Fact Check publishes a detailed methodology page that explains the site’s approach to rating publications. The description begins with the disclaimer that “when determining bias, there isn’t any true formula that is 100% objective. There are objective measures that can be calculated, but ultimately there will be some degree of subjective judgement to determine these.”</p>\n<p>The method that writers use to arrive at a rating involves a point system assessing four factors: Biased Wording, Factual/Sourcing, Story Choices, and Political Affiliation. The site defines Political Affiliation as follows: “How strongly does the source endorse a particular political ideology? In other words how extreme are their views. (This can be rather subjective.)” The writer rates the site in each category on a scale that ranges from 0, indicating no bias, to 10, which indicates “maximum” bias.</p>\n<p>The description on the methodology page compares the site’s reviews to those that appear on movie sites such as IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. Van Zandt, in a phone interview, expanded on the comparison. “It’s a criticism, it’s an opinion, like a movie review,” he said. “We try to find as much evidence as possible to support that review, just like you would do for a movie review.”</p>\n<p>In the FAQ section, the site answers a question about the credentials of its reviewers, stating that “none of the MBFC team are professional journalists.” The answer continues: “We actually see this as an advantage as we are media consumers just like you. Each person on the team is college educated in a variety of fields with a common interest in keeping media accountable for their words and information.” Van Zandt told NewsGuard that writers for the site “occasionally” call the sites they review for comment, “but tend to rely on outside sources to gather information.”</p>\n<p>The site’s write-ups include the opinion and conclusions of the writer, but they do not typically misstate or distort information. Therefore, NewsGuard has determined that the site gathers and presents information responsibly and that it handles the difference between news and opinion responsibly.</p>\n<p>On its methodology page, the site states that it abides by the International Fact-Checking Network Fact-checkers’ Code of Principles, which include “a commitment to open and honest corrections” and to publishing a corrections policy. The site includes a corrections policy, which expresses the site’s commitment to accuracy and provides an email for readers to contact the site to point out errors. Corrections are published in the form of a note at the bottom of the story describing the error and how it was corrected. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site’s evaluations typically credit the writer at the bottom of the text in parentheses. The site’s About page provides a list of names and titles for the editorial staff, along with short biographies for the writers. The page provides a general email address for readers to contact editorial staff.</p>\n<p>The site’s About page states that “Dave Van Zandt is the primary editor for sources” and that “he is assisted by a collective of volunteers who assist in research for many sources listed on these pages.” The FAQ page states that Van Zandt “makes all final editing and publishing decisions.” It also provides a short biography, which states that Van Zandt received a communications degree “before pursuing a higher degree in the sciences” and that he “currently works full time in the healthcare industry.”</p>\n<p>The site discloses that it is owned “solely” by Van Zandt.</p>\n<p>Advertising is distinguishable from editorial content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>Dave Van Zandt founded
