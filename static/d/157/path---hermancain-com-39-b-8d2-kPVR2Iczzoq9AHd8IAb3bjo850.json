New Voice Inc., based in Stockbridge, Ga. </p>\n<p>The site runs advertising, including ads for America Fighting Back, the super PAC launched in 2018 to support President Donald Trump and his policies. Cain, the former CEO of the National Restaurant Association, is the PAC’s chairman.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>In addition to serving as the home of Cain’s internet radio show, as well as a promotional tool for his books, speaking engagements, and TV appearances, the site also publishes news commentary on politics and current events written by staff writers, and occasionally Cain himself. </p>\n<p>Stories champion Trump, Republicans, conservative values, and Christianity, while criticizing liberals and the mainstream media. For example, on August 30, 2018, the site published a story with the headline “Beautiful: Trump calls Watergate self-legend Carl Bernstein a ‘degenerate fool,’ slams CNN lies.” A September 2018 story ran with the headline “How Trump’s exit from the nuclear deal is already putting the hurt on Iran.” While most of the site’s content is opinion and advocacy, it does run some straight news stories, based on reporting done by other outlets. On September 24, 2018, the site published a story titled “BREAKING: Axios reports Rod Rosenstein has resigned over ‘wear a wire’ story.” </p>\n<p>Other sections on the site include Impeach Impeach Impeach and Trump Derangement Syndrome, which run stories seeking to rebut critics and criticisms of Trump. However, the site’s writers do occasionally criticize Trump. For example, a September 2018 story ran with the headline “After latest rage tweet, Trump needs to either fire Sessions, give him directives to change...or shut up.” </p>\n<p>The site also covers the perceived threat of socialism with stories tagged, Socialism Kills or America’s Socialist Dream Girl, which focus on politicians such as Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Cain has written pieces on socialism that outline what he believes are its philosophical and practical shortcomings. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Credibility</h3>\n<p>Despite the site’s name, Herman Cain writes little content. Most stories are written by Dan Calabrese, a “veteran journalist, copywriter and author,” according to the site, and Robert Laurie, a conservative commentator whose work has appeared in The Detroit News, and on DailyCaller.com and Townhall.com.</p>\n<p>Writers for the site do not conduct original reporting, but provide commentary and analysis of news stories and social media posts. The site regularly sources reports from a variety of established media, such as The National Review, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post.</p>\n<p>Headlines often contain opinionated or attention-grabbing language, but generally reflect the content of stories. Examples include “Single-payer health care could be a death sentence for seniors” and “Desperate to stay relevant, Michael Moore wishes Karl Marx a happy birthday – compares him to Jesus.”</p>\n<p>The site regularly publishes content that looks like news, asking visitors to share videos funded by America Fighting Back PAC. For example, on September 10, 2018, Cain authored a piece that ran with the headline “Want to stand up for Trump and conservatism? Share these four videos today!” Later that month, the site published another piece authored by Cain titled “Fight the left’s lies by sharing these five videos.” All the videos were created by America Fighting Back, which as of September 2018, has been funded almost entirely by donations from conservative activist Floyd Brown, the founder of conservative news website Western Journal, as well as nonprofit advocacy group Citizens United.  </p>\n<p> The site does not distinguish news from opinion content, nor does it clearly state that all content should be viewed as opinion. Because the site often publishes opinionated stories and headlines that are presented as news, NewsGuard has determined that the site does not handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly. Editors at the site did not respond to NewsGuard’s three emails seeking comment on how readers of the site should understand the difference between news and opinion.</p>\n<p>The site does not state its corrections policy, and NewsGuard was not able to find examples of corrections. Editors at the site did not reply to NewsGuard’s three email messages seeking comment about corrections. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>The site names and provides biographical information about authors and other members of Team Cain, which include producers of Cain’s radio show. However, the site does not provide contact information, such as email addresses, for its authors. The site provides a contact portal and a P.O box mailing address for readers who want to contact the site’s staff, but does not provide an email address.</p>\n<p>Ownership of the site is disclosed. Advertising is clearly labeled.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>In 2011, Cain, the former CEO of Godfather’s Pizza, announced a bid for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination and was the frontrunner for a short time. Cain dropped out of the race in late 2011, amid allegations that he had sexually harassed several women in the 1990s while heading the National Restaurant Association, as well as an allegation of an extramarital affair.</p>\n<p>In 2013 Cox Media Group, a subsidiary of Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises, hired Cain to host a syndicated three-hour radio program. Cain stopped hosting the the Cox program in 2018, but he continues to host a 45-minute show on his website. </p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>Written by:\nEvan Haddad\n\nEdited by:\nJosh Keefe&#x26;emsp;Amy
