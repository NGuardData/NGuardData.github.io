<h3>Ownership and Financing</h3>
<p>The New York Times Company is publicly owned with a shareholder structure that places power in the hands of the Sulzberger family, descendants of patriarch Adolph S. Ochs, who moved from Chattanooga, Tennessee, and bought the struggling paper in 1896. Following financial travail in the wake of the 2008 world financial crisis, Carlos Slim Helú, Mexico’s wealthiest individual, loaned the company $250 million and later became its single largest shareholder. The Times also negotiated a $225 million sale and leaseback of its then-new Manhattan headquarters building. With the industry-wide decline in advertising and print circulation revenues, the company increasingly relies on revenue from its more than 2.7 million digital subscribers (and about one million print subscribers and newstand buyers). In addition, the company receives revenue from its NYTLicensing Service, which licenses content to other news organizations and brands; from its NYTLive business, which runs conferences and other events; and from its product recommendation website Wirecutter.</p>
<p>Dean Baquet, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who previously worked as editor of the Los Angeles Times, is executive editor of the paper. A.G. Sulzberger, himself a former reporter, succeeded his father, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., as publisher in 2018 to become the sixth generation of the family to head the paper. Baquet oversees a newsroom of over 1,450 journalists, including national and foreign bureaus.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>The Times offers a comprehensive daily examination of news, politics, culture, science, sports, and other primary areas of human endeavor. While the news organization still produces local coverage of New York, it has declined over the years as the paper has expanded the national and international scale of its reporting and of its readership. In the Sunday edition, The Times publishes a substantial magazine with regular long features, columns, photos, and puzzles. The magazine’s ambitions are typified by its devoting an August 2016 issue to a single 42,000-word article on the Middle East, "Fractured Lands," that included a virtual-reality video on the retaking of the Iraqi city of Fallujah from ISIS by the Iraqi military and a U.S.-led coalition.</p>
<p>In addition to its regular news coverage, The Times has a 100-person staff for editorials and opinion sections. It features special projects through multimedia storytelling and the creation of new sections outside the normal news cycle. “Overlooked,” for example, is a series of obituaries of famous women throughout history who had not received attention from the paper upon their passing. Many of these features are interactive and visual, taking a significant amount of public data or information and making it accessible to readers. For example, a Detroit story allowed readers to explore a database of all 43,000 properties on the brink of foreclosure in the city. Some sections of the news organization, like books and the magazine, have their own special projects editors. </p>
<p>Breaking news stories on the site are routinely supplemented by a mix of reporting, multimedia, graphics, and push notifications. The paper has expanded its digital operations aggressively in the 21st century with innovative graphics and photography, mobile apps, podcasts, and more. The Times has emphasized video content by pioneering 360-degree and virtual reality technology to distribute news and by featuring the documentary series, Op-Docs, which have earned Oscar nominations as well as Emmy and Peabody awards since the Opinion section began producing them in 2011. Starting later in 2018, The Times will produce a television show in partnership with FX and Hulu.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Credibility</h3>
<p>The Times' staff of over 1,450 journalists publish stories with original reporting by conducting first-hand interviews, referencing primary sources, and verifying stories broken by other outlets. Their work is scrutinized intensely due to the paper’s scale and influence. Its errors gain widespread notice. The paper has been involved in high-profile editorial scandals, including significant fabrications by former reporter Jayson Blair, which led to the 2003 departure of the paper’s executive and managing editors as well as an extensive review of the paper’s editorial practices. The Times published a report with its findings, which created standards and Public Editor positions at the paper.</p>
<p>The paper has consistently endorsed Democratic candidates in presidential elections and has not backed a Republican since President Dwight Eisenhower in 1956. Its editorials are generally liberal on social, cultural, and economic issues. Its coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a source of heated controversy, nearly always seen by one side as favoring the other, and prompted a 2014 Public Editor analysis that offered both criticisms and suggestions for improvement, including a need to “penetrate Palestinian society with understanding and solid news judgment.”</p>
<p>The Times’ news coverage is seen as resolutely liberal by conservatives, an image that Baquet has discussed publicly. “I would be lying if I did not say that a newsroom that is largely built in Manhattan does not have liberal leanings in the lifestyles and attitudes of its employees,” he said at a 2018 “Future of News” event held by the Financial Times. “That would be nuts if I said that. What I will say is that we have in our culture, and in our institution, a set of safeguards in editing that force us, that allow us, to kind of achieve that balance despite that.” In a separate magazine interview, Managing Editor Joseph Kahn said the paper "has made it really clear that we consider it crucial to our future that we not become an opposition-news organization. We do not see ourselves, and we do not wish to be seen, as partisan media. That means that the news and opinion divide, and things like social media guidelines and some of our traditional restrictions on political activity by employees, may feel cumbersome to some people at this point in our evolution.”</p>
<p>The editorial page reports to the newspaper’s publisher, not to executive editor Baquet, who oversees news coverage. That divide, typical at many large newspapers, can be lost on critics. It was on display in September, 2018 when, unknown to the newsroom and the paper's White House reporters, the page set aside its own practice by publishing a rare anonymous op-ed essay by a "senior administration official" that derided President Trump's alleged "amorality" and "reckless decisions." The writer claimed an ongoing "quiet resistance" within the administration toward Trump, who then lashed out at what he called a "gutless editorial," suggested the writer was committing treason, and called for the paper to disclose the writer's identity for "national security purposes." The paper said that granting anonymity was "the only way to deliver an important perspective to our readers" from a source "whose job would be jeopardized by its disclosure. Meanwhile, the paper's news side was left with the dilemma of whether it should join reporters working at other news organizations who were trying to uncover the identity of the author or sit out that effort because it would involve undercutting the promise of anonymity that its editorial page colleagues had promised.</p>
<p>Reporting done by The Times often drives news coverage done by other major American news outlets, regardless of those outlets’ own ideology. During the 2015-2016 presidential campaign, for example, The Times’s influence—and its aggressive coverage of both sides of the political divide—was evident in exclusive stories on the use of a private email server by Hillary Clinton while serving as Secretary of State and on Russian interference in the election.</p>
<p>The site includes separate emails or phone numbers for those seeking corrections on news stories and editorials. It runs corrections on a daily basis, with a senior editor and a news assistant assigned exclusively to corrections. High-profile corrections include its response to criticism of a July 23, 2015, story that indicated inspectors general in the government sought a Justice Department criminal investigation "into whether Hillary Rodham Clinton mishandled sensitive government information on a private email account she used as secretary of state." There were two separate corrections and a lengthier Editor's Note, which said that the corrections should have run sooner.</p>
<p>The Times has won 125 Pulitzer Prizes—more than any newspaper—including 2018 wins for reporting on powerful sexual predators and on Russian influence in the 2016 presidential campaign. The Times’s sexual violence investigations were a catalyst for the #MeToo movement.</p>

<h3>Transparency</h3>
<p>The New York Times website discloses information about many (but not all) reporters and editors, allowing readers to click on their names to find biographical information and other stories by them. It also links to the New York Times Company website, where readers can find financial and investor information, as well as the company’s history, the current leadership, and the company’s extensive standards and ethics policies. In late August 2018, The Times released a redesign of the site that eliminated most bylines from its home page, although they still appear on the articles. Some media watchers suggested the change could hurt the paper's credibility, Politico reported. "Wow, we've gone back to 1942, it seems," tweeted George Washington University professor Nikki Usher, according to Politico. "The rise of bylines was part of the growth of accountability journalism."</p>
<p>In 2017, The Times eliminated the position of Public Editor, a role intended to address reader concerns and editorial practices. Then-publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said the move reflected changes in social media and the internet that combine “to collectively serve as a modern watchdog, more vigilant and forceful than one person could ever be. Our responsibility is to empower all of those watchdogs, and to listen to them, rather than to channel their voice through a single office.” Some criticized the move as overestimating the role of social media as a surrogate for a full-time Public Editor. The doubters include former Public Editor Margaret Sullivan, who by then had moved to The Washington Post to become a columnist.</p>
<p>Concurrently, The Times established its Reader Center, an editorial team aimed at engaging readers, increasing the paper’s transparency, and maintaining loyal subscribers. The section solicits comment or ideas from readers, and it regularly publishes discussions of feedback to controversial stories or explanations of the reporting process. One series, titled “Understanding The Times,” seeks to explain to readers the news organization’s basic journalistic practices, such as its use of anonymous sources or corrections policy.</p>
<p>The Times is also transparent about high-profile personnel controversies. For example, in 2018 the email and phone records of Washington reporter Ali Watkins were seized by federal prosecutors as part of a case against a Senate Intelligence Committee aide who had allegedly leaked information to her and with whom she had an affair. The communication in question took place before Watkins started working at The Times, but the company conducted an internal review after the incident came to light. Afterward, The Times published a long story about their relationship and the journalism ethics questions it raised. The Times disclosed in a separate news story that she would be reassigned to a beat in New York and given a mentor.</p>
<p>On two occasions, The Times has allowed documentary filmmakers inside the news organization. The 2011 "Page One: Inside the New York Times" caught the paper amid a drastic industry downturn and layoffs. Showtime's 2018 four-part "The Fourth Estate" covered 16 months at the paper, including the first year of the Trump presidency.</p>
<p>When it comes to corrections, a senior editor is assigned full-time to the process. The editor has a full-time assistant and they work with more than 30 editors in various subject areas who oversee investigating possible errors in those areas.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>Founded in 1851, The New York Times grew significantly throughout the 20th century and looked beyond local coverage to become one of the nation’s most significant media institutions. The news organization has been involved in high-profile Supreme Court cases involving freedom of the press and freedom of speech. It won a major case concerning libel law in 1964 and another concerning prior restraint in 1971 over its publication of the Pentagon Papers, a secret government history of the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>Its range has been broad. In 1970 it exposed how gamblers, drug dealers, and small businesses made “illicit payments of millions of dollars a year to the policemen of New York” (a key source, a loner and bohemian police officer named Frank Serpico, inspired the Hollywood film “Serpico,” starring Al Pacino). Reporter Sydney Schanberg’s accounts of the fall of Cambodia won a 1972 Pulitzer and inspired “The Killing Fields,” which won three Academy Awards. (Schanberg was portrayed by Sam Waterston.) A daily special section, “A Nation Challenged,” captured the national mood and fear in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. A 2005 series on secret domestic eavesdropping by the government predated by eight years disclosures of secret surveillance programs of the National Security Agency leaked by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor. Its more recent sexual violence stories may prove a cultural turning point.</p>
<p>The Times history includes serious missteps, perhaps the most notable being the 1931 Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting from the Stalin-era Soviet Union by Walter Duranty, a celebrated foreign correspondent. His work has been thoroughly discredited for accepting Soviet propaganda and underplaying Stalin’s brutality, including the collectivization of agriculture that led to famine deaths of millions of people in the Ukraine. The paper thoroughly acknowledged the reporting as flawed, but the Pulitzer board has declined to revoke the 1932 award.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure: Joyce Purnick, a deputy managing editor at NewsGuard, is a former reporter, editor, editorial board member and New York City political columnist at The New York Times. Her husband, Max Frankel, was The Times's executive editor, editorial page editor, and a Pulitzer Prize-winning foreign correspondent.</em></p>
